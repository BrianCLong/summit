# Issue Closed: graph_time_series_forecasting_module

This issue has been resolved and is now closed.

## Summary

Implemented a forecasting module that analyzes graph-structured time series to predict future relationships and trends.
It forecasts anomalies for upcoming windows with banded confidence scores and renders them inline on the graph timeline.

## Implementation Details

- Leveraged temporal graph neural network techniques for predictions.
- Added evaluation harness to compare forecasts against historical data.
- Enabled time-bound anomaly forecasting that predicts anomalies for the next three time windows with banded confidence scores.
- Visualized forecasted anomalies directly on the graph timeline for intuitive analysis.

## Next Steps

- Run hyperparameter searches to boost forecast accuracy.
- Connect forecast outputs into real-time alerting pipelines.
- Monitor model performance and retrain when accuracy degrades.
