# curriculum.yaml
# Defines the stages of the research. The auto-scientist will progress
# through these stages sequentially based on the results of the experiments.

stages:
  - name: "baseline"
    description: "Establish a simple, reproducible baseline model to understand the problem's difficulty."
    goals:
      - "Run a standard model (e.g., Logistic Regression with TF-IDF) to get an initial performance metric."
      - "Ensure the data loading and evaluation pipeline is working correctly."
    constraints:
      # Stop this stage once a single run achieves an accuracy of at least 0.85
      required_metrics:
        accuracy: 0.85
      # Or, stop after a maximum of 3 runs to avoid getting stuck.
      max_runs: 3

  - name: "improvement"
    description: "Iteratively try to improve upon the baseline by exploring model types and hyperparameters."
    goals:
      - "Experiment with different model architectures or more advanced feature engineering."
      - "Tune key hyperparameters to optimize the target metric."
    constraints:
      required_metrics:
        accuracy: 0.90
      max_runs: 10

  - name: "robustness_check"
    description: "Test the best model's robustness and generalization capabilities."
    goals:
      - "Evaluate the model on a held-out test set or a dataset with a slight distribution shift."
      - "Analyze potential failure modes."
    constraints:
      required_metrics:
        # The goal is to maintain performance on the new data.
        test_accuracy: 0.88
      max_runs: 5
