# Freedom to Operate (FTO) Analysis Stub

## 1. Search Scope
-   **Keywords**: "Automated Science", "AI Safety", "Constitutional AI", "Recursive Oversight".
-   **Databases**: USPTO, Google Patents, ArXiv.

## 2. Identified Risks
-   **Risk A**: Anthropic "Constitutional AI" patents (if any).
    -   *Mitigation*: Our specific focus is on "Scientific Discovery" DAG execution, not general chat alignment.
-   **Risk B**: DeepMind "AlphaFold" related IP.
    -   *Mitigation*: We are claim-agnostic to the specific model architecture (Transformer vs GNN).

## 3. Design Arounds
-   Avoid claiming the specific training method (RLHF); focus on the *inference-time* oversight loop.
-   Emphasize the *integration* with the Execution Engine (the "Loop").
