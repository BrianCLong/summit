# Freedom to Operate (FTO) Analysis Stub

## 1. Search Scope

- **Keywords**: "Automated Science", "AI Safety", "Constitutional AI", "Recursive Oversight".
- **Databases**: USPTO, Google Patents, ArXiv.

## 2. Identified Risks

- **Risk A**: Anthropic "Constitutional AI" patents (if any).
  - _Mitigation_: Our specific focus is on "Scientific Discovery" DAG execution, not general chat alignment.
- **Risk B**: DeepMind "AlphaFold" related IP.
  - _Mitigation_: We are claim-agnostic to the specific model architecture (Transformer vs GNN).

## 3. Design Arounds

- Avoid claiming the specific training method (RLHF); focus on the _inference-time_ oversight loop.
- Emphasize the _integration_ with the Execution Engine (the "Loop").
