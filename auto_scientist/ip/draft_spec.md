**Title:** SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATED SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY WITH RECURSIVE OVERSIGHT

## Abstract

A system for automated scientific discovery that employs a recursive oversight loop to ensure generated hypotheses adhere to pre-defined safety and validity constraints. The system comprises a generator model, an oversight model, and an execution engine.

## Background

Traditional automated scientific discovery systems lack robust safety guarantees, often generating scientifically invalid or hazardous hypotheses.

## Summary

The present invention provides a method for "Safe Automated Science" by interleaving generation steps with a dedicated, constitution-based oversight step.

## Embodiments

1.  **Single-Loop Embodiment**: One generator, one discriminator.
2.  **Multi-Modal Embodiment**: Oversight includes checking generated diagrams/images.
3.  **Federated Embodiment**: Oversight model runs in a secure enclave.
