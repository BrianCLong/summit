\*Projected based on pipeline performance

### Architecture Highlights

#### Multi-Stage Docker Build

```dockerfile
# Optimized for caching and security
FROM node:18-alpine AS base
FROM base AS development
FROM base AS build
FROM base AS production
# Service-specific targets
FROM production AS sei-collector
FROM production AS v24-activities
```

#### Agent Chain Example

```
Issue → Planner (creates task DAG)
      → Scaffolder (branch + boilerplate)
      → Implementer (code changes)
      → Tester (runs affected tests)
      → Reviewer (security + quality)
      → Docs (provenance + changelog)
```

#### Policy Enforcement

```typescript
// Every agent task goes through policy guard
const policyResult = await policyGuard.checkPolicy(task);
if (!policyResult.allowed) {
  throw new Error(`Task blocked: ${policyResult.reason}`);
}
```

### Governance & Compliance

#### Provenance Manifests

Every CI run generates provenance with:

- Build results and security scan status
- Policy compliance verification
- SBOM and vulnerability reports
- Actor and commit traceability

#### Cost Guardrails

- Monthly budget caps in `.maestro/ci_budget.json`
- Per-PR LLM spending limits with alerts at 80%/95%
- Automatic downshift recommendations (smaller models)

#### Security Gates

- CodeQL analysis on all PRs
- Container vulnerability scanning (fails on critical)
- Dependency auditing with safety checks
- Policy violations block with human-readable reasons

### Operational Readiness

#### Monitoring Stack

- **Metrics**: Prometheus scrapes on `:9464/metrics`
- **Traces**: Jaeger collector for distributed debugging
- **Logs**: Structured JSON with correlation IDs
- **Alerts**: PagerDuty integration for critical failures

#### Deployment

```bash
# Development
docker-compose up -d

# Production with all services
docker build --target production -t maestro:v0.3 .
docker run -p 4000:4000 -p 8080:8080 -p 9464:9464 maestro:v0.3
```

#### Weekly Learning Pack

Auto-generated markdown reports with:

- Top failures and cost spikes analysis
- DORA trends and team velocity metrics
