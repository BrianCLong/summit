# IntelGraph Vulnerability Management

## Overview

This document outlines the vulnerability management process for the IntelGraph platform, including identification, assessment, remediation, and tracking of security vulnerabilities across the entire technology stack.

## Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

### 1. Discovery and Identification

#### Automated Scanning

- **Container Images**: Trivy scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependencies**: Dependabot alerts, npm audit, Snyk
- **Code**: CodeQL SAST, SonarQube, ESLint security rules
- **Infrastructure**: Kube-bench, Falco runtime detection
- **Web Application**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Professional

#### Manual Assessment

- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly external assessments
- **Code Review**: Security-focused peer reviews
- **Architecture Review**: Threat modeling updates
- **Security Research**: Industry vulnerability feeds

### 2. Assessment and Prioritization

#### Severity Classification

| Severity | CVSS Score | SLA      | Description                | Examples                            |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Critical | 9.0-10.0   | 24 hours | Immediate threat to system | RCE, Authentication bypass          |
| High     | 7.0-8.9    | 72 hours | Significant security risk  | Privilege escalation, Data exposure |
| Medium   | 4.0-6.9    | 2 weeks  | Moderate security impact   | XSS, Information disclosure         |
| Low      | 0.1-3.9    | 1 month  | Minor security concern     | DoS, Configuration issues           |
| Info     | 0.0        | 3 months | Security awareness         | Best practices, Hardening           |

#### Risk Factors

**Exploitability Assessment**:

- Public exploit availability
- Attack complexity and prerequisites
- Network accessibility
- Authentication requirements

**Business Impact Analysis**:

- Data sensitivity and classification
- System criticality and availability requirements
- Regulatory compliance implications
- Reputation and financial impact

#### Prioritization Matrix

```
High Business Impact + High Exploitability = P0 (Critical)
High Business Impact + Low Exploitability  = P1 (High)
Low Business Impact  + High Exploitability = P2 (Medium)
Low Business Impact  + Low Exploitability  = P3 (Low)
```

### 3. Remediation Planning

#### Remediation Strategies

1. **Patch Management**
   - Apply vendor security patches
   - Test in staging environment
   - Coordinate maintenance windows
   - Roll back procedures

2. **Configuration Changes**
   - Security hardening
   - Access control updates
   - Network segmentation
   - Monitoring improvements

3. **Workarounds**
