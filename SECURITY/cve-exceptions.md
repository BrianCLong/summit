## Process for Adding New CVE Exceptions

### When is it acceptable to ignore a CVE?

1. **False Positive:** The vulnerability doesn't actually exist in our usage context
2. **No Fix Available:** No patched version exists and we've implemented compensating controls
3. **Transitive Dependency:** Direct upgrade not possible, awaiting upstream fix
4. **Low Risk:** Vulnerability requires conditions that don't exist in our deployment (must be documented)

### Required Documentation for Each Exception

1. **CVE Details:**
   - Full CVE description
   - CVSS score and vector
   - Affected package and version range

2. **Exploitability Assessment:**
   - How would an attacker exploit this in Summit?
   - What are the prerequisites?
   - What is the impact?

3. **Risk Acceptance:**
   - Why are we accepting this risk?
   - Who approved the risk acceptance?
   - When was it approved?

4. **Mitigation Plan:**
   - What compensating controls are in place?
   - When will we revisit this decision?
   - What is the plan to remove this exception?

### Review Cadence

- **Quarterly:** Review all CVE exceptions
- **On Upgrade:** Re-evaluate when upgrading affected packages
- **On Incident:** If similar vulnerability is exploited elsewhere
