## CVE-2024-22363 (RESOLVED)

### Description
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED (2026-02-06)**

**Package:** xlsx/SheetJS
**Vulnerability:** ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (HIGH)
**CWE:** CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)

### Resolution
Fixed via pnpm override in `package.json`:
```json
"xlsx": "https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.3/xlsx-0.20.3.tgz"
```

Version 0.20.3 includes the fix for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2023-30533 (RESOLVED)

### Description
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED (2026-02-06)**

**Package:** xlsx/SheetJS
**Vulnerability:** Prototype Pollution when reading specially crafted files
**CVSS Score:** 7.8 (HIGH)
**CWE:** CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes)

### Resolution
Fixed via pnpm override in `package.json`:
```json
"xlsx": "https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.3/xlsx-0.20.3.tgz"
```

Version 0.20.3 (which includes 0.19.3+ fixes) resolves this vulnerability.

## CVE-2022-24434 (RESOLVED)

### Description
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED (2026-02-06)**

**Package:** dicer (via busboy)
**Vulnerability:** Denial of Service via malformed headers
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (HIGH)
**CWE:** CWE-248 (Uncaught Exception)

### Previous State
The vulnerable dependency chain was:
- `apollo-server-testing` → `apollo-server-core` → `@apollographql/graphql-upload-8-fork` → `busboy@0.3.1` → `dicer@0.3.0`

### Resolution
Fixed via pnpm override in `package.json`:
```json
"busboy": ">=1.6.0"
```

busboy 1.6.0+ does not depend on dicer and is not vulnerable to this CVE.

## CVE-2023-28155 (NOT APPLICABLE)

### Description
**Status:** ⚪ **NOT APPLICABLE**

**Package:** request
**Vulnerability:** SSRF bypass via cross-protocol redirects
**CVSS Score:** 6.1 (MEDIUM)
**CWE:** CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery)

### Assessment
The `request` package is not a direct dependency in the Summit codebase. The lockfile contains `postman-request@2.88.1-postman.47`, which is a separate maintained fork by Postman with different security characteristics.

This CVE was previously ignored without investigation. After investigation, it was determined to not apply to our dependency tree.

## Process for Adding New CVE Exceptions

### When is it acceptable to ignore a CVE?

1. **False Positive:** The vulnerability doesn't actually exist in our usage context
2. **No Fix Available:** No patched version exists and we've implemented compensating controls
3. **Transitive Dependency:** Direct upgrade not possible, awaiting upstream fix
4. **Low Risk:** Vulnerability requires conditions that don't exist in our deployment (must be documented)

### Required Documentation for Each Exception

1. **CVE Details:**
   - Full CVE description
   - CVSS score and vector
   - Affected package and version range

2. **Exploitability Assessment:**
   - How would an attacker exploit this in Summit?
   - What are the prerequisites?
   - What is the impact?

3. **Risk Acceptance:**
   - Why are we accepting this risk?
   - Who approved the risk acceptance?
   - When was it approved?

4. **Mitigation Plan:**
   - What compensating controls are in place?
   - When will we revisit this decision?
   - What is the plan to remove this exception?

### Review Cadence

- **Quarterly:** Review all CVE exceptions
- **On Upgrade:** Re-evaluate when upgrading affected packages
- **On Incident:** If similar vulnerability is exploited elsewhere
