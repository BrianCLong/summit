# IntelGraph Threat Model

## Overview

This document outlines the threat model for the IntelGraph AI-augmented intelligence analysis platform, identifying potential security risks, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Web Application** (`apps/web`) - React frontend for user interface
2. **API Gateway** (`services/gateway`) - Authentication and request routing
3. **Core API** (`server`) - Business logic and data processing
4. **AI Services** (`services/ai`) - Machine learning and analysis engines
5. **Database Layer** - PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis for data persistence
6. **File Storage** - S3-compatible storage for documents and artifacts

### Trust Boundaries

- **Internet → WAF/CDN** - External traffic filtering
- **WAF → Load Balancer** - DDoS protection and SSL termination
- **Load Balancer → Application** - Internal network traffic
- **Application → Database** - Authenticated database connections
- **Application → External APIs** - Third-party integrations

## Threat Analysis

### STRIDE Methodology

#### Spoofing (S)

- **T001**: Unauthorized user impersonation
  - **Impact**: High - Access to sensitive intelligence data
  - **Mitigation**: Multi-factor authentication, JWT validation, session management

- **T002**: Service-to-service identity spoofing
  - **Impact**: High - Lateral movement within system
  - **Mitigation**: Mutual TLS, service mesh identity, SPIFFE/SPIRE

#### Tampering (T)

- **T003**: Data manipulation during transit
  - **Impact**: High - Compromised intelligence integrity
  - **Mitigation**: TLS 1.3, request signing, integrity checks

- **T004**: Container image tampering
  - **Impact**: Medium - Supply chain compromise
  - **Mitigation**: Image signing (Cosign), SBOM attestations, admission controllers

#### Repudiation (R)

- **T005**: Denial of actions performed
  - **Impact**: Medium - Audit trail compromise
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive audit logging, log integrity, non-repudiation signatures

#### Information Disclosure (I)

- **T006**: Sensitive data exposure
  - **Impact**: Critical - Intelligence data breach
  - **Mitigation**: Encryption at rest/transit, access controls, data classification

- **T007**: Metadata leakage
  - **Impact**: Medium - System architecture exposure
  - **Mitigation**: Header scrubbing, error message sanitization, observability data classification

#### Denial of Service (D)

- **T008**: Application layer attacks
  - **Impact**: High - Service unavailability
  - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, WAF rules, auto-scaling, circuit breakers

- **T009**: Resource exhaustion attacks
  - **Impact**: Medium - Performance degradation
  - **Mitigation**: Resource quotas, timeout policies, queue depth limits

#### Elevation of Privilege (E)

- **T010**: Container escape
  - **Impact**: Critical - Host system compromise
  - **Mitigation**: Non-privileged containers, security contexts, Pod Security Standards

- **T011**: Authorization bypass
  - **Impact**: High - Unauthorized data access
  - **Mitigation**: RBAC, least privilege, policy enforcement (OPA/Kyverno)

- **T012**: Policy Bypass via Fuzzing
  - **Impact**: Critical - Undetected policy violations leading to data breaches or compliance failures
  - **Mitigation**: Robust oracle, comprehensive attack grammars, metamorphic testing, continuous fuzzer development

## Abuse/Misuse Cases

- **Policy Fuzzer Misinterpretation**: Fuzzer results are misinterpreted, leading to incorrect policy changes or false sense of security.
- **Adversarial Fuzzer Use**: An attacker uses a similar fuzzer to discover policy bypasses in a deployed system.
