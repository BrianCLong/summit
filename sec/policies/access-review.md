# Access Review Policy

- Quarterly RBAC reviews by service owners; emergency access expires within 24 hours unless renewed.
- All access changes require ticket linkage and dual approval for privileged roles.
- Access attestations are logged with audit IDs and validated against HR status before provisioning.
