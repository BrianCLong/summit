# Data Retention Policy

- Retain operational telemetry for 30 days; aggregate metrics preserved for 13 months.
- Customer investigation data defaults to 180 days unless contract overrides; archival requires encryption at rest and access logging.
- Exports are tagged with expiration metadata and purged automatically when contracts terminate.
