# Executive Audit Readiness Memo

**To:** Summit Executive Leadership  
**From:** External Audit Readiness Lead  
**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Subject:** MVP-3-GA External Audit Dry-Run — Readiness Assessment

## Executive Summary

Summit is **near audit-ready**, but **not audit-ready today** due to missing decision records that auditors require as primary evidence. Core controls are strong and well-evidenced; remediation is targeted and can be completed within days.

## Readiness Assessment

**Status:** **Not audit-ready today**  
**Confidence:** High on controls; Medium on governance records

### What’s Working

- Evidence bundle is comprehensive and current (GA bundle dated 2025-12-27).
- Control inventory and mappings are traceable and accessible.
- CI governance and change management controls are enforced and evidenced.
- Security access controls and ABAC/RBAC decision trails are documented.

### What Must Be Fixed

1. **Go/No-Go decision record** must be signed and stored.
2. **Graduation decision evidence** must be captured and linked to the shipping graph.
3. **Expired security exception** must be closed or renewed with updated compensating controls.

## Why Leadership Can Be Confident

- The evidence infrastructure already exists and is current.
- Required fixes are procedural and time-boxed (no foundational rework).
- Live rollback evidence shows governance gates operate in production.

## Target Timeline

- **Within 7 days:** Complete Go/No-Go record, close/renew expired exception, document experiment exit criteria.
- **Within 30 days:** Record graduation decision in governance ledger; add CAB linkage to deployment logs.

## Recommendation

Proceed with immediate remediation to reach audit-ready status within one week. Schedule a second verification review once decision records are filed.
