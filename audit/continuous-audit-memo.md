# Executive Continuous Audit Memo

## Summary

Summit now produces versioned audit evidence automatically as a byproduct of CI, governance, and operations. Evidence is captured, cataloged, and validated on every gated run, so audit readiness is continuous instead of a manual project.

## How Evidence Is Generated

- **Evidence taxonomy** (`audit/evidence-taxonomy.json`) defines required domains, controls, retention, access scope, and traceability links.
- **Evidence catalog** (`audit/evidence-catalog.json`) is generated by `scripts/ops/generate-evidence-catalog.ts`, which hashes artifacts and stamps them with commit metadata.
- **Drift detection** (`scripts/ops/check-evidence-drift.ts`) blocks missing, stale, or broken evidence chains in CI.

## What Audits Look Like Now

Auditors query the evidence catalog (JSON) to retrieve the precise artifacts, hashes, and traceability links for any control. The catalog bridges claims → policy/decision → code/test → release → observed artifacts without manual reconstruction.

## Why Audit Cost and Risk Drop

- **Deterministic evidence capture** removes manual gathering and reduces human error.
- **Traceability links** enforce end-to-end chains from claim to behavior.
- **Retention and redaction policies** are explicit in the evidence schema, keeping auditor views safe and scoped.

Audit readiness is now an automated, repeatable system. Audits are read-only queries, not initiatives.
