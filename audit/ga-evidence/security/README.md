6. **MITIGATION-MAPPING.md** - Comprehensive mapping of all threats to SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria with mitigation strategies
7. **SOC2-ALIGNMENT-MATRIX.md** - Detailed gap analysis and SOC 2 compliance assessment

## Summary

### Threats Identified

- **Total Threats:** 84
- **Critical:** 47 (56%)
- **High:** 23 (27%)
- **Medium:** 14 (17%)

### Subsystem Breakdown

| Subsystem       | Critical | High | Medium | Total |
| --------------- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Graph Database  | 13       | 3    | 2      | 18    |
| Agent Execution | 12       | 5    | 4      | 21    |
| Data Ingest     | 9        | 4    | 3      | 16    |
| AI Copilot      | 8        | 5    | 3      | 16    |
| API Gateway     | 5        | 6    | 2      | 13    |

### SOC 2 Compliance Status

**Overall Status:** 🔴 NOT READY FOR SOC 2 TYPE II AUDIT

- **Fully Compliant:** 2 criteria (9%)
- **Partially Compliant:** 9 criteria (39%)
- **Non-Compliant:** 12 criteria (52%)

### Critical Gaps

1. **Authentication & Authorization** - 17 critical gaps across all subsystems
2. **Availability Controls** - 11 critical DoS vulnerabilities
3. **Data Protection** - 8 critical confidentiality gaps
4. **Audit Logging** - Complete gaps in monitoring and logging
5. **Input Validation** - 6 critical injection vulnerabilities

### Remediation Timeline

- **Week 1 (P0):** Critical blockers - authentication, rate limiting, security headers
- **Month 1:** Authentication infrastructure, RBAC, centralized logging, SIEM
- **Month 2:** Advanced controls, DDoS protection, encryption, privacy controls
- **Month 3:** Audit preparation, penetration testing, documentation

### Budget Estimate

- **One-time Investment:** $280K - $470K
- **Annual Recurring:** $70K - $120K (primarily tooling/monitoring)

### Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH GA RELEASE** until critical security gaps are addressed.

Recommended approach:

1. Implement Week 1 emergency controls
2. Complete Month 1-2 remediation
3. Conduct external security assessment
4. Phased GA rollout with security monitoring

## Methodology

- **Framework:** STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- **Scoring:** DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability)
- **Standards:** SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy)

## Evidence Integrity

All threat models were generated through:

1. Code review of actual implementation
2. Architecture analysis
3. Dependency assessment
4. Industry best practices
5. OWASP and CWE references

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Executive review and decision on GA timeline
2. **Week 1:** Begin P0 remediation
3. **Weekly:** Security progress reviews
4. **Monthly:** SOC 2 readiness assessment
