# Tests

## TODO

- [ ] Implement unit tests for all core components.
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the full system.
- [ ] Implement cognitive simulation tests.
- [ ] Implement Playwright tests for the UI.
- [ ] Implement ethical benchmark tests.

This directory contains the comprehensive test suite for the SummitCogWar project, ensuring the reliability, correctness, and ethical performance of all components.

## Test Categories

- **Unit Tests:** Fine-grained tests for individual functions and classes.
- **Integration Tests:** Tests that verify the interactions between different components of the system.
