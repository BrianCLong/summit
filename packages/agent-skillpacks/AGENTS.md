# AGENTS.md - agent-skillpacks package instructions

- Use TypeScript with strict typing and no implicit `any`.
- Prefer pure functions; avoid side effects unless writing evidence artifacts.
- Keep tests deterministic and mock time or filesystem interactions where needed.
- No `console.log` in package code.
