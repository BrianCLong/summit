# Analytics Architecture

## Purpose

Provide a shared analytics layer that:

- Aggregates signals about code health, tests, and system behavior.
- Supports Predictive and other agents with structured context.
- Feeds the autonomous improvement loop.

## Components

- `SIGNALS.md` – catalog of signals and sources.
- `MODELS.yaml` – logical models and analyses.
- `ROUTING.md` – how signals/models feed agents and flows.
