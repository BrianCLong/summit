## 1) One‑Page Executive Brief
**Vision (1‑liner):** *A verifiable OSINT copilot on a provenance‑first graph, federating allies without moving raw data, and producing decision‑ready briefs with proofs, not promises.*

**Why now:** Data volumes, anti‑scraping controls, and regulatory scrutiny are up; analysts need speed **and** trust. We deliver faster triage and deeper confidence with cryptographic provenance, explainable analytics, and policy‑bound automation.

**Core bets:**
- **Proof‑Carrying Analytics:** Every result ships with lineage, license, and model cards.
- **Zero‑Copy Federation:** Cross‑tenant checks via zero‑knowledge claims; share *proofs*, not data.
- **Analyst Augmentation:** Glass‑box agents that can be stepped, edited, and cited.
- **Governance by Design:** Authority/License compiler makes unsafe actions unexecutable.

**2‑Quarter MVP Outcomes:**
- TTI (time‑to‑insight) ↓ by 40% on labeled cases.
- False‑positive rate at triage ≤ 2% on benchmark suites.
- Evidence bundles export with verifiable manifests; 100% citation coverage.
- Live federation POC with 2 external partners (no raw PII exchange).

**Primary users:** Threat intel, DFIR, vetting/screening, fraud/AML, crisis ops, research.

## 2) Capability Delta — **Beyond‑2025**
> What we deliver that typical 2025 tools don’t combine in one place.

### 2.1 Verifiable Trust Fabric
- **Proof‑Carrying Queries (PCQ):** Hash tree of inputs→transforms→outputs; one‑click verifier.
- **Portable Provenance Wallets:** Time‑boxed, audience‑scoped evidence bundles (press/court/partner) with revocation.
- **License & Authority Compiler:** Compile warrants, licenses, DPAs into query bytecode; blocked actions return human‑readable reasons.

### 2.2 Federated Leverage (No‑Copy)
- **ZK Deconfliction:** Overlap checks on hashed selectors (people/assets) with zero disclosure.
- **Semantic Delta Sync:** Exchange only meaningful graph changes (motifs/claims), not raw docs.

### 2.3 Analyst‑First Autonomy
- **Glass‑Box Agents:** Full prompts, tool calls, and rationale; step/fork at any node.
- **Runbook Provers:** Each playbook emits machine‑checkable pre/post‑condition proofs (citations present, scope respected).

### 2.4 Counter‑Deception & Narrative Physics
- **Fabrication Radar:** Multi‑modal integrity checks (metadata sanity, contradiction graphs).
- **Narrative Field Maps:** Forecast spread/decay; show lowest‑risk intervention corridors.

### 2.5 Ops, Cost & Reliability
- **Unit‑Cost Governor:** $/insight indicators; cheaper equivalent plans suggested.
- **Offline Expedition Kits:** Edge analysis with CRDT sync and proof‑carrying results.

**Acceptance Targets (MVP):** p95 3‑hop graph query < 1.5s; ingest→resolve 10k docs < 5m; 0 uncited assertions in exports; revocation propagates within 15 minutes.

6) **ZK Deconfliction (POC):** Cross‑tenant overlap proofs without data spill.
   - *AC:* Demonstrate true/false overlap against synthetic hashed selectors.

### 3.2 Should/Could (Post‑MVP)
