# Issue Closed: osint_data_integration

This issue has been resolved and is now closed.

## Completion Details

- Connected external open-source intelligence feeds to enrich graph data.
- Normalized incoming records and added health checks for each provider.
- Introduced automated feed prioritization based on quality, recency, and semantic density.

## Ongoing Enhancements

- Automate feed updates and fallbacks for failing sources using scheduler and health check retries.
- Correlate OSINT signals with internal events for higher fidelity alerts through cross-source scoring.
- Archive raw feed data for retrospective analysis and audit.
- Expose ranking weights via admin UI to tune prioritization of quality vs. freshness vs. semantic density.
  The ingestion agent now computes source weights using the above factors and sentiment of the query,
  normalizing scores so the highest priority feeds are polled first. Admins can adjust weighting
  through `/api/admin/osint-feed-config` or the OSINT Feed settings page.
