# IntelGraph
**Synthetic Fusion for Intelligence Analysis.**

IntelGraph unifies OSINT, graph analytics, GenAI/GraphRAG, and agentic runbooks to deliver end‑to‑end Threat‑to‑Response (TDIR) in one open, explainable platform.

### Why now
Fragmented tools force swivel‑chair investigations. IntelGraph fuses **Shared** features (TI, SIEM integration, visualization, entity resolution, etc.) with **Unique** edges (GraphRAG, Agentic AI, index‑free adjacency, dynamic exploration) into a cohesive analyst experience.

### MVP Scope (30 days)
- Neo4j persistence (temporal edges + confidence)
- Streamlit UI (neighborhood, multi‑hop path, timeline)
- OSINT connector framework (Wikipedia demo)
- GenAI‑assisted Q&A over graph (GraphRAG prototype)

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for next phases and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design.
