> **üéº Important:** **Maestro builds IntelGraph. Maestro is separate from IntelGraph.** Maestro is the standalone orchestration service that coordinates the building, testing, and deployment of IntelGraph through intelligent automation. See [Maestro documentation](./docs/maestro/) for the build conductor details.

## Overview

IntelGraph is an AI-augmented intelligence analysis platform that enables analysts to create, query, and visualize complex knowledge graphs with integrated AI capabilities for enhanced insight generation.

## Architecture

IntelGraph consists of several key components:

- **Graph Database Layer**: Neo4j-based knowledge graph storage
- **AI Enhancement Engine**: Multi-provider LLM integration for entity extraction and analysis
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket-based collaborative analysis sessions
- **Security Framework**: RBAC/ABAC with policy-driven access controls
- **Provenance System**: Cryptographic verification of data lineage and analysis chains

## Getting Started

## SDKs

First-class SDKs are available for interacting with the Maestro API.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40intelgraph%2Fmaestro-sdk.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@intelgraph/maestro-sdk)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/maestro-sdk.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/maestro-sdk/)

### TypeScript SDK

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install @intelgraph/maestro-sdk
# or
yarn add @intelgraph/maestro-sdk
```

**Quickstart:**

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@intelgraph/maestro-sdk';

const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8080'; // Your Maestro API URL
const TOKEN = 'your_auth_token'; // Your authentication token

async function main() {
  const client = createClient(BASE_URL, TOKEN);

  try {
    console.log('Listing runs...');
    const runs = await client.listRuns();
    console.log('Runs:', runs.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error listing runs:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

### Python SDK

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install maestro-sdk
```

**Quickstart:**

```python
import asyncio
from maestro_sdk.client import MaestroClient

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080"  # Your Maestro API URL
TOKEN = "your_auth_token"  # Your authentication token

async def main():
    client = MaestroClient(base_url=BASE_URL, token=TOKEN)

    try:
        print("Listing runs...")
        runs = await client.runs_list() # Using the low-level generated client method
        if runs:
            for run in runs:
                print(f"Run ID: {run['id']}, Status: {run['status']}")
        else:
            print("No runs found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error listing runs: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Build specific package
npm run build --workspace=server
```

## Evaluation & Benchmarking

The platform includes an offline evaluation and benchmarking harness that runs nightly.
Results, including quality, latency, and cost metrics, are published to dashboards.
A JSON artifact of the results (`eval/out/results.json`) is also generated.

For more details, refer to the [Evaluation Harness documentation](./docs/eval-harness.md) (to be created).

## Security

IntelGraph implements defense-in-depth security:

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / OIDC with JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) via OPA
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive analysis data
- **Supply Chain**: SBOM generation, artifact signing, and provenance tracking
- **Network Security**: mTLS for service-to-service communication

## Deployment

IntelGraph supports multiple deployment models:

- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Staging**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
- **Production**: Multi-region Kubernetes with HA configurations

Deployments are orchestrated by Maestro with policy-enforced promotion gates.

## Maestro Conductor Go-Live Plan (Dev/Build)

To make the Maestro Conductor service production-ready for go-live in the dev/build environment, follow these key steps:

### Immediate Acceleration Wins

The following immediate wins have been implemented or are ready for activation:

- **Ephemeral PR Environments**: Automated deployment of PRs via Helm with unique namespaces.
- **Golden Path Makefile**: One-liners for common development and deployment tasks (e.g., `make dev up`, `make test`, `make deploy-dev`, `make preview`).
- **Observability Drop-in**: Integration of Prometheus metrics and basic OpenTelemetry tracing.
- **Health Probes**: Implementation of `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` endpoints.
- **SBOM+Scan+Sign**: Automated SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning (Trivy), and image signing (Cosign) in CI.
- **Idempotency Middleware**: Ensures replay-safe workflow execution.
- **Policy Gate**: Minimal OPA policy to restrict production-target deployments from dev roles.

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Populate Secrets**: Ensure `k8s/maestro-production-secrets.yaml` is populated with your actual secret values.
2.  **Apply Configuration**: The `k8s/maestro-production-configmap.yaml` contains the necessary configuration.
3.  **Run Deployment Script**: Execute the comprehensive deployment script:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy-maestro-production.sh deploy
    ```
    This script handles prerequisites, validation, namespace creation, applying configs/secrets, Helm deployment, health checks, smoke tests, and report generation.
