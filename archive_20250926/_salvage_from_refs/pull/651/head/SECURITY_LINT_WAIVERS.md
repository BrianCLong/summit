# Security Lint Waivers

Use this log to track temporary waivers for security lint rule violations. Each entry must include an owner and an expiry no more than 30 days out.

| Rule      | Count (baseline) | Example files         | Risk         | Owner  | Expiry (≤30d) | Resolution Plan         |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ----------------------- |

> CI blocks **new** security rule violations on changed files. Waivers only apply to existing issues until resolved.
