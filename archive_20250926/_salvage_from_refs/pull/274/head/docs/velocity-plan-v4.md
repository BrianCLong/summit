IntelGraph — Velocity Plan v4: Tenant Safety & Performance Hardening

Owner: Guy — Theme: multi-tenant isolation + big graph performance

Priorities

Tenant isolation across API/Neo4j/Postgres/Redis + OPA tests

Neighborhood cache with invalidation

Neo4j indexing pass & query hints

Cytoscape LOD for large graphs

PR scaffolds

security/multi-tenant — feat(security): enforce tenant scoping across API/DB/cache

perf/neighborhood-cache — feat(perf): Redis neighborhood cache + invalidation

perf/neo4j-indexing — feat(perf): Neo4j indexes + query tuning

ui/cytoscape-lod — feat(ui): LOD for large graphs

Acceptance criteria

No cross-tenant reads/writes; OPA/unit tests pass

Neighborhood cache hit ≥70%; invalidation verified

Hot endpoint p95 ↓≥30%; PROFILE shows index usage

50k elements interactive (<16ms/frame), labels toggle

Observability

Metrics: neighborhood_cache_hit_ratio, neo4j_query_ms

Alerts: cache hit <50% (warn), p95 query > target (warn)

Next steps

Cut branches, open draft PRs, wire tests into CI
