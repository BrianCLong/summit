Title: GA Readiness — 30/60/90 RACI

Scope: Progressive delivery, SLO burn-rate gates, synthetic NLQ probes, red-team harness, supply-chain attestations, DR drills, WebAuthn step-up, OPA policy gates, observability, HA pilot, SDK contracts, compliance prep.

Notes:
- Owners are initial placeholders; adjust to your teams and CODEOWNERS.
- Gates map to evidence artifacts (dashboards, reports, attestations) and CI policy checks.
