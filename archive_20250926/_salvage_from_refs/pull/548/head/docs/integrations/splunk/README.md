# Splunk Integration

This directory contains resources for exporting IntelGraph events to Splunk.

## Example Event
See [sprint-7-saved-searches.md](sprint-7-saved-searches.md) for sanitized event payloads and saved searches.

## Exporter
Server exporters strip PII fields by default and can be enabled with the `EXPORT_PII` feature flag.
