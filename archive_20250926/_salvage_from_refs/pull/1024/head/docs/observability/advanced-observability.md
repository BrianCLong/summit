# Advanced Observability Strategy

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the strategy for implementing advanced observability capabilities within the IntelGraph platform, enabling comprehensive monitoring, faster troubleshooting, and proactive issue detection.

## 2. Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry)

*   **Strategy**: Implement end-to-end distributed tracing across all microservices using OpenTelemetry. This allows visualizing the flow of requests through the system, identifying bottlenecks, and understanding service dependencies.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Instrumentation**: Instrument all services (Node.js, Python, etc.) with OpenTelemetry SDKs.
    *   **Context Propagation**: Ensure trace context (Trace ID, Span ID) is propagated across service boundaries (HTTP headers, message queues).
    *   **Collectors**: Deploy OpenTelemetry Collectors to receive, process, and export traces.
    *   **Backend**: Integrate with a tracing backend (e.g., Jaeger, Tempo, DataDog) for storage and visualization.

## 3. Log Correlation

*   **Strategy**: Correlate logs across different services and systems using trace IDs and other contextual information. This enables developers and SREs to quickly pinpoint the root cause of issues by linking related log entries.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Structured Logging**: Ensure all services emit structured logs (e.g., JSON format) with consistent fields (e.g., `trace_id`, `span_id`, `request_id`, `user_id`).
    *   **Log Aggregation**: Use a centralized log aggregation system (e.g., ELK Stack, OpenSearch, Splunk) to collect and index logs.
    *   **Correlation Queries**: Develop dashboards and queries within the log aggregation system to filter and correlate logs based on trace IDs.
    *   **Audit Log Integration**: Link application logs with audit logs (e.g., from OPA, database access logs) using common identifiers.

## 4. Synthetic Probes

*   **Strategy**: Deploy synthetic probes to actively test the availability, performance, and correctness of critical API endpoints (GraphQL, AI services, ETL) from an external perspective.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Tools**: Use tools like Prometheus Blackbox Exporter, UptimeRobot, or custom k6 scripts for synthetic monitoring.
    *   **GraphQL Probes**:
        *   Periodically execute critical GraphQL queries and mutations.
        *   Assert response times and data correctness.
    *   **AI Service Probes**:
        *   Send sample requests to AI prediction endpoints.
        *   Verify response latency and model output accuracy.
    *   **ETL Endpoint Probes**:
        *   Test data ingestion endpoints for availability and throughput.
    *   **Alerting**: Configure alerts for probe failures or performance degradation.

## 5. Dashboards and Alerts

*   **Unified Dashboards**: Create unified dashboards in Grafana (or similar) that combine metrics, logs, and traces for a holistic view of system health.
*   **SLO-based Alerts**: Configure alerts based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for critical services, ensuring proactive notification of potential issues.
*   **Runbook Integration**: Link alerts to relevant runbooks for efficient incident response.
