# IntelGraph AI-Analytics Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundational Enhancements (Month 1)
- [x] Integrate GraphSAGE or GAT model using PyTorch Geometric
- [x] Export models via ONNX for inference serving
- [ ] Implement async GNN prediction API (FastAPI or Flask)
- [ ] Graph-based anomaly detection (auto-alerts)

## Phase 2: Multimodal AI Fusion (Month 2)
- [ ] Context-aware prompt injection into LLMs
- [ ] Merge graph embeddings with LLM insight layers
- [ ] Streamlit to React migration for production analytics dashboard

## Phase 3: Real-Time Intelligence (Month 3)
- [ ] Kafka integration for real-time stream processing
- [ ] Online GNN training pipeline with continual learning
- [ ] AI-enhanced auto-triage suggestions

## Phase 4: Full Production Deployment (Month 4)
- [ ] Federate GraphQL services for plugin-like intel ingestion
- [ ] Add explainable AI (XAI) UI for graph decision paths
- [ ] Model monitoring with drift detection and retraining triggers
