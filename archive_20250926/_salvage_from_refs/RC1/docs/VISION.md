# Product Vision & Positioning

**Vision:** Become the default open intelligence graph for security, risk, and investigative analytics—delivering **explainable, real‑time insights** without vendor lock‑in.

**Target users:** SOC analysts, threat hunters, investigative journalists, fraud teams.

**Positioning:**
- **Against graph DB vendors:** We ship the *analyst workflow* with GenAI+Graph synergy, not just storage.
- **Against OSINT tools:** We provide persistent knowledge graphs, lineage/provenance, and policy‑guarded collaboration.
- **Against SIEM/observability stacks:** We bridge unstructured OSINT + structured telemetry via connectors and graph‑native reasoning.

**Three Pillars**
1. **Explainable GraphRAG** – retrieval grounded in graph topology + evidence provenance.
2. **Agentic Runbooks** – codified investigation flows that operate on entities/relationships with auditable steps.
3. **Zero‑Trust Collaboration** – ABAC + differential privacy (DP) to share insights with least privilege.
