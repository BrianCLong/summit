# Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategies

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the strategies for achieving zero-downtime deployments for IntelGraph microservices, ensuring continuous availability and a seamless user experience during updates.

## 2. Blue/Green Deployments

*   **Strategy**: Maintain two identical production environments, "Blue" (current live version) and "Green" (new version). Traffic is switched from Blue to Green once the Green environment is fully validated.
*   **Use Cases**: Major version upgrades, significant architectural changes.
*   **Advantages**: Simple rollback (switch traffic back to Blue), minimal downtime.
*   **Disadvantages**: Doubles infrastructure cost during deployment.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Provision Green environment with new service versions.
    *   Run comprehensive tests against Green.
    *   Update load balancer/ingress to route traffic to Green.
    *   Monitor Green environment closely.
    *   Decommission Blue environment after a stabilization period.

## 3. Canary Deployments

*   **Strategy**: Gradually roll out a new version of a service to a small subset of users, monitor its performance and stability, and then progressively increase the traffic to the new version.
*   **Use Cases**: Minor feature releases, bug fixes, A/B testing.
*   **Advantages**: Reduced risk (impact limited to a small user group), early detection of issues.
*   **Disadvantages**: More complex to manage, requires robust monitoring.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Deploy new version alongside the old.
    *   Route a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 5%) to the new version.
    *   Monitor key metrics (errors, latency, user feedback).
    *   Gradually increase traffic to the new version if stable.
    *   Fully switch traffic and decommission old version.

## 4. Automated Rollback Triggers

*   **Strategy**: Automatically trigger a rollback to the previous stable version if predefined SLOs (Service Level Objectives) are violated during a deployment.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics collection and visualization.
    *   **Alerting**: Configure Prometheus Alertmanager to trigger alerts based on SLO violations (e.g., increased error rates, latency spikes).
    *   **Rollback Mechanism**: CI/CD pipeline integrates with Kubernetes (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux) to automatically revert to the previous Helm release or Kubernetes deployment.

## 5. Staging Soak Tests

*   **Strategy**: Before promoting a release to production, run extended soak tests in the staging environment to identify performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and other long-running issues.
*   **Duration**: Typically 24-72 hours, simulating realistic production load.
*   **Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, network, disk I/O, latency, error rates, and application-specific metrics.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Deploy release candidate to staging.
    *   Apply synthetic load using k6 or similar tools.
    *   Monitor metrics and logs for anomalies.
    *   Only promote to production if soak tests pass without critical issues.
