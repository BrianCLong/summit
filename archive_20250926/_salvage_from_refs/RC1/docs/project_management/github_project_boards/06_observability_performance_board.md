# Project Board: Observability & Performance

## To Do

*   **Story:** As a platform operator, I want to be able to monitor the health and performance of the platform in real-time.
    *   **Task:** Set up a monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A monitoring stack is set up with Prometheus and Grafana. The stack is configured to monitor all services in the platform.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Create dashboards for monitoring key system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space).
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Dashboards are created for monitoring key system metrics. The dashboards are easy to understand and provide a clear overview of the platform's health.
        *   **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Set up alerting for critical issues.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Alerting is set up for critical issues. The alerts are sent to the appropriate channels (e.g., email, Slack).
        *   **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
*   **Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to easily debug issues in the platform.
    *   **Task:** Implement structured logging throughout the platform.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Structured logging is implemented throughout the platform. The logs are easy to search and filter.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Integrate with a distributed tracing system like Jaeger or Zipkin.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The platform is integrated with a distributed tracing system. The traces provide a clear overview of the request flow through the platform.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
*   **Story:** As a user, I want the platform to be fast and responsive.
    *   **Task:** Identify and optimize slow-running queries.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Slow-running queries are identified and optimized. The performance of the platform is improved.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Caching is implemented for frequently accessed data. The cache is configured to provide the best performance without sacrificing data consistency.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Use a content delivery network (CDN) to improve frontend performance.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A CDN is used to improve frontend performance. The CDN is configured to cache static assets and serve them from a location close to the user.
        *   **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
