# Change Management Plan

This document outlines the plan for adopting the new project management processes for the IntelGraph project.

## Introduction

We are introducing a new set of project management processes to help us work more effectively and efficiently. These processes are based on a sprint-based development methodology and are designed to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of our goals, progress, and processes.

## Goals

The goals of these new processes are to:

*   Improve our ability to plan and execute our work.
*   Increase transparency and visibility into our progress.
*   Foster a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
*   Make it easier for new contributors to get involved in the project.

## Rollout Plan

The new project management processes will be rolled out over the next few weeks. The following is a high-level overview of the rollout plan:

*   **Week 1:** Introduce the new project management processes to the team. Review the new documentation and answer any questions.
*   **Week 2:** Start using the new sprint planning process. Hold the first sprint planning meeting and create the first sprint backlog.
*   **Week 3:** Start using the new daily standup process. Hold daily standup meetings to discuss progress and any blockers.
*   **Week 4:** Hold the first sprint review and retrospective meetings. Demonstrate the work that has been completed and discuss what can be improved for the next sprint.

## Training

We will provide training and support to help the team adopt the new project management processes. This will include:

*   A walkthrough of the new documentation.
*   A Q&A session to answer any questions.
*   Ongoing support from the project lead and tech lead.

## Feedback

We welcome feedback on the new project management processes. Please feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions in the #intelgraph-dev channel on Slack.
