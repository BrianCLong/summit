## Development Process

We use a sprint-based development process to manage our work. Each sprint is two weeks long and focuses on a small set of high-priority tasks. We use GitHub project boards to track the progress of our work.

### Sprint Planning

At the beginning of each sprint, we hold a sprint planning meeting to decide which tasks to work on. We use the `02_sprint_plan.md` document as a starting point for this process.

### Daily Standups

We hold daily standup meetings to discuss our progress and any blockers we are facing.

### Sprint Review

At the end of each sprint, we hold a sprint review meeting to demonstrate the work we have completed.

### Sprint Retrospective

We also hold a sprint retrospective meeting to discuss what went well during the sprint and what we can improve for the next sprint.
