## ✅ Production Readiness Checklist

### 🏗️ Core Infrastructure
- [x] **Orchestrator deployed**: Maestro/Conductor running with 2+ replicas, HA setup ✅
- [x] **Persistence layer**: PostgreSQL + Redis cluster with monitoring ✅  
- [x] **RBAC configured**: Service accounts, roles, network policies ✅
- [x] **Ingress setup**: TLS certificates, load balancing, security headers ✅

### 👷 Worker Fleet
- [x] **Worker containers**: Build, test, security workers packaged ✅
- [x] **Auto-scaling**: HPA rules on CPU, memory, and queue depth ✅
- [x] **Circuit breakers**: Resilience patterns implemented ✅
- [x] **Pod disruption budgets**: High availability guaranteed ✅

### 🔐 Security & Secrets
- [x] **Secret management**: Kubernetes secrets, rotation policies ✅
- [x] **Pre-commit hooks**: Multi-layer secret detection (detect-secrets, TruffleHog, GitLeaks) ✅
- [x] **Container scanning**: Trivy, SBOM generation, image signing with Cosign ✅
- [x] **Network policies**: Namespace isolation, ingress/egress rules ✅

### 📊 Observability
- [x] **OpenTelemetry**: Traces configured across all services ✅
- [x] **Prometheus metrics**: Custom metrics for workflows, tasks, queues ✅
- [x] **Grafana dashboard**: Real-time monitoring (workflows/sec, latency, failure rates) ✅
- [x] **Structured logging**: JSON logs with trace correlation ✅

### 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] **Golden pipeline**: PR checks → build → sign → deploy → smoke tests ✅
- [x] **Environment promotion**: dev → UAT → prod with gates ✅
- [x] **SBOM & signing**: Software bill of materials, Cosign attestation ✅
- [x] **Quality gates**: Tests, linting, security scans must pass ✅

### 🛡️ Deployment Safety
- [ ] **Canary deployments**: 10% → 100% traffic routing
- [ ] **Blue-green prod**: Zero-downtime production deployments  
- [ ] **Automatic rollback**: SLO breach triggers instant rollback
- [ ] **Database migrations**: Pre-check and post-verify automation

### 📋 Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Hello-World workflow**: Basic orchestrator health proof
- [ ] **Hello-Case workflow**: End-to-end IntelGraph value loop
- [ ] **Smoke tests**: Automated post-deployment validation
- [ ] **Load testing**: Performance validation under stress

### 🚨 Alerting & SLOs
- [ ] **SLO definitions**: p95 completion times, failure thresholds
- [ ] **Alert routing**: PagerDuty integration, escalation policies
- [ ] **Runbooks**: One-click remediation procedures
- [ ] **Incident response**: Automated triage and recovery

### 🌊 Preview Environments
- [ ] **PR previews**: Namespace-scoped ephemeral environments
- [ ] **Auto-cleanup**: TTL policies for preview environments
- [ ] **Artifact linking**: Preview URLs on GitHub PRs
- [ ] **Resource limits**: Prevent preview environment resource exhaustion

## 📈 Key Metrics Dashboard

The Grafana dashboard tracks:
- **Workflow execution rate** (workflows/sec)
- **Task latency** (p50, p95, p99) 
- **Dead letter queue size** (error indicator)
- **Success vs failure rates** (reliability indicator)
- **Worker poll rates** (throughput indicator)
- **Database connection pools** (resource health)
- **Redis performance** (cache hit/miss ratios)
- **JVM memory usage** (application health)
