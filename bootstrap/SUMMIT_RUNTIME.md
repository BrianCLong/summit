# Summit Runtime & Dev Environment

## Required

- Node or Python (depending on final runner)
- Makefile or CLI wrappers
- GitHub access for PR actions
- VSCode + recommended extensions

## Setup Steps

1. Clone repo
2. Run `summit init`
3. Verify:
   - agent registry loads
   - governance passes validation
   - flows compile

## Dev Norms

- Create new features through flows
- Never bypass agents directly
- All code changes must go through Jules or Codex
- All PRs must go through Reviewer
