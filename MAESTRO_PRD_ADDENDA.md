### Fast‑Track (Auto‑Promotion) Criteria

1. All SLOs green at slice boundary
2. Provenance manifest attached (disclosure pack minimum)
3. OPA policy simulation pass (no denies)
4. Cost/budget within guardrails

**Outcome**: CI emits `fastlane.ok` and sets trace attr `maestro.fastlane=true`; next agent task is auto‑scheduled.
