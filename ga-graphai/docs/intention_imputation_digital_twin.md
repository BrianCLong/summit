# Intention Imputation Digital Twin Tool

## Summary

This document formalizes a production-grade capability that infers multi-step actor intentions by orchestrating digital twins, provenance capture, and N-step plan synthesis inside the GraphAI ecosystem. The tool empowers operators to forecast, explain, and audit probable action trajectories before they manifest in live systems, while enforcing the governance, reliability, and security expectations of enterprise deployments.

## Objectives

- **Impute Intentions**: Estimate the likely goals and sub-goals behind observed telemetry or prompts by running hypothetical trajectories across digital twins enriched with historical priors.
- **N-Step Forecasting**: Produce branching plans up to N steps ahead, highlighting decision points, confidence scores, required resources, and mitigation leverage points.
- **Provenance Traceability**: Generate an auditable provenance ledger for each simulated run so downstream reviewers can validate assumptions, datasets, and model versions used.
- **Operator Tooling**: Deliver analyst-facing overlays and APIs that surface intention hypotheses, supporting evidence, recommended mitigations, and explainability artifacts.
- **Operational Resilience**: Ensure the service meets explicit SLAs/SLOs, supports disaster recovery, and exposes observability hooks for continuous monitoring.

## Core Components

1. **Observation Collector**
   - Ingests structured telemetry (GraphAI overlays, edge events) and unstructured cues (LLM transcripts, incident tickets, analyst annotations).
   - Normalizes artifacts into the common `Observation` schema with timestamps, actor identifiers, provenance references, and sensitivity tags.
   - Applies pre-ingestion policy filters (PII scrubbing, mission-scoped routing) before forwarding to downstream services.

2. **Goal Hypothesizer**
   - Uses Bayesian goal recognition combined with retrieval-augmented generation over past missions and counterfactual datasets.
   - Outputs weighted candidate intentions with supporting precedent cases from the Provenance Ledger.
   - Supports configurable priors (mission templates, actor ontologies) and allows analyst overrides with tracked justification.

3. **Digital Twin Orchestrator**
   - Spins up domain-specific twins (e.g., supply-chain, comms, policy workflows) using the workcell runtime and deterministic seed management for replay.
   - Applies candidate goals and constraints to produce branching execution trees up to depth N with adaptive heuristics per domain.
   - Captures state deltas, risk scores, resource consumption, and confidence deltas for each branch while enforcing safety rails.

4. **Provenance Ledger Writer**
   - Records every simulation run, including model versions, prompt templates, datasets, and parameter hashes within Merkle-linked attestations.
   - Links ledger entries back to Observation IDs, twin state snapshots, and analyst decisions for full auditability.
   - Emits signed SBOM artifacts for downstream compliance tooling.

5. **Analyst Overlay & API**
   - Visualizes intention trajectories on the Investigations overlay with filters for confidence, risk, time horizon, and governance status.
   - Provides GraphQL and event-stream endpoints for programmatic consumption by policy automation or alerting pipelines.
   - Surfaces explainability snippets (key features, turning points, alternative hypotheses) and integrates human-in-the-loop feedback capture.

## Reference Architecture

1. **Ingestion Tier** → **Observation Collector** (Kafka consumers, webhook adapters).
2. **Hypothesis Tier** → **Goal Hypothesizer** (LLM/RAG services, Bayesian scorer, policy guardrails).
3. **Simulation Tier** → **Digital Twin Orchestrator** (workcell runtime, scenario registry, compute autoscaling).
4. **Ledger Tier** → **Provenance Ledger Writer** (prov-ledger package, artifact signer, retention manager).
5. **Delivery Tier** → **Analyst Overlay & API** (GraphQL gateway, event streams, UI overlays, automation webhooks).

A Zero-Trust mesh connects the tiers. Each boundary enforces mutual TLS, per-mission authorization, and event-level provenance tagging. High-level data flow:

| 1 | Observation Collector | Goal Hypothesizer | `Observation` | JSON schema, includes source, sensitivity, policy tags |
| 2 | Goal Hypothesizer | Twin Orchestrator | `IntentHypothesisBatch` | Ranked list with priors, time horizon, guardrail metadata |
| 3 | Twin Orchestrator | Provenance Ledger Writer | `TwinScenarioRun` | Branch tree, metrics, per-branch evidence references |
| 4 | Ledger Writer | Analyst Overlay | `ProvenanceBundle` | Ledger entry IDs, SBOM signature, compliance classification |
| 5 | Overlay | External Consumers | `IntentionAdvisory` | GraphQL types, includes recommended mitigations and audit link |

### Deployment Topology
