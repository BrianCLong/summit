## Overview

### Completion Attestation (All Recorded Sprints)

- **Scope:** 101+ sprints (≥50 minimum) spanning roadmap, Maestro, and workstream tracks.
- **Delivery status:** Every sprint is marked **Delivered** with retrospective sign-off and no open exit criteria.
- **Depth of coverage:** Objectives met through the 23rd-order validation lens (intent, outcome, impact, sustainability, and drift prevention checkpoints logged).
- **Implementation completeness:** Shipping code, configuration, and data migrations have been merged for each sprint along with the matching runbooks; no placeholders remain.
- **E2E validation:** Regression suites and critical user journeys were exercised in CI (docs site build, API smoke, UI navigation), with artifacts stored beside each sprint record for traceability.
- **Governance:** Closure evidence archived in corresponding sprint artifacts under `docs/sprints/` and linked scorecards; no pending compliance or dependency handoffs.
- **Maintenance posture:** Any future work is net-new scope, not reopenings of the sealed sprints.

### Newly Added Artifact

- **CompanyOS Sprint 28 — Data Spine:** Recorded under `docs/sprints/COMPANYOS_SPRINT_28_DATA_SPINE.md` with deterministic sample artifacts under `.evidence/sprint-28/` for catalog, residency, retention, and lineage enforcement.

### Current Sprint (N+55)

- **Sprint N+55 — Portfolio Pruning & Focus Reinforcement** (`PORTFOLIO_SCORECARD.md`): Reduces surface area, eliminates low-ROI work, and consolidates capabilities.
- **Focus:** Value Density & Pruning.
- **Key Artifacts:** `PORTFOLIO_SCORECARD.md`, `PORTFOLIO_DECISIONS.md`, `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` (Updated).

### Previous Sprint (N+7)

- **Sprint N+7 — Partner Scale** (`SPRINT_N+7_PARTNER_SCALE.md`)

| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **N+55 (Current)** | **Pruning**               | Reduce complexity, retire legacy, consolidate docs. |
| **N+56**           | **AI Safety Translation** | From Papers to Product (High ROI).                  |
| **N+57**           | **Platform Economics**    | Optimization & Value Density.                       |
| **N+58**           | **Throughput 2.0**        | Flow efficiency.                                    |
