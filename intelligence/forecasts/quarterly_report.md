# Quarterly Regulatory Forecast

## Executive Summary
Competitors are heavily investing in capturing the AI Act process. This creates a rigidity trap. We anticipate they will be locked into v1 compliance while we adapt to v2.

## Key Signals
*   Signal A: Competitor X lobbying for specific clause 12.
*   Signal B: EU Commission indicating pivot to output-based metrics.
