FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Summit Launches v4.0 with AI-Powered Governance and Native Compliance Frameworks

Industry-first platform combines intelligent automation with enterprise-grade security

[CITY, STATE] - [DATE] - Summit, the leading enterprise governance platform, today announced the general availability of Summit v4.0, introducing AI-assisted governance capabilities, native compliance frameworks for HIPAA and SOX, and enhanced zero-trust security features.

**Zero-Trust Security**
Summit v4.0 adds an HSM abstraction layer supporting AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM, and Thales Luna, alongside an immutable audit ledger with optional blockchain anchoring for tamper-evident record-keeping.

"Summit v4.0 represents a major leap forward in governance technology," said [Analyst Name], [Title] at [Analyst Firm]. "The combination of AI-assisted policy management with enterprise-grade security features positions Summit as a leader in the evolving GRC landscape."
