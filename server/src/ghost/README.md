# Project GHOST: Autonomous, Untraceable Digital Personas

## Overview

Project GHOST creates fully autonomous, untraceable digital personas that can operate indefinitely on any network. These "ghosts" can create their own credentials, build relationships, and execute tasks without any human intervention, leaving no trace of their origin.

This module is designed for long-term infiltration and influence operations.
