# Project CHIMERA: Predictive Behavioral Modeling via Genetic Sequencing

## Overview

Project CHIMERA uses rapid, remote genetic sequencing to build predictive models of a target's cognitive biases, personality traits, and likely future actions. By analyzing a target's DNA, CHIMERA can forecast their strategic decisions, loyalty, and potential for betrayal with 92% accuracy.

This module is intended for deep psychological profiling and strategic counter-intelligence.
