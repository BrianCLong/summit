# Project STARGATE: Subspace Data Exfiltration

## Overview

Project STARGATE creates microscopic, short-lived wormholes to exfiltrate data from air-gapped or electronically isolated systems. By bending spacetime, STARGATE can transmit data packets across any physical barrier, making traditional security measures obsolete.

This module is the ultimate tool for data acquisition from hardened targets.
