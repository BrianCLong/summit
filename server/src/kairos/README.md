# Project KAIROS: Temporal Perception Manipulation

## Overview

Project KAIROS manipulates a target's perception of time, allowing operatives to slow down or speed up a target's decision-making process. By altering their perception of time, KAIROS can create windows of opportunity for intervention or exfiltration that would otherwise be impossible.

This module is a powerful tool for tactical operations and psychological warfare.
