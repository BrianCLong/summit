# Project ECHELON-2: Global Passive DNA Sniffing Grid

## Overview

Project ECHELON-2 is a simulated system for a global, passive environmental DNA (eDNA) collection and analysis grid. It models a network of classified collectors that continuously sample airborne eDNA. These samples are then processed in real-time to match against a database of target genomes, allowing for the passive, real-time tracking of High-Value Targets (HVTs) anywhere in the world.

When a match is found, the system generates a `PhysicalPresenceConfirmation`, which auto-tags the corresponding entity in the IntelGraph with "Physical Presence Confirmed."

**Note:** This is a conceptual simulation and does not process real genomic data.

## Core Concepts

-   **eDNA Reading:** Represents a raw data sample from a collector node in the grid. It includes the location, timestamp, and a simplified list of collected DNA sequences.
-   **Genome Signature:** A unique genomic marker that identifies a specific HVT. The system maintains a database of these signatures for matching.
-   **Physical Presence Confirmation:** The primary output of the system. This is a high-confidence record confirming that a specific target was at a precise location at a specific time, based on a positive eDNA match.

## API Endpoints

-   `POST /api/echelon2/ingest`: Submits a new `eDNAReading` from a collector into the processing pipeline. The system attempts to match the DNA sequences in the reading against its target database.
    -   If a match is found, it returns `201 Created` with the new `PhysicalPresenceConfirmation` object.
    -   If no match is found, it returns `200 OK` with a simple message.
-   `GET /api/echelon2/confirmations`: Retrieves a list of all physical presence confirmations generated by the system.
-   `GET /api/echelon2/confirmations/{targetId}`: Retrieves all historical presence confirmations for a single, specified target.

## Workflow

1.  **Ingest Data:** A collector (or a simulation of one) sends a `POST` request with an `eDNAReading` payload to the `/api/echelon2/ingest` endpoint.
2.  **Check Response:** The system processes the sample. A `201` response indicates a successful track. A `200` response indicates no match was found.
3.  **Query Tracks:** Use the `GET` endpoints to retrieve historical tracking data for all targets or a specific HVT.
