# Pipeline Optimization Patterns

This guide documents the optimization strategies implemented in the advanced data pipeline optimizer. Each pattern is designed to improve throughput, resiliency, and observability without sacrificing correctness.

## 1. Concurrency-Aware Task Scheduling

- **What it does:** Builds a dependency graph, executes independent stages in parallel, and prevents starvation through a criticality-aware queue.
- **Implementation:** `PipelineOptimizer` topologically sorts tasks, then uses a `PriorityJobQueue` tuned to business criticality (`blocker`, `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `deferred`).
- **When to use:** Pipelines where independent transformations can run simultaneously (e.g., multi-tenant enrichment, fan-out/fan-in ETL jobs).
- **Key metrics:** `pipeline_tasks_active` gauge and latency histogram for per-task observability.

## 2. Intelligent Database Batching

- **What it does:** Adapts batch size using a sliding latency window to hit a defined SLO while maximizing throughput.
- **Implementation:** `AdaptiveBatcher` tracks the last 50 executions and models the latency slope, then shrinks or grows batches accordingly.
- **When to use:** High-volume insert/update flows where the optimal batch size drifts over time.
- **Key metrics:** Attach `context.plan_batch(pending)` before writes and `context.record_batch(size, latency)` afterwards.

## 3. Priority-Driven Job Queues

- **What it does:** Routes tasks through a heap that always schedules the most business-critical items first, falling back to FIFO for peers.
- **Implementation:** `PriorityJobQueue` maps semantic priority labels to numeric weights, ensuring critical backlog drains first.
- **When to use:** Blended workloads that mix SLA-sensitive and best-effort jobs.
- **Key metrics:** Monitor `critical_backlog` via the pipeline dashboard.

## 4. Streaming to Control Memory Footprint

- **What it does:** Breaks large datasets into deterministic chunks to keep resident memory flat.
- **Implementation:** `stream_iterable` and `stream_dataframe` yield batches lazily for Python iterables and Pandas DataFrames.
- **When to use:** Ingestion of multi-GB extracts, incremental ML feature pushes, or any workload exceeding in-memory budgets.
- **Key metrics:** Track chunk counts per task via `context.record_custom_metric` if needed.

## 5. Circuit Breakers & Intelligent Retries

- **What it does:** Trips a breaker after repeated downstream failures and retries with exponential backoff (jitter included) to avoid thundering herds.
- **Implementation:** `CircuitBreaker` + `retry_with_backoff`; integrate per-task through `PipelineTask.retry_policy` and `PipelineTask.circuit_breaker`.
- **When to use:** Downstream services with variable stability (e.g., partner APIs, analytics warehouses).
- **Key metrics:** `pipeline_task_failures_total` and `pipeline_task_retries_total` counters.

## 6. Real-time Health Dashboard

- **What it does:** Provides a zero-dependency (aside from `aiohttp`/Prometheus client) dashboard for live task telemetry.
- **Implementation:** `PipelineDashboard` renders HTML refreshed every second and exposes `/metrics` JSON + `/prometheus` scraping endpoints.
- **When to use:** Operations centers that need immediate feedback on pipeline health without requiring a full Grafana deployment.
- **Key metrics:** `throughput_per_minute`, `avg_latency_ms`, and timestamp of last update.

## 7. Benchmark-Driven Validation

- **What it does:** Guarantees measurable gains; default benchmark demonstrates 40%+ runtime improvement over single-threaded execution.
- **Implementation:** `BenchmarkSuite` runs synthetic workloads in sequential mode (`max_workers=1`) and optimized mode (`max_workers>1`).
- **When to use:** Performance regression testing, capacity planning, or to baseline pipeline tuning before production rollout.
- **Key metrics:** Improvement percentage â‰¥ 40% recorded in `pipeline_optimizer_benchmarks.json`.

## Operational Checklist

1. **Model tasks** with accurate dependency and criticality data.
2. **Attach retry policies** for unstable systems; set breakers for strict SLAs.
3. **Batch database writes** through the shared execution context.
4. **Stream heavy payloads** to prevent memory spikes.
5. **Monitor metrics** via `/metrics` or integrate Prometheus scraping.
6. **Run benchmarks** before and after major changes to validate gains.

Following these patterns yields resilient, performant pipelines ready for enterprise-scale workloads.
