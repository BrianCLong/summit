# Strategic Update: Agentic Infrastructure (Q1 2026)

**Summary:**
Based on the latest Q1 2026 market signal, Summit is pivoting to treat "Agentic AI" as core infrastructure. This roadmap implements "Agents as Services," neutral orchestration, and governance-first auto-judging.

**Key Changes:**
1.  **Maestro:** Evolving into a neutral "Agent Control Plane" supporting multi-agent teams and diverse provider backends.
2.  **IntelGraph:** Productizing a "Deep Research Agent" for autonomous OSINT investigations with self-verification loops.
3.  **Governance:** Introducing "Auto-Judging" hooks (Project Koshchei) to attach confidence scores and policy checks to every agent output.
4.  **Standards:** Adopting a "Summit Agent ABI" (compatible with MCP) to standardize agent-to-agent communication.

**Artifacts:**
*   [Strategic Roadmap (60-90 Day)](docs/roadmap/strategic/2026_AGENTIC_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
*   [Summit Agent Protocol Spec (Draft)](docs/specs/SUMMIT_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md)

**Action Plan (Next 30 Days):**
*   [ ] Implement `Maestro Dashboard` for live agent observability.
*   [ ] Prototype `ResearchAgent` in IntelGraph.
*   [ ] Define `AgentManifest` schema in Maestro Core.
*   [ ] Ship "Auto-Judge" middleware for governance.
