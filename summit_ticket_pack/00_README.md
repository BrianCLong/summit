# Summit Ticket Pack (Generated)
**Generated:** 2025-09-10 06:46:08Z UTC

This pack contains runnable CI workflows, security scans, IaC checks, policy templates, and a prioritized ticket backlog.
Copy files into your repo root (merging with `.github/` and `docs/`) then open the tickets to drive execution.

**Highlights**
- Code & dependency gates (lint, typecheck, tests, coverage)
- SBOM + vuln scanning (Syft/Grype/Trivy) via Docker
- Terraform validation & lint (validate/tflint/checkov)
- K8s policy & hygiene (kube-linter/kube-score/Polaris), OPA Gatekeeper baseline
- Secret hygiene (git-secrets, TruffleHog), SOPS + age
- Release automation (Release Drafter), Dependabot, CODEOWNERS
- Security posture docs (SECURITY.md), contributing guide, issue templates

Integrate progressively if enabling all at once is too noisy.
