"Prior Art","Experiment Representation","Curriculum Formalization","Delta (Our Novelty)"
"AutoML (e.g., Google AutoML, H2O.ai)","Hyperparameter search space; pipeline graph","Implicit or non-existent; typically greedy or exhaustive search","Lacks explicit, staged curriculum and LLM-driven hypothesis generation in a rich graph."
"ML Experiment Tracking (e.g., W&B, MLflow)","Runs, experiments, artifacts (flat or loosely grouped)","None; they are passive tracking tools, not schedulers","Does not propose or schedule experiments; purely a system of record."
"LLM-based Agents (e.g., AutoGPT, BabyAGI)","Task list or vector memory","Implicit through prompting and goal decomposition","State representation is not a formal experiment graph; no concept of a scientific curriculum."
"AutoRL / Population-Based Training","Policy parameters, environment configurations","Implicit through fitness functions and population dynamics","Curriculum is emergent, not declarative. Graph representation is not used for planning."
"RLHF Frameworks (e.g., TRIL, RLax)","Model weights, preference data, reward model state","Often manual or based on simple heuristics (e.g., task difficulty)","Lacks a generalized graph to represent diverse experiments beyond reward modeling."
