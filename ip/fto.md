# Freedom-to-Operate Notes: Summit SDK

## Domain

Graph-native, policy-aware SDK for LLM applications including RAG, tools, governance, and telemetry.

## Observations

- Most open-source agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex) focus on chains, not governance-first graphs; our policy-first graphs provide differentiation.
- Governance/telemetry coupling with per-tenant overlays appears under-served; monitor for patents around policy-enforced agent execution.
- Tool schema derivation from type hints is common; ensure unique graph+policy integration is emphasized in filings.

## Mitigations

- Maintain modular transport layer to avoid infringement on provider-specific SDKs.
- Use explicit capability flags to remain compatible with multiple model providers.
- Document governance ledger integration and graph compilation as distinguishing features.

## New Wedge Notes

### ANFIS (Coordination Fingerprinting + Counterfactuals)

- Monitor patents covering coordinated inauthentic behavior detection (e.g., clustering + timing); emphasize multi-signal fingerprints plus simulated interventions and replay tokens.
- Ensure link-laundering detection is grounded in redirection chain analysis to differentiate from basic URL expansion tools.

### ILC-PWD (Lifecycle Compiler)

- Watch for lifecycle scoring frameworks; highlight provenance-weighted decay with class-specific parameters and minimal support proofs.
- Keep counterfactual remediation impacts behind policy gates to avoid overlap with generic risk simulators.

### OAEAC (Ontology ABI)

- Prior art on schema-driven APIs is dense; stress action contracts with pre/post predicates, effect signatures, and witnessed execution as differentiators.
- Trusted execution and hash-chained witness ledgers further distance from conventional API gateways.

### ITD-OIP (Investigation Plan Optimizer)

- Investigative playbooks exist; maintain novelty through automated trace lowering, optimization (dedupe/batching/join reorder), and per-step witness chains.
- Jurisdictional and license checks per plan step provide additional separation from generic ETL optimizers.

### FOPB-LG (Federated OSINT Governance)

- OSINT scanners are prevalent; anchor claims in passive-first defaults, privacy budgets per target, and signed scan capsules with replay tokens.
- Transparency log anchoring and tenant-salted commitments mitigate correlation risks and align with governance requirements.
