# Freedom-to-Operate Notes: Summit SDK

## Domain

Graph-native, policy-aware SDK for LLM applications including RAG, tools, governance, and telemetry.

## Observations

- Most open-source agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex) focus on chains, not governance-first graphs; our policy-first graphs provide differentiation.
- Governance/telemetry coupling with per-tenant overlays appears under-served; monitor for patents around policy-enforced agent execution.
- Tool schema derivation from type hints is common; ensure unique graph+policy integration is emphasized in filings.

## Mitigations

- Maintain modular transport layer to avoid infringement on provider-specific SDKs.
- Use explicit capability flags to remain compatible with multiple model providers.
- Document governance ledger integration and graph compilation as distinguishing features.

## Wedge-Specific Freedom-to-Operate Notes

### ANFIS

- Focus on hybrid graph/neural ranking with compliance-grade provenance. [CITATION PLACEHOLDER]
- Monitor patents on explainable recommender systems that blend causal graphs with embeddings.

### ILC-PWD

- Avoid overlap with adaptive GPU schedulers by emphasizing policy-aware, carbon-informed placement. [CITATION PLACEHOLDER]
- Document isolation controls and rollback chains unique to combined training/inference orchestration.

### OAEAC

- Distinguish from SIEM correlation by grounding responses in policy graph actions and staged rollouts. [CITATION PLACEHOLDER]
- Capture explainability vectors and audit anchoring as differentiators.

### ITD-OIP

- Differentiate from narrative generators by tying attack reconstructions to sandbox replay metrics. [CITATION PLACEHOLDER]
- Maintain clear mappings to governance reporting to avoid broad incident-response claims.

### FOPB-LG

- Highlight tenant-scoped privacy budgeting and federated routing with carbon-aware optimization. [CITATION PLACEHOLDER]
- Ensure differential privacy handling is explicitly documented to avoid collision with generic federated learning patents.
