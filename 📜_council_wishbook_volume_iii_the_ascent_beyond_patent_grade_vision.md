# 📜 Council Feature & Use‑Case Wishbook — **Volume III: The Ascent Beyond**

_Issued by the Council of Spies & Strategists, under the chairmanship of Markus Wolf. This Volume assumes I (Foundational) and II (Summit Edition) are implemented. **No repetition.** Focus: decisive superiority over competitors via **novel, defensible, patent‑grade IP** that advances verifiable intelligence, lawful autonomy, and federated operations._

---

## I) Executive Thesis — “As Above, So Below”

Volume III converts our platform into a **self‑verifying strategic organism**: models that prove their own limits, simulations that confess their uncertainty, and collaborations that **exchange trust, not data**. We move from auditable autonomy (Vol II) to **provable strategy**: every prediction, plan, and policy is paired with a machine‑checkable warrant or a quantified ignorance certificate.

**North‑Stars**

- **From Proof‑Carrying Results → Proof‑Carrying Reality**: Attach proofs not just to analytics, but to _forecasts, interventions, and non‑actions_.
- **No‑Copy Alliance at Planet Scale**: Trust exchange over claims, counterfactuals, and sealed policies without raw data movement.
- **Human‑First Control**: Dissent, ombuds, and risk budgets are cryptographically enforced, not merely recorded.

---

## II) Frontier Capability Pillars (All‑New)

### A) Provable Strategy & Reasoning

- **A1. Counterfactual Proof Cartridges (CPC)**  
  _Claim_: A packaging format where each forecast or COA includes a compact **counterfactual proof sketch** (SAT/SMT‑backed) stating which assumptions drive the outcome and what must change to flip it.  
  _IP Hook_: Composable CPC graphs; minimal‑explanation extraction with bounded regret guarantees.  
  _Why_: Turns “black‑box what‑ifs” into **auditable levers**.

- **A2. Policy‑Sealed Computation (PSC)**  
  _Claim_: Executions occur inside confidential enclaves whose **inputs/outputs are functionally encrypted** to an explicit, signed policy; violations are mathematically impossible.  
  _IP Hook_: Hybrid FE+TEE+ZK protocol for post‑hoc verifiability without revealing plaintext.  
  _Why_: Share _capability_ without sharing data.

- **A3. Proof‑of‑Non‑Collection (PNC)**  
  _Claim_: A cryptographic attestation that a query/agent **did not** touch disallowed fields/tenants/selectors, with differential‑privacy‑aware leakage bounds.  
  _IP Hook_: Negative‑evidence commitments via Merkle exclusions + range proofs.  
  _Why_: Regulators, journalists, and partners demand more than “trust us.”

- **A4. Dialectic Co‑Agents with Quantified Coverage (DCQ)**  
  _Claim_: Paired adversarial reasoners generate _arguments + counter‑arguments_ until **coverage and novelty metrics** converge; emits a **Decision Debate Record (DDR)**.  
  _IP Hook_: Surprise/coverage meters with PAC‑style stopping rules.  
  _Why_: Replace single‑narrative failure with bounded, plural analysis.

### B) Federated Leverage 2.0 (No‑Copy, No‑Leak)

- **B1. Zero‑Knowledge Early‑Warning Exchange (ZKEWX)**  
  _Claim_: Partners share **anomaly claims** (not data) with tunable sensitivity and **false‑positive insurance**; cross‑validate via ZK set/range/correlation proofs.  
  _IP Hook_: Multi‑party, multi‑moment ZK correlation without raw joins.  
  _Why_: Detect cascades (finance, supply chain, info ops) without violating sovereignty.

- **B2. Semantic Delta Networks (SDN)**  
  _Claim_: Ultra‑low‑bandwidth **knowledge sync** that transmits only **meaningful deltas** (graph motif changes, causality flips) rather than documents/rows.  
  _IP Hook_: Semantic differencing with canonicalization + causal fingerprints.  
  _Why_: Edge/contested environments; faster consensus, smaller attack surface.

- **B3. Liaison Covenants & Revocation Oracles (LCRO)**  
  _Claim_: Time‑boxed **trust covenants** with programmable revocation; derived outputs auto‑expire unless re‑attested.  
  _IP Hook_: Oracular revocation with downstream dependency tracing.  
  _Why_: Enforce purpose limitation across alliances in reality, not policy slides.

### C) Model Integrity & On‑Device Intelligence

- **C1. Introspective Weight Surgery (IWS)**  
  _Claim_: Live **hot‑patching** of model sub‑modules guided by **mechanistic probes** + safety proofs; emits a **Surgery Receipt** for audit/replay.  
  _IP Hook_: Subspace edits with bounded‑impact certificates.  
  _Why_: Fix failure modes hours—not months—without retraining from scratch.

- **C2. Generative Watermarks with Dual Entropy (GW‑DE)**  
  _Claim_: Output watermarks combine **content‑defined and model‑state randomness**, resisting removal and cross‑model laundering.  
  _IP Hook_: Two‑source extractor + detection with low false positives across compressions.  
  _Why_: Authenticity that survives adversarial transformations.

- **C3. Proof‑Carrying Edge (PCE)**  
  _Claim_: Edge agents emit compact **execution proofs** (STARK‑style) for **offline** verification by HQ; sync as SDN deltas.  
  _IP Hook_: Sliding‑window proofs with CRDT integration.  
  _Why_: Denied/air‑gapped ops with trust on reconnection.

### D) Counter‑Deception & Narrative Physics

- **D1. Narrative Field Theory (NFT‑x)**  
  _Claim_: Treats information space as a **field**; measures gradients, sinks, and conserved quantities for stories across time/media/language.  
  _IP Hook_: Gauge‑like invariants that travel across modalities; robust to paraphrase and synthetic noise.  
  _Why_: Forecasts spread and decay; suggests **minimal interventions**.

- **D2. Honey‑Pattern Weave (HPW)**  
  _Claim_: A generator of **safe, ethical decoy motifs** across data/products/community signals to map adversary collection **without harm**.  
  _IP Hook_: Multi‑modal canary codes with reversible provenance threads.  
  _Why_: Attribute hostile collectors and protect real assets.

- **D3. Counterfactual Risk Budgeting (CRB)**  
  _Claim_: Every intervention spends a **risk budget** priced by counterfactual harm simulations; budgets are codified in PSC and enforced.  
  _IP Hook_: Lagrangian governance—optimize utility subject to live harm constraints.  
  _Why_: Ethical action as a **first‑class optimizer**.

### E) Human‑Systems, Governance, and Law

- **E1. Cryptographic Dissent Commitments (CDC)**  
  _Claim_: Dissenters can **commit** objections (time‑stamped, sealed), later revealing without retaliation risk; policies must prove they accounted for dissent.  
  _IP Hook_: Non‑repudiable dissent channels with quorum triggers.  
  _Why_: Protects conscience, captures institutional memory.

- **E2. Ombuds Autonomy Controller (OAC)**  
  _Claim_: Ombuds define **hard constraints** (population risk caps, protected selectors) that are compiled into PSC; agents **cannot** breach.  
  _IP Hook_: Ombuds‑to‑bytecode pipeline with attested deployment.  
  _Why_: Trustworthy autonomy under human law.

- **E3. Proof‑of‑Purpose (PoP) & Use‑Decay**  
  _Claim_: Every dataset/claim carries **purpose tags** with **use‑decay** timestamps; expired purpose auto‑locks exports and triggers revocation via LCRO.  
  _IP Hook_: Purpose clock + decay calculus with exception proofs.  
  _Why_: Dynamic compliance at machine speed.
