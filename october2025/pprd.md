# do a gap analysis between the current state of the project and where Palantir products are going to be. Generate our PRD for MVP-2 and GA that exceeds all of their features measurably.

The initial web search provided a recent overview of Palantir's 2025 product roadmap, key features, and technology stack across its main platforms like Foundry, Gotham, Apollo, and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). I will synthesize findings to:

1. Conduct a gap analysis of the current project state versus where Palantir products are headed.
2. Generate an MVP-2 and General Availability (GA) Product Requirements Document (PRD) that measurably exceeds Palantir’s features.

Before drafting the PRD, I will review and consolidate the essential features, capabilities, and technology directions highlighted for Palantir’s products in 2025.

Next step: Summarize key Palantir product capabilities and direction, especially advanced AI/ML use, data integration, collaboration, secure operational workflows, and deployment models, to guide gap analysis and PRD specification.Palantir 2025 Product Summary:

- Key Platforms: Gotham (govt/intel/law enforcement), Foundry (commercial/enterprise), Apollo (continuous delivery), AI Platform (AIP for generative AI and automation)
- Core Features:
  - Massive data integration across federated and siloed sources with dynamic updates
  - AI/ML-powered analytics and decision-making, including predictive modeling and generative AI tools
  - Customizable and extensible data models with digital twins and operational simulations
  - Real-time collaboration, secure access controls, and auditability for sensitive data
  - Modular, scalable frontends built on React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and design frameworks
  - DevOps and deployment automation with cloud, edge, and hybrid environment support
  - Integration with ML tools (ONNX, PyTorch, MLFlow) for model lifecycle and experiment management
  - Industry use cases in defense, healthcare, finance, manufacturing, supply chain, and more

This strategic and technical baseline frames the gap analysis against a typical sophisticated data ops and AI product state.

For a complete gap analysis and comprehensive PRD generation, please provide or confirm:

- Current project status, features, tech stack, and capabilities
- Target industries and use cases you aim to exceed Palantir’s offerings in
- Constraints or priorities (e.g., cloud/on-prem, user roles, security/compliance)
- Approximate MVP-2 and GA timelines or milestones if defined

This will enable tailoring the PRD to measurably exceed Palantir’s capabilities with realistic scope and innovation pathways.
