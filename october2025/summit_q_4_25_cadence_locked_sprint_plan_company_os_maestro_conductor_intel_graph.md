# Summary

This plan locks delivery to the stated operating cadence (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly) and ensures there are **no gaps** in prerequisites, artifacts, or governance for **Summit CompanyOS**, **Maestro Conductor (MC)**, and **IntelGraph**. It maps 2‑week sprints for Q4’25, nests them within weekly reviews and monthly releases, and ties each deliverable to Disclosure‑first artifacts (SBOM, SLSA, DPA/DPIA when applicable) and canary/rollback criteria.

> **Timeframe:** Oct 6 – Dec 28, 2025 (6 sprints)  
> **Cadence anchors:** Daily Dispatch → Weekly Portfolio & Risk → Monthly Strategy & Metrics → Quarterly Board Brief

---

## 0) Cadence Lock & Governance “Rail Guards”

- **Daily (Horizon 01):** CEO Daily Dispatch (yesterday, today, blockers, risk heat), cash runway & pipeline delta.
- **Weekly (Horizon 02):** Portfolio Review (product/GTM/ops traffic lights + owner + next step), Risk & Compliance (incidents, policy drift, attestations).
- **Monthly (Horizon 03):** Strategy Update (bets, focus, capital rotation), Metrics Pack (OKR progress, SLOs, unit economics, CAC/LTV).
- **Quarterly (Horizon 04):** Board Brief (one‑pager + appendix + disclosure pack), Roadmap Review (bets reprioritized).

**Release Gate (MC) — required every releasable increment:**

- SBOM ✅ SLSA provenance ✅ Risk assessment ✅ DPA/DPIA if applicable ✅ Rollback plan ✅ Disclosure pack ✅
- **Canary policy:** traffic slice = 10%; auto‑rollback on SLO breach (2x window), security finding, data‑policy violation.

**Decision Protocol:**

- Classify one‑way vs two‑way doors; log each **Decision** node to IntelGraph with evidence and Maestro run IDs.
- Use the brief template: _Context, Options, Decision, Reversible?, Risks, Owners, Checks._

**Definitions:**

- **DoR (Definition of Ready):** JIRA story linked to IntelGraph claims, acceptance criteria, test plan, data policy labels.
- **DoD (Definition of Done):** Code + tests green, SLOs met, security checks passed, SBOM/SLSA attached, runbook + rollback, change logged to IntelGraph.

## 4) "No‑Gaps" Prereq Map (Who needs what, when)

- **IntelGraph** requires **ABAC** & **AuthN** from CompanyOS by **S1** → satisfied in S1.
- **MC** requires **artifact signing + scanners** by **S2** → wired in S2 with attestation hooks.
- **CompanyOS templates** require **IntelGraph deep links & Decision helpers** by **S4** → shipped by S4.
- **Canary/rollback** in MC needed before CompanyOS wider releases (**S3**) → delivered in S3.
- **Billing & metering** need **MC cost fields** to roll up (**S5**) → available since S1; dashboards in S5.
- **Quarter close** requires all disclosure artifacts and SOC2‑lite pack (**S6**) → covered by S5–S6.
