# MC Sprint — Q1’26 / Sprint 31 (2026‑03‑02 → 2026‑03‑13)
**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2026-03-02-sprint31-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q1’26 “Federate & Explain” (wave 5)

---
## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star
**Pilot Learnings → Production Decisions.** Graduate **Federated Search (FS)** from 2‑tenant pilot → **candidate for staged GA** (decision packet), finalize **XAI‑2** rollout and telemetry, enact **Predictive** GA decision (controlled rollout if “go”), progress **Marketplace Discovery (MP‑D)** toward limited pilot, and keep **Metering** steady with Finance sign‑offs. Onboard **+1** tenant via factory v2, while keeping SLOs comfortably green.

**Sprint Goal:** Turn pilot insights into shippable decisions: FS GA decision packet ready; XAI‑2 default‑on with near‑total coverage and stable telemetry; Predictive rollout follows decision; MP‑D pilot packet prepared; +1 tenant live; SLO headroom intact.

**Success KPIs:**
- SLO: **0** Sev‑1; burn alarms **< 20m** total; p95 (4‑hop/100k) **≤ 0.88s**  
- FS decision: decision memo signed; e2e p95 **≤ 1.25s** on pilot; complaint rate **< 1.5%**; quality delta ≥ **+5%** ctr@5  
- XAI‑2: rationale export coverage **≥ 98%**, counterfactual hints **≥ 90%**, opt‑out rate **< 3%**  
- Predictive rollout (if “go”): **+2** tenants enabled under quotas; audit sampling **≥ 99%**  
- MP‑D: pilot scope defined; **3–5** candidate sources curated with DPIA/license packets  
- Metering: variance **≤ 0.3%**; exports on schedule; Finance sign‑offs for pilot invoices  
- Onboarding: **+1** tenant live; zero policy blocks at go‑live

---
## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals
### In‑Scope
- **FS GA decision packet:** pilot readout, latency & quality gates, license‑aware blending validation, stitched provenance export proofs, rollback/playbook.  
- **XAI‑2 prod rollout completion:** default‑on exporters, a11y copy, counterfactual hints, export telemetry, opt‑out/consent flows, docs.  
- **Predictive GA enactment:** quotas, abuse rules, on‑call playbooks, rollout checklist, tenant allow‑list; if “no‑go,” remediation plan.  
- **MP‑D pilot planning:** catalog hardening, source vetting, DPIA/license packets, request‑to‑connect audit bundle.  
- **Onboarding factory v2:** +1 tenant; evidence bundle; policy simulator & appeal tokens.  
- **Metering steady‑state:** rotation rehearsal, drift alarms, finance dashboards & invoice previews.  
- Ops hygiene: warmers v3 experiments; access review exports; noisy‑alert reductions.

### Non‑Goals
- Open GA for FS/MP‑D this sprint (decision & pilot prep only).  
- MP‑D transactions/billing.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **FS decision blocked by edge cases** → explicit exceptions in memo; fallback to single index; staged GA scope.  
- **XAI telemetry noise** → bucketing; sampling; alert thresholds.  
- **Predictive misuse** → quotas; rollback playbook; exemplar guidance.  
- **License enforcement drift** → registry checksums; clause previews; ombuds packet.  
- **Metering drift** → rotation rehearsal; drift alarms; Finance co‑review.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- FS p95 & ctr@5; complaint rate; XAI export/hint coverage; predictive audits (≥99%); onboarding throughput; metering variance (≤0.3%); burn alarms (<20m).  
- Weekly: burndown, scope ledger, blocker aging.
