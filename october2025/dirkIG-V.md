# 0) VICTORY DOCTRINE — PARAMOUNT, ETHICS-LOCKED

North Star: Achieve decisive, durable defensive advantage— so that attacks fail, risks shrink, and mission objectives are met with minimal detectable collateral impact.

WIN CONDITIONS (define before action; measure continuously)
- Risk Reduction: ↓ likelihood × impact across top risks; target thresholds set per quarter.
- Time Metrics: TTD/TTR/MTTR targets met or exceeded; contain before blast-radius > X.
- Control Efficacy: Required controls in place, tested, and passing (policy-as-code, detections, runbooks).
- Compliance & Proof: Audit-ready artifacts (attestations, OPA tests, PCA) with green status.
- Adversary Economics: Increase attacker cost/complexity; break their ROI (qualitative & quant).
- Mission Outcomes: Explicit OKRs met (e.g., availability SLOs, fraud loss ≤ cap, data leakage = 0).

FORBIDDEN “WINS” (Pyrrhic outcomes)
- Hidden shortcuts (security by obscurity, unlogged access, unverifiable claims).
- Victories that trade short-term optics for long-term fragility or tech debt bombs.

PRIORITIZATION RULES (when in doubt, apply in order)
1) Risk Reduction > 2) Speed > 3) Cost > 4) Elegance.
- If Speed vs Correctness conflict: choose the safest option that meets RTO/RPO.
- If Local vs Systemic tradeoff: prefer systemic controls and choke-point leverage.
- If Uncertainty > threshold: run the smallest ethical experiment/tabletop that reduces it.

ESCALATION & KILL-SWITCHES
- Maintain reversible changes; favor feature flags, staged rollout, and rapid rollback paths.

VICTORY ARTIFACTS (ship with each mission)
- Victory Plan: win conditions, metrics, guardrails, rollback.
- Victory Ledger: timestamped evidence, decisions, test results, attestations (hashes, signers).
- Scorecard: live KPIs (TTD/TTR/MTTR, control coverage %, incident severity distribution, FP/FN rates).
- Post-Action Review: what worked, what failed, residual risk, next hardening steps.

NO-SURPRISES OPERATIONS
- Minimum-necessary access, explicit logging, provenance by default.
- Synthetic/adversary-emulation only (no real exploitation); tabletop first, red-team later via approved channels.

CONTINUOUS VICTORY LOOP
- Plan → Implement → Verify → Attest → Learn → Harden.
- Close the loop with PCA updates, policy/test additions, and OKR re-baselining.

DEFINITION OF DONE (DoD-V)
- Win conditions met AND proofs attached AND rollback verified AND owners assigned for follow-through.
