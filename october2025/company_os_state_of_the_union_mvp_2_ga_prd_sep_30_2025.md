# CompanyOS – State of the Union, MVP‑2 & GA PRD

_Date:_ **September 30, 2025**  
_Owner:_ **Architect‑General (Cump IG)**  
_Stakeholders:_ Platform Eng, SRE, SecOps, Data, Product Ops, GTM, Compliance

> **North Star:** Deliver CompanyOS—a production‑grade, auditable, policy‑governed operating system for the company and white‑label customers. Operate with separation of concerns, deterministic supply chain, and idempotent, reversible deployments. Evidence or it didn’t happen.

---

## 0) Executive Summary

We’ve flipped the "summit" monorepo public and now need to harden, converge, and ship **MVP‑2** (90‑day horizon) while laying concrete for **GA** (12‑18 months). The repo already contains the primitives to build our **Intelligence Fabric (Summit / IntelGraph)** and **Execution Fabric (Maestro Conductor + Policy Gates)**, with significant scaffolding for observability, security, and data operations.

**Immediate objective:** Align the portfolio around a paved‑road platform (golden paths + policy packs) and ship 3 user‑visible capabilities with full compliance artifacts, then expand into GA with white‑label automation, multi‑tenant policy & residency, and sealed supply chain.

**Definition of Winning:**

- **MVP‑2:** 3 external users successfully run CompanyOS in a managed environment with signed artifacts, SLO dashboards, and audit export; 1 white‑label pilot configured end‑to‑end from templates.
- **GA:** Multi‑tenant SaaS + self‑host capable, policy‑governed deployments with SBOM+SLSA provenance, OPA federation, residency controls, and hardened runtime; 3 paying customers; 95% golden‑path adoption internally.

## 1) Where We Are — Repo Recon (Public Surface)

_Observed top‑level assets and signals (non‑exhaustive; reflects current public tree):_

- **Architecture & Governance Artifacts**: `adr/`, `.evidence/`, `SECURITY/`, `RUNBOOKS/`, `audit/`, `controls/`, `contracts/`
- **Execution Fabric**: `.maestro/`, `.mc/`, `conductor-ui/`, `controllers/`, `cli/`, `compose/`, `deploy/`, `charts/`, `docker/`
- **Intelligence Fabric**: `catalog/`, `activities/`, `analysis/`, `cognitive-insights/`, `cognitive_insights_engine/`, `cognitive-targeting-engine/`, `ai-ml-suite/`
- **Data Spine**: `data/`, `db/`, `data-pipelines/`, `airflow/dags/` (ETL/C DC), `connectors/`
- **Observability**: `alerting/`, `alertmanager/`, `dashboard/`, `dash/`, `benchmarks/harness/`
- **Security**: `.security/`, `crypto/kms/`, `.githooks/`, `.husky/`, `.github/` (Actions/Checks), `.vale/` (docs lint), `.zap/` (DAST), `clients/cos-policy-fetcher/`
- **Product & UX**: `apps/`, `client/` + `client-v039/`, `conductor-ui/`, `docs-site/`, `brands/`, `comms/templates/`
- **Standards & Golden Paths**: `GOLDEN/datasets/`, `config/`, `companyos/` (platform root), `charts/` (Helm), `deploy/`, `compose/`
- **Evidence of Active Ops**: `bug-bash-results/20250922/`, `archive_20250926/` (cleanup cadence), `backlog/`

**Signals:** Strong alignment to the Prime Directive (policy & evidence first), extensive scaffolding for CI/CD and security, and a monorepo structure suitable for paved‑road tooling. Gaps remain in: cross‑cutting threat model, multi‑tenant tenancy boundary, formal SLO kits per service, and one‑click white‑label automation.

---

## 2) Target Architecture (C4‑ish) & Platform Primitives

### 2.1 Context (C1)

- **Actors**: Operators (SRE/SecOps), Builders (platform/product devs), Tenants (customers/white‑label), Data Stewards, Compliance Officers.
- **Systems**:
  - **CompanyOS Platform** (paved road, policy fabric, golden paths).
  - **IntelGraph** (graph+timeline+map, provenance‑first).
  - **Maestro Conductor (MC)** (plans, orchestrates, and gates changes via OPA/ABAC).
  - **Observability Stack** (Prometheus/Grafana, structured logs, traces).
  - **CI/CD** (provenance + attestations; SBOM; signatures; SLSA‑aligned).

### 2.2 Containers (C2)

- **APIs** (`api/`, `apis/`): stateless services with typed interfaces, OpenAPI contracts, auth via OIDC + step‑up WebAuthn; policy sidecar.
- **IntelGraph Services** (`catalog/`, `activities/`, `analysis/`): event‑sourced ingestion, graph store, timeline index, map tiler; provenance ledger.
- **MC Orchestrator** (`.maestro/`, `.mc/`, `controllers/`, `conductor-ui/`): workflow engine, policy evaluation (OPA), rollout manager, canary controller.
- **Data Spine** (`data-pipelines/`, `airflow/dags/`, `connectors/`, `db/`): CDC into lake/warehouse; schema versioning; lineage.
- **Edge & Clients** (`client/`, `client-v039/`, `apps/`): progressive disclosure UI, in‑app “why/how” telemetry.
- **Security Services** (`crypto/kms/`, `.security/`): KMS broker, secret provisioning, signing service.

### 2.3 Components (C3)

- **Policy Fabric**: OPA bundles, ABAC evaluator, policy distribution/rollback, disclosure packager, data redaction library.
- **Release Manager**: canary manager, automated rollbacks, error budget guard, synthetic probes.
- **Provenance & Supply Chain**: SBOM gen, sigstore/cosign sign+verify, SLSA provenance attestations, CVE budget gate.
- **Observability First**: standard SDK, golden dashboards, SLO kit per service, alertmanager wiring.

### 2.4 Code‑Level (C4, exemplar patterns)

- **Service Template**: typed interface, OpenAPI, Healthz, Metrics, Tracing, OPA check hooks, SBOM make target, Helm chart, runbook.
- **Data Job Template**: Airflow DAG with lineage annotations, schema registry bump, residency label, budgeted retries, test fixtures.

---

## 3) Gaps & Risks (Portfolio Balance Sheet)

**Architecture / Platform**

- Multi‑tenant boundary & tenancy isolation policy not codified across all services.
- Policy pack distribution and rollback story partially implemented; needs atomic, versioned releases + cohort rollout.
- No single **Threat Model** document spanning IntelGraph + MC + supply chain.

**Security / Compliance**

- End‑to‑end SLSA provenance not enforced at all gates (pre‑merge vs pre‑release parity).
- Secrets lifecycle: rotation cadence and envelope encryption not uniform across services.
- Redaction & DLP guards exist in parts, but not standardized across ingest paths.

**Data**

- Unified schema registry & lineage view exist in pieces; residency & retention tags not enforced end‑to‑end.
- CDC/ingestion replay + backfill guardrails need hardening.

**Observability & Ops**

- SLO kits not universally adopted; synthetic probes limited.
- Canary/rollback scripts exist but not integrated as “one switch” in MC.

**Dev Ergonomics**

- Local dev (`docker compose`) stacks exist, but hot‑reload + seed datasets inconsistent; test runtime budgets drift.

## 4) MVP‑2 PRD (90‑Day, Now‑Value)

### 4.1 Problem Statement

Teams and early pilots need a reliable paved road to ship features behind policy gates with audit‑ready evidence and fast rollback. Today, primitives exist but are fragmented.

### 4.2 Objectives & Success Metrics

- **O1.** One‑click scaffold → deploy for a new service on the paved road (golden path adoption **≥85%** for new services).
- **O2.** End‑to‑end signed artifacts with SBOM + provenance attached to each release (**100%** for paved‑road services).
- **O3.** Policy gates enforce ABAC, data residency & disclosure packaging on ingress/egress (**0 critical violations** in canary).
- **O4.** SLO kits live: latency, availability, and error budget dashboards with tested alerts (**100%** coverage for paved‑road services).
- **O5.** Audit export ready: evidence bundles (ADR, SBOM, attestations, release notes) exportable per release.

### 4.3 In‑Scope (MVP‑2)

1. **Golden Path Platform v1**
   - Repo scaffolds (`cli` generator), standard service template, Helm chart, policy sidecar wiring, CI workflow template.
   - "Depot Day" refresh: paved‑road templates, lints, and checks.
2. **Policy Fabric v1**
   - OPA bundle build/publish; ABAC evaluator; data residency tags; disclosure packager; redaction library.
   - Policy cohort rollout + rollback plan.
3. **Supply Chain v1**
   - SBOM (cyclonedx/spdx), cosign signing + verification, SLSA provenance attestation, CVE budget gate.
4. **Release & Reliability v1**
   - Canary manager; synthetic probes; automated rollback; error budget enforcement; runbooks.
5. **Observability First v1**
   - SDK; golden dashboards; SLO kits per service; alertmanager integration; e2e probes for 3 critical paths.
6. **White‑Label Pilot v0**
   - Configurable theming/branding, policy packs per tenant, tenant secrets bootstrap; 1 pilot tenant end‑to‑end.

### 4.4 Out‑of‑Scope (for MVP‑2)

- Full multi‑region geo‑fencing; advanced chargeback; BYOK‑HSM; cross‑tenant analytics.

### 4.5 Users & Jobs‑To‑Be‑Done

- **Platform Dev**: scaffold → code → ship via paved road; see SLOs; pass gates.
- **SRE/SecOps**: operate with SLOs, probes, and rollback; verify signatures; export audit.
- **Data Steward**: tag datasets; enforce residency; review disclosures.
- **Tenant Admin**: apply policy pack; brand UI; manage secrets.

### 4.6 Requirements (Functional)

- **F1** Scaffold CLI (`companyos new service`) generates: repo module, Dockerfile, SBOM targets, OPA hooks, Helm chart, CI pipeline, runbook stub, SLO kit stubs.
- **F2** Policy packs defined in code: ABAC rules, residency tags, disclosure templates; packaged and versioned; applied at ingress/egress.
- **F3** CI gates: secret scan, license scan, SAST, unit+integration tests, OPA evaluation; pre‑release: SBOM, sign, verify, CVE budget check; post‑release: drift + attestation validate.
- **F4** MC canary: traffic split, synthetic probe watch, auto‑rollback on SLO breach; evidence snapshot captured.
- **F5** Audit export: zip bundle containing ADRs, SBOMs, signatures, release notes, policy evaluations, probe results.

### 4.7 Non‑Functional Requirements

- **Availability:** ≥99.5% for MC control plane (pilot scope).
- **Latency:** P95 < 250ms for policy checks; P95 < 150ms for service health endpoints.
- **Security:** All artifacts signed; vulnerabilities with CVSS ≥7 blocked unless waived; waivers time‑boxed.
- **Compliance:** Residency labels on all datasets; disclosure pack present for external data egress.
- **Observability:** 100% paved‑road services expose metrics/logs/traces; golden dashboards exist and are linked in runbooks.
- **Performance:** Template services handle 500 RPS baseline on dev cluster with CPU budget caps.

### 4.8 Acceptance Criteria (AC)

- **AC‑1:** Creating a new service via CLI and merging first PR yields a signed container with attached SBOM and a passing policy evaluation.
- **AC‑2:** Deploying via MC canary performs traffic split, monitors probes, and auto‑rolls back upon induced failure.
- **AC‑3:** SLO dashboards for the new service show latency/availability; synthetic probe visible; alert fires in test.
- **AC‑4:** A sample dataset marked `EU‑Only` is blocked from US region egress without approved disclosure pack.
- **AC‑5:** Audit export is downloadable and includes all expected artifacts for a given release SHA.

### 4.9 Telemetry & Evidence

- Post‑deploy verification checklist + archived evidence in `.evidence/`.
- Dashboards links stored in `RUNBOOKS/` for each service.

### 4.10 Rollout & Risk

- **Rollout:** flag‑gated; cohort of internal services first, then pilot tenant.
- **Risks:** policy regression causing false blocks; signing infra outages; probe flakiness.
- **Mitigations:** blue/green for policy bundles; offline signing cache; probe stabilization sprints.

## 17) Callouts & TODOs

- Authoritative threat model and multi‑tenant boundary tests are the two biggest deltas to GA.
- Drive golden‑path adoption via migration sprints; enforce with light‑touch governance (scorecards in Evidence Review).
- Keep budgets: latency, error budgets, CVE; publish weekly.

> **Operating Slogans:** Logistics wins; evidence speaks. Policies are code; compliance is continuous. Move the bottleneck; compound the moat. Small PRs; big impact.
