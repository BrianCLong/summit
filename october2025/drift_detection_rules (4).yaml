[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Feb 17 – Feb 28, 2026 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Visual Edge Explanation + Adaptive Prompt Shaping — expose why each join occurred, guide prompt structure.
- **Workstream Theme:** Visualize Causality, Adapt Preemptively — align human intuition with graph logic.
- **Target Output:** Edge explainer UI, real-time prompt reshaping agent, volatile path hint system.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE
- Semantic diffs showed where output drifted, but not **why joins happened** — edge-level visuals clarify this.
- Static prompt filters are insufficient under dynamic evidence graphs; shaping must evolve per context.
- Analyst trust increases with both **clarity of joins** and **adaptive framing** of inputs.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Feb 17–28)
1. **Visual Edge Explainer**
   - UI overlay on graph joins: why this edge, from what claim, by which rule.  
   - Supports click-to-expand: upstream path, triggering prompt segment.
2. **Adaptive Prompt Shaper**
   - Real-time rewrites of risky or ambiguous phrases.  
   - Learns from classifier, override feedback, and result deltas.
3. **Volatile Path Hint Engine**
   - As-you-type tags for inputs likely to hit unstable joins.  
   - Optional auto-narrow or ask-to-confirm.
4. **Explainer Effectiveness Metrics**
   - Measure override reduction, prompt clarity score delta, join comprehension rate.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)
- Natural Language “Why?” API (ExplainWhy)
- Multilingual prompt understanding + stability classification

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE
- **Sources:** Click telemetry, prompt-edit logs, join-path volatility index.
- **Assumptions:** Prompt editor is capable of dynamic rewriting + tagging.
- **Uncertainty:** Edge explainability visual density may overload interface.
- **Verification:**
  - Usability sessions on edge tracer  
  - Prompt edit delta logs  
  - Tag success → join volatility correlation

## CADENCE PLAN (Q1 '26)

| Layer         | Cadence             | Responsible Artifact                            |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Daily         | Prompt Edit Stream  | Rewrite Events, Tag Hit Stats                   |
| Weekly        | Join Clarity Sync   | Edge Explain Coverage %, Analyst Trust Score    |
| Biweekly (83M)| Shaper Diff Sync    | Original vs. Final Prompt Divergence Metrics    |
| Monthly       | Explainer Brief     | Effectiveness KPIs, Drop in Override/Drift      |
| Quarterly     | Trust Comprehension | Human-perceived accuracy vs. actual explainability|

**Next Steps:**
- Visual edge UI alpha deploy (Feb 19)  
- Shaper agent live (Feb 22)  
- Effectiveness metrics baseline (Feb 28)
