## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **FS GA regressions at scale** → strict alarms; staged fallbacks; A/B single‑index; rollback scripts.  
- **Predictive misuse** → quotas; sandbox; rollback drills; exemplar guidance.  
- **MP‑D license/regulatory drift** → packet checksums; SLA tracker; ombuds exports.  
- **XAI latency spikes** → warmers; retry windows; bucketed alerts; back‑pressure.  
- **FS‑v2 instability** → staging only; fail‑safe; adapter contract tests.  
- **Metering drift** → rotation rehearsal; alarms; Finance co‑review.  
- **Onboarding surge** → factory lanes; policy sim; appeal tokens; office hours.
