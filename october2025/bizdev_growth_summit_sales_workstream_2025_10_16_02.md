[Name], pilot findings show [X% cycle time ↓ / Y risks mitigated]. Here’s the runbook + rollback. Can we do a 30‑min decision workshop with [Sponsor, Security, Data] this week?

**Email – Partner Intro**  
_Subject:_ Better together: Summit × [Partner]  
We help [mission/industry] with provenance‑first graph+AI. Proposed teaming (margin [x%]), 10‑acct joint list, and a 45‑min enablement. Open to a quick review?

## 6) Risks & Mitigations
- **Security review stalls** → Pre‑flight CFK + Security Architect office hours.  
- **Legal redlines delay** → Pre‑approved boilerplate; carve out milestone acceptance.  
- **Partner overlap/conflict** → Deal reg + territory definitions; escalation path.  
- **Pilot data access gaps** → Data owner sign‑off checklist; mock datasets for demo if needed.
