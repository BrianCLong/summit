# MC Sprint — Q1’26 / Sprint 32 (2026‑03‑16 → 2026‑03‑27)

**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2026-03-16-sprint32-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q1’26 “Federate & Explain” (wave 6)

---

## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star

**Decisions → Rollouts.** If approved, take **Federated Search (FS)** into **staged GA** (controlled tenant cohorts); complete **Predictive** rollout or enact its remediation plan; run a **limited pilot** of **Marketplace Discovery (MP‑D)**; finish **XAI‑2** polish and telemetry reliability; keep **Metering** steady‑state; and onboard **+1** new tenant with self‑serve packs.

**Sprint Goal:** Staged GA of FS with safe fallbacks and stitched provenance; Predictive either rolling out to +3 tenants under quotas or executing a signed remediation path; MP‑D pilot live with 3–5 vetted sources; SLOs with comfortable headroom; metering exports on schedule.

**Success KPIs:**

- SLO: **0** Sev‑1; burn alarms **< 15m** total; p95 (4‑hop/100k) **≤ 0.86s**
- FS staged GA: **2 cohorts** (total **4 tenants**), e2e p95 **≤ 1.25s**, complaint rate **< 1.5%**, ≥ **+5%** ctr@5 vs baseline
- Predictive rollout (if go): **+3** tenants enabled; audit sampling **≥ 99%**; zero rollback events. _(If no‑go: remediation milestones 100% complete)_
- MP‑D pilot: **3–5** sources live; request‑to‑connect packets verify; Ombuds exportable audit trail
- XAI‑2: export coverage **≥ 98%**; counterfactual hints **≥ 90%**; opt‑out **< 3%**
- Metering: variance **≤ 0.3%**; all tenant exports delivered on schedule
- Onboarding: **+1** tenant live; zero policy blocks at go‑live

---

## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals

### In‑Scope

- **FS staged GA:** cohort gating, rollout checklist, quality dashboards, license‑aware blending checks, stitched provenance exports, fallback to single‑index.
- **Predictive rollout/remediation:** quotas, abuse gates, on‑call playbooks, monitoring KPIs, rollback rehearsals **or** remediation tasks per decision memo.
- **MP‑D pilot:** catalog hardening, vetted source cards with DPIA/license, request‑to‑connect with signed audit packet.
- **XAI‑2 polish:** reliability of exporters, telemetry buckets, a11y copy fixes, caveat banners.
- **Metering steady‑state:** rotation schedule, drift alarms, finance dashboards.
- **Onboarding factory v2:** self‑serve packs, policy sim, appeal tokens, evidence bundles.
- **Ops hygiene:** warmers v3 experiment, noisy‑alert cleanup, access reviews.

### Non‑Goals

- MP‑D transactions/billing.
- FS open GA for _all_ tenants (staged cohorts only this sprint).
