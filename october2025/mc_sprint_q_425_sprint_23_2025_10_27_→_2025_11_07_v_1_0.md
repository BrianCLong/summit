## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star

**Pilot → Production Hardening.** Graduate the canary pilot into a blue/green prod rollout behind policy gates, complete provenance analytics, bring **Predictive Suite** to _customer‑preview_, solidify **Offline Kit 1.2** with operator console, and lift connector coverage to **T16‑B**. Lock in SLOs and finalize compliance evidence for SOC2 Type I handoff.

**Sprint Goal:** Ship a production‑ready build with blue/green deploys, rollback tested, signed provenance bundles w/ rotation, predictive preview gated per tenant, and an operator‑friendly offline/merge workflow.

**Success KPIs:**

- p95 (3‑hop/75k) **< 1.1s** prod‑like
- Zero cross‑tenant leaks on **10k** randomized policy fuzz cases
- Blue/green switch **< 5m** with **0** data loss in shadow traffic
- Provenance contradiction resolution SLA **< 48h** (test set)
- Cost Guard: ≥ **8** valid blocks, ≤ **1** false block
- Offline 1.2: conflict console reduces manual time per case by **30%**
- Connectors **T16‑B**: 16 shipped w/ manifests, DPIA, license/TOS checks, golden IO tests
- Compliance: SOC2 evidence binder **90%** complete; gaps assigned with due dates

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **Blue/green drift** → config diff checks; freeze window; rollback rehearsals.
- **Policy over‑/under‑blocking** → fuzz tests; appeal tokens; telemetry on deltas.
- **Predictive misuse** → allow‑list; rate limits; audit trails; canned demos.
- **Conflict surge offline** → recipes; macros; staffing plan for spikes.
- **License enforcement false‑positives** → human review queue; clause overrides with dual‑control.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- Latency/throughput, shadow deltas, contradiction SLA, preview usage, cost guard actions, blue/green switch time, evidence coverage.
- Weekly: burndown, scope change ledger, blocker aging, compliance gap burndown.

---
## 11) Demo Script (10–12 min)
1. Blue/green switch (shadow on) → SLO overlays → rollback rehearsal.
2. Policy fuzz highlight → heavy query shows cost hints; persisted query appeal.
3. Provenance analytics: contradiction density; right‑to‑reply SLA; license blocker case.
4. Predictive preview gated tenant: run forecast; show model card & audit events.
5. Offline 1.2: conflict console in action; recipe macro resolves case.
6. Connector T16‑B: license gate + mapping review; verifier CLI sample.
7. Evidence binder export; access review report snapshot.

---
## 12) Backlog Index & Sizing
- Blue/green & shadow: 5 stories @ 5–8 pts
- Core & policy: 4 stories @ 3–5 pts
- Provenance analytics: 3 stories @ 5–8 pts
- Predictive preview: 3 stories @ 5–8 pts
- Offline 1.2: 3 stories @ 3–5 pts
- Connectors T16‑B: 16 × (2–5 pts)

---
## 13) Change Log (for this sprint plan)
