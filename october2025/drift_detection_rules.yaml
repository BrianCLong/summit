[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Nov 17 – Nov 28, 2025 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Graph Explainability and Model Fingerprinting — expose cause chains, normalize prompt variance.
- **Workstream Theme:** Comprehension, Control, Containment — illuminate graph logic and trace LLM behavior.
- **Target Output:** Explainability API, Model Fingerprint Registry, Prompt Templates Library.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE
- Drift Harness and Replay Dashboards showed real variance — now we must **explain** it.
- Analysts need structured insight into how claims connect, what logic drove results, and how models shift.
- No baseline prompt behavior is yet locked; this sprint remedies that.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Nov 17–28)
1. **Graph Explainability API (ExplainX)**
   - Walk-back reasoning chain from NL → Cypher → claim path.  
   - Return node influences, constraints triggered, edge hops.
2. **Model Fingerprint Registry**
   - Log model weights, vendor, config hash at time of inference.  
   - Detect model drift via delta hashes.
3. **Prompt Normalization Library**
   - Define canonical form for each query class.  
   - Map user variation to canonical template; compare outputs.
4. **Contextual Diff Tool**
   - Diff two reasoning paths; explain divergence.  
   - Tag unstable joins and cite trigger nodes.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)
- ExplainX UI with temporal replay
- Risk-weighted claim surfaces map

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE
- **Sources:** Replay logs, fingerprint hashes, lineage path digests.
- **Assumptions:** Model config is auditable + logged at time of RAG.
- **Uncertainty:** Diff tool may misattribute semantically equivalent paths.
- **Verification:**
  - Delta detection on hash drift
  - ExplainX integration test with known output

## CADENCE PLAN (Q4 '25)

| Layer         | Cadence        | Responsible Artifact                             |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Daily         | Explain Logs   | Reason Path Walks, Prompt Fingerprints           |
| Weekly        | Canonical Audit| Prompt Template Regression                       |
| Biweekly (83M)| Model Drift Log| Fingerprint Hashes, RAG Integrity Traces         |
| Monthly       | Explain Brief  | Unstable Claim Surfaces                          |
| Quarterly     | Comprehension  | Causal Maps, Model Stability Report              |

**Next Steps:**
