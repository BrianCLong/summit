# MC Sprint — Q4’25 / Sprint 22 (2025‑10‑13 → 2025‑10‑24)

**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2025-10-13-sprint22-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q4’25 “Foundations GA” (wave 2)

---

## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star

**From Beta → Field‑Ready.** Convert the working slice from Sprint 21 into a pilot‑deployable package: tighten multi‑tenant isolation, expand provenance coverage, promote Predictive Suite to **beta** behind gates, complete **Offline Kit v1.1**, and take the **Connector T12‑A** tranche to done‑done. Compliance scaffolds (SOC2/ISO) and response playbooks land.

**Sprint Goal:** Deliver a canary rollout build (staging → pilot) with signed provenance bundles, enforced policy gates, SLO dashboards wired to burn alerts, and a scripted offline case that re‑syncs cleanly under CRDT rules.

**Success KPIs:**

- p95 query latency (3‑hop/50k) **< 1.2s** (staging, steady)
- Ingest **20k docs < 5m** across 4 parallel connectors (no dropped spans)
- Provenance bundles verified **100%** via external verifier; contradiction/reply coverage ≥ **80%** for test set
- Cost Guard: ≥ **5** blocks w/ actionable hints + **0** false blocks on golden suite
- Offline v1.1: auto‑merge rate ≥ **95%**; operator‑approved conflicts documented
- Multi‑tenant fuzz: **0** cross‑tenant leaks on 5k randomized policies
- Connector T12‑A: **12** connectors ship with manifests, DPIA, license/TOS checks, and golden IO tests

---

## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals

### In‑Scope

- Multi‑tenant isolation hardening (ABAC + row partitioning + OPA policy packs; fuzz & chaos).
- Provenance & Claim Ledger **M3** (bundle signing; chain‑of‑custody view; contradiction analytics).
- Predictive Threat Suite **beta** promotion (model card + guardrails + audit trails).
- Offline Kit **v1.1** (delta‑sync compression, resumable transfers, signed divergence map).
- Connector tranche **T12‑A** and mapping‑wizard UX polish.
- SRE/SOC2 scaffolds (controls matrix, evidence binder seeds, incident runbooks).

### Non‑Goals (this sprint)

- Federated multi‑graph search.
- Public marketplace listing.
- Advanced XAI fairness metrics (tracked only).

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **Key rotation outage** → staged rotation + dry‑run verifier; emergency re‑sign path.
- **Policy over‑blocking** → appeal tokens; supervisor override; telemetry on false blocks.
- **Forecast misuse** → input gate + audit trails; rate limits; canned exemplars.
- **Offline conflicts** → operator console; CRDT merge policies documented.
- **Connector license drift** → license registry with checksums; export blockers; human review queue.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- Latency heatmaps; ingest throughput; contradiction density; forecast request distribution; cost guard actions; burn alerts; pilot canary health.
- Weekly: burndown, scope ledger, blocker aging; compliance gap list.

---
## 11) Demo Script (10–12 min)
1. Canary build toggles; OPA policy sim.
2. Ingest via Connector #7 (license gate) → mapping wizard diff → DPIA.
3. Provenance chain‑of‑custody view → export → verify (rotated key).
4. Predictive beta: forecast + counterfactual packet; audit trail peek.
5. SLO dashboard tour; trigger costly query → guarded partial; burn alert drill recap.
6. Offline v1.1: drop network mid‑sync → resume; divergence map signed.
7. Compliance binder seeds + canary checklist & rollback.
