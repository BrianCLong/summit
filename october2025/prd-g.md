# do a gap analysis between the current state of the project and where Graphika is going to be. Generate our PRD for MVP-2 and GA that exceeds all of their features measurably.

The current state of Graphika’s platform centers on advanced social network analysis, AI-driven narrative intelligence, and real-time threat detection primarily for government, non-profit, digital marketing, internet/technology platforms, and corporate strategic decision-makers. Their product suite provides multiple tiered access levels (Growth, Company, Enterprise) with features such as:

- Access to intelligence feeds including narrative and social media analysis
- Analyst and SME calls
- Network discovery maps
- Deep-dive reports
- AI-powered detection of coordinated influence operations, scams, harassment, and disinformation
- Customizable APIs and integrations (e.g., Slack, team workflows)
- Advanced R\&D capabilities continuing to push network science and machine learning
- Crisis response intelligence
- Trend and target audience discovery
- Enterprise data downloads and scalable access

Graphika's product emphasizes delivering actionable intelligence and proactive threat detection through a combination of patented technology and world-class analytical expertise.

For MVP-2 and General Availability (GA), to exceed Graphika’s features measurably, a PRD (Product Requirements Document) should include:

### MVP-2 Objectives

- Real-time AI-enhanced social network and narrative intelligence exceeding Graphika’s existing detection speed and accuracy.
- Advanced, customizable automated reporting and alerting beyond current narrative feeds.
- Deep integration with multiple channels and platforms beyond Slack (teams, Dynamics, Salesforce).
- Enhanced AI/ML-powered threat categorization, including predictive future event modeling.
- Intuitive visualizations and user experience improvements allowing non-expert users to act decisively.
- Scalable multi-tenant architecture with robust security and compliance for enterprise needs.
- Collaborative investigation tools with annotation, sharing, and audit trails.

### GA Objectives

- Complete product feature parity and enhancements across all Graphika feature tiers with measurable improvements in:
  - Intelligence feed comprehensiveness and delivery speed
  - Network and influencer mapping granularity
  - User-customized analytics workflows and API extensibility
  - Crisis response automation and playbook-driven recommendations
  - Multi-industry vertical solutions with domain-specific intelligence models
  - Comprehensive data export, integration, and ecosystem connectivity
- AI explainability and model transparency to empower trust in automated insights
- Advanced user and role management, incorporating organization-wide governance
- Global scale deployment with near-zero downtime and disaster recovery guarantees
- Full compliance with data privacy, regional regulations, and industry certifications

---

If agreeable, the next step is to create a structured PRD document with these elements detailed in sections such as:

- Overview
- Objectives and Success Metrics
- User Personas and Use Cases
- Competitive Feature Gap Analysis (Graphika vs proposed)
- Feature List for MVP-2 and GA
- Architecture and Technical Considerations
- Roadmap and Milestones
- Risk and Mitigation Strategies

Would you like to proceed with generating a detailed PRD draft following this outline?
