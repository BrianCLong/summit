# MC Sprint — Q4’25 / Sprint 25 (2025‑11‑24 → 2025‑12‑05)

**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2025-11-24-sprint25-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q4’25 “Foundations GA” (Release + Post‑GA Hardening)

---

## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star

**Release Week → Stability & Customer Onboarding.** Execute controlled GA release, absorb early‑field feedback, harden cost/SLO/DR guarantees, scale tenant onboarding, and prepare the **Q1’26 roadmap**. Expand Predictive Suite controlled GA footprint and deliver **Offline Kit 1.4** with preflight checks and safe‑harbor export.

**Sprint Goal:** A calm, auditable GA release week with crisp on‑call, clear rollback, and top‑5 customer onboarding complete; post‑GA issues triaged and remediated within SLA, with billing/metering ready for pilot invoicing.

**Success KPIs:**

- GA cutover: **0 P1 incidents**, **<=2** P2s, mean time to mitigate **< 15m**
- p95 (GA tenants, 4‑hop/100k) **< 1.0s** steady for 7 days
- DR readiness re‑test: RTO **< 15m**, RPO **< 60s** (prod‑shadow)
- Onboarding: **5 tenants** through checklist; **3** have Predictive controlled GA enabled
- Billing/Metering: usage reports delivered for **all GA tenants**; variance **< 2%** vs shadow meter
- Offline 1.4: preflight passes; safe‑harbor export verified by prov‑verifier
- Support SLOs: first‑response **< 1h** business, resolution **< 48h** for P3/4

---

## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals

### In‑Scope

- Release coordination (change‑freeze, comms, status page, on‑call rotations).
- Post‑GA stabilization: hotfix lanes, perf guardrails, policy fuzz regressions, a11y verifications.
- Tenant onboarding factory: checklists, data DPIA, license registry binding, persisted‑query packs.
- Billing & Metering MVP: per‑tenant query/ingest storage compute; export CSV + signed JSON.
- Predictive controlled GA expansion (allow‑list, quotas, audit sampling).
- Offline Kit **1.4**: preflight validator, safe‑harbor export, redaction attestations.
- Customer evidence packager: disclosure packs + signed provenance bundle with contradiction appendix.
- Q1’26 roadmap shaping & OKRs draft.

### Non‑Goals

- Public self‑serve onboarding or marketplace.
- Predictive Suite open GA (remains controlled).
- New connector families beyond committed backlog (finish T20‑C tail only).

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **Holiday coverage gaps** → paired on‑call; comms templates; pre‑approved rollback.
- **Meter variance** → shadow meter compare; drift alerts; manual sampling.
- **Policy false‑blocks for new tenants** → policy sim; appeal tokens; supervised overrides.
- **Predictive misuse** → quotas; audit sampling; exemplar library; rollback playbook.
- **Safe‑harbor overshare** → redaction attestations; license‑aware export rules.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- Incident counts/MTTM, p95 per tenant, DR readiness, onboarding throughput, meter variance, predictive usage, offline preflight pass rate, evidence pack verification rate.
- Weekly: burndown, scope change ledger, blocker aging, OKR draft progress.
