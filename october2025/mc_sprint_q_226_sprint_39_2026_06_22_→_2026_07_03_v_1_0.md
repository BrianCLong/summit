## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star

**Close the Quarter Clean; Stage H2.** Hold GA‑scale excellence for **FS / Predictive / XAI‑2**, finish **MP‑D** broad pilot with partner feedback incorporated, ship **FS‑v2 planner MVP‑3** with 5–6 sources in staging and a go/no‑go packet, conclude **XAI‑2.1** experiment with decision memo, deliver **Metering** quarter‑close artifacts, and maximize **Onboarding Factory** throughput before holiday gaps.

**Sprint Goal:** Zero‑drama quarter close with evidence everywhere; next‑gen bets ready for H2 planning (FS‑v2 go/no‑go, XAI‑2.1 decision). Onboard **+2–3** tenants via self‑serve packs; maintain SLO headroom.

**Success KPIs:**

- FS GA: e2e p95 **≤ 1.14s**, complaint rate **< 0.7%**, ctr@5 ≥ **+7%** vs baseline
- Predictive: tenant coverage **≥ 92%**, audits **≥ 99%**, **0** rollbacks
- MP‑D pilot: **20–22** sources live; median request‑to‑connect SLT **< 24h**; first partner SLA trend readout
- XAI‑2: export coverage **≥ 98.8%**; counterfactual hints **≥ 94%**; export p95 **≤ 140ms**
- FS‑v2 MVP‑3: blended top‑k across **5–6** sources; quality delta **≥ +4%** ctr@5 on pilot set; fail‑safe validated; **decision memo drafted**
- XAI‑2.1: **300+** gated sessions; a11y pass; **decision memo signed** (continue → M1 or park)
- Metering: **quarter‑close variance ≤ 0.25%**; CFO pack delivered & signed
- Onboarding: **+2–3** tenants live; zero policy blocks at go‑live

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **FS GA regressions at scale** → strict alarms; staged fallbacks; A/B single‑index; rollback scripts.
- **Predictive misuse** → quotas; sandbox; rollback drills; exemplar guidance.
- **MP‑D license/regulatory drift** → packet checksums; SLA tracker; ombuds exports.
- **XAI latency spikes** → warmers; retry windows; bucketed alerts; back‑pressure.
- **FS‑v2 instability** → staging only; fail‑safe; adapter contract tests; decision gate.
- **Metering drift** → rotation rehearsal; alarms; Finance/CFO co‑review.
- **End‑of‑quarter fatigue** → smaller WIP; automations; escalations early.
