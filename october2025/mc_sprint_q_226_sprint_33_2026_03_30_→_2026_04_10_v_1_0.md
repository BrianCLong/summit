# MC Sprint — Q2’26 / Sprint 33 (2026‑03‑30 → 2026‑04‑10)
**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2026-03-30-sprint33-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q2’26 “Scale & Pilotization” (kickoff)

---
## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star
**From Controlled → Scaled & Measured.** Scale **Federated Search (FS)** staged GA to broader cohorts, operationalize **XAI‑2** telemetry and SLOs, continue **Predictive** rollout (or complete remediation) with strong guardrails, expand **Marketplace Discovery (MP‑D)** pilot with opt‑in partners, and strengthen **Metering** for quarterly close. Maintain frictionless **Onboarding Factory v2** and push toil down with runbooks and automation.

**Sprint Goal:** Add capacity while preserving trust: FS to **8+ tenants** under staged GA, Predictive to **+3** tenants (if “go”), MP‑D pilot to **5–8** curated sources, XAI‑2 telemetry baked into SLO stack, and close finance month with signed metering exports.

**Success KPIs:**
- SLO: **0** Sev‑1; burn alarms **< 15m**; p95 (4‑hop/100k) **≤ 0.85s**  
- FS staged GA: **8+ tenants**, e2e p95 **≤ 1.25s**, complaint rate **< 1.3%**, ctr@5 delta ≥ **+5%** vs baseline  
- Predictive rollout (if go): **+3** tenants; audit sampling **≥ 99%**; **0** rollbacks *(or remediation milestones 100% complete if no‑go)*  
- XAI‑2: export coverage **≥ 98%**; counterfactual hints **≥ 90%**; failure bucket rate **< 1%**  
- MP‑D pilot: **5–8** sources with DPIA/license packets; signed request‑to‑connect trails  
- Metering: quarterly close variance **≤ 0.3%**; 100% tenants received scheduled exports  
- Onboarding: **+1** tenant live via factory v2; zero policy blocks at go‑live

---
## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals
### In‑Scope
- **FS staged GA expansion:** cohort 3–4 enablement; regression alarms; fallback runbooks; stitched provenance proof bundles.  
- **Predictive rollout/remediation:** quotas, abuse rules, on‑call playbooks; client‑visible model card 1.4; rollback rehearsal or remediation completion.  
- **XAI‑2 ops & SLOs:** exporter reliability, telemetry dashboards, a11y copy, opt‑out accounting; SLOs for export latency & coverage.  
- **MP‑D pilot expansion:** curate sources with license/DPIA packets; audit trail exports; content QA.  
- **Metering quarterly close:** signer rotation rehearsal; drift alarms; finance review; invoice preview batch.  
- **Onboarding factory v2:** self‑serve packs; policy sim; evidence artifacts.  
- **Ops hygiene:** warmers v3 experiments; access reviews; noisy‑alert pruning.

### Non‑Goals
- MP‑D transactions/billing.  
- FS open GA for all tenants (staged ramps continue).

## 9) Risks & Mitigations

- **Predictive misuse** → quotas; sandbox; rollback drills; exemplar guidance.  
- **XAI exporter flakiness** → retries; failure buckets; SLO alarms.  
- **License drift** → registry checksums; clause previews; ombuds packet.  
- **Metering drift** → rotation rehearsal; alarms; Finance co‑review.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- FS p95, ctr@5 delta, complaint rate; predictive audit sampling (≥99%); XAI coverage/latency SLOs; MP‑D pilot activity; onboarding throughput; metering variance (≤0.3%); burn alarms (<15m).  
- Weekly: burndown, scope ledger, blocker aging.
