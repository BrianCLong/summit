# The B.I.Z Workstream – Revenue, Partnerships & GTM (Sprint 2025-10-01 → 2025-10-15)

**Owner:** Felix (VP Sales, BizDev & Growth)  
**Scope:** Pipeline creation, capture, partner ecosystem, pricing/packaging, GTM assets, and product feedback loop – aligned to Summit / IntelGraph / Maestro Conductor platform (“Summit”).  
**Operating Principles:** Evidence-first, compliant-by-design, land→expand motions, partner-led acceleration.  

---

## 0) Assumptions & Data Needed Next
> I could not open the uploaded repos/sprint zips in this environment due to a processing timeout. I’m proceeding with standard Summit patterns and our stated ICPs. Please paste (or re-upload smaller subsets of) the following so I can reconcile line-by-line:
- **Repo map:** packages/modules, README(s), security/compliance docs, API/SDK entrypoints, connectors list, deployment patterns.
- **Sprint board export:** backlog, in-progress, done; owners; due dates; definitions-of-done; linked epics.
- **Open deals list:** account, segment, stage, ARR, champion, paper process, blockers, target date.
- **Partner roster:** primes/SIs, ISVs, MSPs, research labs; status; next actions.
- **Compliance status:** CMMC posture, FedRAMP path, SBOM/SLSA artifacts, DLP/OPA configs.

Until then, the plan below closes common GTM gaps and aligns to our mission/compliance posture.

---

## 1) What “Good” Looks Like by Oct 15, 2025 (Outcomes)
- **Pipeline** ≥ 3× target across Gov/Defense, Primes, Regulated Enterprise, NGOs; ≥ 10 net-new qualified opps (CHAMP/MEDDICC) with named exec sponsors and success criteria.
- **Partner Ecosystem:** 3 signed teaming/Resell/Referral MOUs (at least 1 prime, 1 SI/ISV), joint pursuit list started.
- **Land Offers:** Standard **6–12 week paid pilot** package published (security-ready), with TCO/ROI model and success plan template.
- **Evidence Pack:** 1 public case brief + 1 private technical validation note; demo environment scripted and recorded.
- **Pricing/Packaging:** Role-based + usage-tiered SKUs finalized with a 2-year ramp + success-based milestone option.
- **Compliance-by-Design:** “Field Kit” linkable pack (SBOM pointer, data handling, responsible-use) embedded in all proposals.
- **Product Loop:** Top-5 revenue-impact features validated with Product/Eng; each tagged with $$ impact & opp IDs.

---

## 2) Gaps Identified (within my ambit)
1. **ICP→Messaging Fit:** Need sharper problem/mission mapping by segment; lack of role-based outcomes & proof points.
2. **Sales Artifacts Debt:** Missing (or outdated) capability statement, 1-pager, pilot offer sheet, and outreach kits.
3. **Pricing/Packaging:** Inconsistent; no clear land→expand path, no partner margin policy.
4. **Partner Motion:** No standard “better together” diagrams or joint pursuit ritual; unclear MOU boilerplate.
5. **Compliance Evidence:** Scattered; SBOM/SLSA and DLP/OPA proof not consistently bundled in proposals.
6. **Capture Discipline (Gov/Primes):** Need capture briefs, funding lines, procurement paths, and 30-60-90 pursuit plans.
7. **Product Feedback → Revenue:** Feature asks not tied to $$, stage movement, or cycle-time impact.
8. **Enablement:** No repeatable demo script, evaluation harness outline, or sandbox guidance for prospects.

---

## 3) Sprint Plan (2025-10-01 → 2025-10-15)
**Cadence:** Daily standup (15m), EOD pipeline delta; Wed Product Loop sync; Fri Partner sync.  
**Definition of Done:** Artifacts versioned; templates templatized; baseline metrics captured; owner assigned; in CRM.
