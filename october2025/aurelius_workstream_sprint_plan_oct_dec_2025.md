awesome—thanks for the trust. I pulled apart the October pack and the full `summit` repo you provided (zips), mapped the active sprint scaffolds (IntelGraph + Maestro Conductor + Company OS), and synthesized a workstream that both fits your cadence and closes gaps I see “around the corners.”

Below is my **first-response package** in your requested format, plus a tight kickoff prompt that plugs straight into our cadence.

---

# 1) Mission Decomposition

**Mission:** Convert Summit’s Q4 plan into provably _defensible_, _operationally hard_, and _commercially licensable_ tech—centered on: (a) provenance-first execution, (b) cost/perf guardrails, (c) bitemporal IntelGraph, (d) Maestro Conductor GA runtime & UI shell, (e) audit-ready governance.

**Workstreams (mine, integrated):**

- **W1 — Prov-First Core GA:** Provenance ledger + attestations, policy compiler, verifiable ER pipeline, export/consent gates.
- **W2 — IntelGraph Hardening:** Schema registry + bitemporal time-travel, NL→Cypher, GraphRAG guardrails, adjudication UI.
- **W3 — Cost Guard + RL Tuner:** Request shaping, cache strategy, autoscale policies, RL controller w/ safe fallback.
- **W4 — Conductor Shell & Observability:** Tri-pane UI, action ledger, SLOs/p95/p99, red-team & policy-fuzzer.
- **W5 — IP & Compliance Railguards:** Patent scaffolds, FTO notes, SPDX/SBOM, SLSA provenance, data governance.

---

# 2) Novelty Hunt Plan (hypotheses)

- **H1: “Prov-contracts”** — Compile _policy + consent + data lineage_ into an _on-path executable contract_ (OPA/ABAC + PII gates) that emits signed proof objects and blocks side-channels.
- **H2: “Bitemporal ER-adjudication”** — Joint entity resolution over valid-time + transaction-time with _adjudication explanations_ (XAI overlays) that are _prov-verifiable_.
- **H3: “Cost Guard RL-safe”** — A constrained RL policy for autoscale/cache/HPA that _never_ violates SLO/Spend bounds; with formal guards + rollback.
- **H4: “Prov-verified LLM IO”** — Bound LLM graph ops (NL→Cypher, GraphRAG) by _prov scopes_ + _data-use purposes_; every answer carries a verifiable evidence bundle.
- **H5: “Policy Fuzzer”** — Coverage-guided fuzzing of Rego + data-path combinatorics to surface privacy/policy bypasses pre-GA.

---

# 3) Prior-Art Shortlist (delta focus)

1. OPA/Rego (policy) → **Delta:** on-path _prov-contract_ compiler + proof artifact schema.
2. Google Zanzibar/SpiceDB (authz) → **Delta:** add _consent/purpose_, bitemporal edges, and evidence binding.
3. LakeFS / Delta Lake (lineage) → **Delta:** _transaction-time + valid-time_ ER with adjudication UI.
4. K8s HPA/VPA (autoscaling) → **Delta:** _SLO/Spend-constrained RL_ with formal guardrails and prov traces.
5. GraphRAG/NL2Cypher (LLM) → **Delta:** _scope-aware compilation_ and _proof-bundled responses_.
6. SLSA in supply chain → **Delta:** unify _runtime data-use provenance_ with build provenance.

(_I’ll maintain `/ip/prior_art.csv` with precise cites + claim deltas._)

---

# 4) Architecture Sketch

**Core idea:** every data-touching action emits **EVIDENCE** (hash-chained, signed), and every decision is checked against a compiled **PROV-CONTRACT**.

```
[User/Service] → [Conductor Actions] → [Policy Compiler → PROV-CONTRACT]
       │                                   │
       ├──> [IntelGraph API] ── NL→Cypher ─┼──> [Evidence Emitter ⟂ Audit Bus]
       │                                   │
       ├──> [Cost Guard] ← metrics/SLO ----┘
       │
       └──> [Prov Ledger (WORM+hash chain)] ← [Policy Fuzzer, Red Team]
```

**Key components (repos/dirs I’ll touch):**

- `sprint-kits/proof-first-core-ga/` → APIs, charts, CI, policy export.
- `project_management/epics/*` → epics/issues wiring.
- `services/{prov-ledger, er-service, cost-guard}/` → service kernels.
- `conductor-ui/` & `apps/*` → tri-pane shell + overlays.
- `policy-fuzzer/` → coverage-guided engine and seeds.
- `observability/`, `monitoring/`, `policy/` → SLOs, rules, OPA bundles.

---

# 5) Experiment Plan

**Datasets/fixtures:** synthetic PII/customer graph, seeded ER conflicts, cost/load traces, policy suites with expected outcomes.

**Metrics & KPIs**

- _Prov:_ % actions with valid evidence, verification latency, chain integrity.
- _Graph:_ ER F1, adjudication latency, time-travel correctness.
- _Cost/Perf:_ p95/p99 latency, cache hit-rate, $/1k ops, SLO miss rate.
- _Policy:_ rule coverage, bypass rate (should → 0), mean time-to-detect.
- _LLM:_ NL→Cypher accuracy, GraphRAG groundedness (attributed sources).

**Ablations**

- RL controller on/off; safe-guards on/off
- Provenance enforcement on/off
- Bitemporal vs uni-temporal queries
- Policy-fuzzer seeds vs random

---

# 6) Patent Angles (candidate claims)

- **Independent (method):** Compiling data-use _prov-contracts_ that gate execution and emit verifiable evidence bundles for each action and LLM output.
- **Independent (system/CRM):** Bitemporal ER-adjudication graph service that generates policy-bound explanations and anchors them in a hash-chained ledger.
- **Dependent:** purpose-limited scopes; consent revision propagation; RL safety envelopes; rollback + notarized deltas; XAI overlays; SLSA+runtime provenance unification; cache/LLM scope-aware compilation; policy-fuzzer guided by coverage and lineage graphs.

(_/ip/draft_spec.md and claims.md will be delivered with ≥2 indep + ≥8 dep claims._)

---

# 7) Commercialization Hooks

- **Licensable units:** Prov-contract compiler, Prov-ledger service, Cost Guard controller, Policy Fuzzer, IntelGraph bitemporal module, Conductor tri-pane UI kit, Audit SDK.
- **Targets:** Regulated SaaS, Fin/Health, Gov/Defense, Data platforms, Graph DB vendors.
- **Pricing:** per-core (runtime), per-action (prov), per-seat (UI), per-cluster (policy/cost guard), OEM/royalty for DB vendors.

---

# 8) Risks & Mitigations

- **Integration sprawl:** lock interfaces + contract tests.
- **Policy regressions:** policy-fuzzer + CI gates + golden bundles.
- **RL instability:** constraints + shadow mode + rollback + invariants.
- **Prov overhead:** batched signing, async attest + p95 budgets.
- **Data governance:** PII scanners, redactors, consent scopes; DPIA templates.

---

# 9) Delivery Plan & Milestones (DoD-aligned)

**Cadence anchors (matches your plan):**

- **Daily:** 15-min dispatch + p95/p99/err heatmap, block/risk.
- **Weekly:** Portfolio & Risk; demo _prov evidence_ diff; burn-up vs SLO.
- **Bi-weekly sprints (2w):** releasable increments with _Release Gate_ (tests/docs/disclosure/owner dashboards).
- **Monthly:** Strategy + Metrics pack; IP update (claims churn).
- **Quarterly:** Board brief; roadmap reprioritization.

**Sprint 1 (Oct 6–17)** _Prov-First Core GA — foundations_

## Gaps I’m closing (from the October pack & repo)

- **Evidence unification:** multiple partial ledger/policy artifacts—no single _proof bundle_ format; I’ll define/standardize and wire CI verification.
- **Scope-aware NL→Cypher:** scaffolds exist but lack _purpose/consent_ pruning; I’ll implement compiler passes that honor prov-contracts.
- **Autoscale “safe policy”:** tuning tasks present; missing _formal safe envelope_ + rollback drills; I’ll add invariants + shadow rollout.
- **Policy regression surface:** policy-fuzzer not integrated into CI; I’ll add coverage gates, seed corpora, and bypass detectors.
- **SLSA↔Runtime link:** supply-chain provenance present; I’ll connect build attestations with runtime _data-use_ evidence.

---

## Next-Steps Kanban (week 1)

- [ ] Land `/spec/prov-contracts.md` + evidence schema (v0).
- [ ] Implement evidence emitter + signer; CLI `prov verify`.
- [ ] Wire OPA bundle build + policy pack tests in CI.
- [ ] NL→Cypher compiler skeleton + scope pruning (tests).
- [ ] Cost Guard controller (shadow) + invariants + rollback script.
- [ ] Observability dashboards (p95/p99/SLO) + alerts.
- [ ] Draft `/ip/draft_spec.md` with claim map.
- [ ] SPDX/SBOM generation in CI.

If you want, I’ll spin the initial branches/PRs and push the skeletons with owners and CODEOWNERS set to your cadence.
