[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Mar 3 – Mar 14, 2026 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Natural Language Explainability API (ExplainWhy) + Multilingual Stability Inference — universal trust, any language.
- **Workstream Theme:** Ask Why, Understand Always — human queries meet graph reasons in any language.
- **Target Output:** ExplainWhy NL API, cross-lingual prompt classifier, clarity parity baseline.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE
- Graph explainers and prompt shaping work — but only in English.
- Decision-makers increasingly need **plain-language answers** to “Why this?” in their own languages.
- Stable interaction with IntelGraph must cross linguistic borders without semantic drift.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Mar 3–14)
1. **ExplainWhy API**
   - Accepts natural language “why?” prompts (e.g., "Why was this claim connected?").  
   - Returns traced logic path in plain, justified output.
2. **Multilingual Prompt Classifier**
   - Extend prompt risk classifier to at least 5 high-priority languages.  
   - Flag translation-induced ambiguity, drift, or risk.
3. **Semantic Drift Guardrails**
   - Hash prompt intent pre/post translation → detect divergence.  
   - Alert on high-drift mismatches.
4. **Clarity Parity Metrics**
   - Compare analyst comprehension & override rates across languages.  
   - Identify underperforming translation zones.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)
- Language-specific canonical prompt libraries  
- Trust calibration UI per locale

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE
- **Sources:** Prompt logs, translation APIs, ExplainX trace trees.
- **Assumptions:** Translation layer supports round-trip hashing.
- **Uncertainty:** Clarity scoring models may bias toward source language.
- **Verification:**
  - Multilingual test set  
  - Prompt→intent hash consistency audit  
  - ExplainWhy QA by native speakers

## CADENCE PLAN (Q1 '26)

| Layer         | Cadence               | Responsible Artifact                             |
|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Daily         | Why? API Logs         | Query types, Response Latency, Explain Clarity   |
| Weekly        | Translation Drift Sync| Prompt Intent Hash Diff Stats                    |
| Biweekly (83M)| Language QA Loop      | Native Review Findings, Clarity Deltas           |
| Monthly       | Trust Parity Brief    | Drift Disparity, Override Hotspots               |
| Quarterly     | Multilingual Coverage | Language Expansion Roadmap, Localized Explainers |

**Next Steps:**
- ExplainWhy API beta live (Mar 5)  
- Classifier multilingual mode online (Mar 8)  
- Clarity baseline across locales (Mar 13)
