## 6) Risks & Mitigations

- **Event fatigue/low attendance** → Co‑market to partner lists; offer on‑demand replay; tight CTAs.
- **Security stall** → Office hours + pre‑answered FAQ; CFK gate; sample audit logs.
- **Pilot scoping creep** → Smallest viable scope; milestone credits; rollback plan.
- **Attribution gaps** → Mandatory partner tagging; dashboard review in Fri sync.
