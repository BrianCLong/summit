**Email – Expansion**  
_Subject:_ Scale [TEAM/PROGRAM] with policy‑gated AI  
[Name], your team is hitting [usage milestone]. We can unlock [new role/module] and cut cycle time another [X%]. Quick QBR to map it?

**Email – Multi‑Year**  
_Subject:_ Lock capacity + price‑hold for [FY26–FY27]  
Based on your roadmap, a [24/36]‑month plan reduces total cost by [~Y%] with milestone credits. Want me to send the ladder?

## 6) Risks & Mitigations

- **Year‑end procurement bottlenecks** → Early vehicle alignment, pre‑approved clauses, milestone‑based acceptance.
- **Partner channel conflict** → Deal reg + territory carve‑outs; weekly triage.
- **Security approvals stretch** → CFK v1.2, office hours; redaction presets and audit‑log exemplars.
- **Expansion resistance** → Usage analytics + value scorecards; champion enablement; phased ramp.
