Just flipped public. Dig into where we are and where we need to be. Provide full specs, PRD for MVP-2 and GA based on where we are, what we need, and where we're going, 360 degrees.

IntelGraph Platform — Current State, Roadmap \& Product Requirements Document (PRD) for MVP-2 and GA

***

## 1. Current State (as of public release v2025.09.30-golden)

IntelGraph is a production-ready AI-augmented intelligence analysis platform focused on graph analytics, real-time multi-user collaboration, and enterprise security. The platform is solidly finishing MVP-1 with:

- Fully functional core investigative workflow and entity-relationship graph management
- Powerful AI/ML extraction engines (OCR, object detection, NLP, speech-to-text, semantic embeddings)
- Advanced security controls (JWT, RBAC, OPA policies, encryption, audit logging)
- Rich observability stack with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana
- Developer-friendly Dockerized deployment with CI/CD pipelines and comprehensive testing (unit, e2e, performance, security)
- Responsive and accessible React UI with Cytoscape.js visualization and AI-driven natural language query assistant
- Four coordinated databases: Neo4j (graph), PostgreSQL (metadata), TimescaleDB (metrics), Redis (cache/session)

***

## 2. Where We Need to Be: MVP-2 \& GA Vision

The transition from MVP-1 to MVP-2 and ultimately to General Availability (GA) entails solidifying enterprise readiness, expanding features, improving performance and scalability, and polishing UX. The objectives span from technical robustness to operational excellence.

## 3. MVP-2 Product Requirements

### Core Deliverables

1. **Enterprise-Grade Scale \& Performance**
    - Horizontal scaling architecture for backend and AI services (Kubernetes optimization)
    - Database tuning and auto-scaling strategies (Neo4j clustering, TimescaleDB distributed deployments)
    - Enhanced caching and query performance with persisted queries \& aggressive cache invalidation policies
2. **Advanced Security \& Compliance**
    - Full SSO/SAML/OAuth integration
    - Enhanced audit logging with anomaly detection for suspicious activity
    - Data loss prevention (DLP) features \& enhanced encryption key management
    - Formal SOC 2 Type II and GDPR audit preparation workflows
3. **Expanded Data Federation \& Integration**
    - Support for more external standards (e.g., additional OSINT feeds, extended STIX/TAXII versions)
    - Real-time federated query with additional API connectors (REST, gRPC, Kafka streams)
    - Data provenance and lineage tracking
4. **Improved User Experience**
    - Enhanced graph visualization UI features (advanced filtering, dynamic graph summaries)
    - Multi-lingual NLP support \& customizable AI Copilot capabilities
    - Workflow automation and investigation templating features
    - Collaboration tools: integrated messaging, commenting, and annotation system
5. **Operational \& DevOps Enhancements**
    - Enterprise-grade deployment options (Helm charts for multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters)
    - Comprehensive disaster recovery automation with DR drills integration
    - Fine-grained role customization UI for administrators
    - Improved observability: distributed tracing dashboards and automated root cause analytics
6. **Quality Assurance \& Documentation**
    - End-to-end encrypted communication compliance testing
    - Performance benchmarking suite and load testing automation
    - Complete updated technical and user documentation, API versioning strategy

***

## 4. General Availability (GA) Product Requirements

1. **Production-Ready Stability \& Support**
    - Formal SLAs and uptime guarantees with built-in self-healing
    - Full multi-region/cloud deployment support and disaster recovery failover
    - Comprehensive logging and audit trails with integration to SIEM platforms
2. **Enterprise Governance \& Regulatory Compliance**
    - Data residency configurations and certification (FedRAMP, HIPAA where applicable)
    - Built-in data anonymization and PII scrubbing workflows
    - Policy management console with audit-ready compliance reporting
3. **Extensibility \& Ecosystem**
    - Plugin and extension framework for third-party AI/analytics components
    - SDKs and API extensions for custom integrations and automation
    - Marketplace or registry for reusable investigation templates and AI models
4. **User Experience Excellence**
    - Fully polished UI/UX with onboarding wizards and in-app tooling guidance
    - Advanced AI Copilot features: proactive insights, predictive analytics, and decision support
    - Mobile client improvements and offline investigation support
5. **Enterprise Support \& Training**
    - Formal customer support channels, training modules, and professional services engagement
    - Release management process with backward compatibility guarantees and legacy data migration tools
