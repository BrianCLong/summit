[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Dec 16 – Dec 27, 2025 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Real-Time Observability + Adversarial Resilience — live query capture, ExplainX Red Team ops, and audit fencing.
- **Workstream Theme:** Trace Everything, Test Defensively, Trust What Holds.
- **Target Output:** Live query ingest, ExplainX RT attack logs, alertable audit diffs.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE
- ExplainX UI and causal map have launched; passive insight is strong, but **live flow** and **offensive testing** are now essential.
- Prompt abuse, query manipulation, and edge-jump fuzzing must be modeled.
- Analysts need both telemetry and red cell perspective to assert trust in the output.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Dec 16–27)
1. **Real-Time Query Capture (RTQC)**
   - Capture NL queries + Cypher + graph result as atomic chain.  
   - Push to live ExplainX Trace panel with latency + decision tags.
2. **ExplainX Red Team Test Harness**
   - Inject adversarial prompts, malformed joins, time-boxed edge fuzzing.  
   - Score explainability failure and alert threshold crossings.
3. **Audit Fence Layer**
   - Compare intent (prompt) vs result; enforce stability boundaries.  
   - Emit alerts on hallucinated joins or lineage-free exports.
4. **Analyst Threat Review Panel**
   - Allow analyst to triage Red Team triggered alerts.  
   - Attach feedback to training diff set.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)
- Stability classifier integration
- Trace path hash lock & alert correlation engine

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE
- **Sources:** RTQC logs, red team prompt packs, audit diff anomalies.
- **Assumptions:** Query latency SLOs < 1.5s; audit latency < 3s.
- **Uncertainty:** Red team prompt variety needs expansion.
- **Verification:**
  - Real-time capture test  
  - Red team replay diff  
  - Audit alert correlation

## CADENCE PLAN (Q4 '25)

| Layer         | Cadence         | Responsible Artifact                             |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Daily         | Query Telemetry  | RTQC stream, latency logs, alert hits           |
| Weekly        | Red Cell Report  | Prompt Pack Stats, ExplainX Fails               |
| Biweekly (83M)| Audit Sync       | Join Drift, Hallucination Tagger Stats          |
| Monthly       | Resilience Brief | Stability Failures, Analyst Interventions       |
| Quarterly     | Kill-Chain Drill | Prompt-to-join-to-export anomaly maps           |

**Next Steps:**
- Enable RTQC Live Stream (Dec 17)  
- Begin Red Team Cycle-2 (Dec 18)  
- Launch Analyst Threat Panel alpha (Dec 23)
