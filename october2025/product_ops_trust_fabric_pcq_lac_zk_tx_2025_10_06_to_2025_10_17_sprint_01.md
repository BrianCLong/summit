# 🚀 Workstream Packet — Product Ops • Trust Fabric (PCQ • LAC • ZK‑TX)
**Cadence:** 2‑week sprint (Oct 6–Oct 17, 2025)
**Ordinal:** Sprint 01 (workstream‑scoped)
**Role:** Product Operations / Program & Scrum Mastery (Elara Voss)
**Streams aligned:** Graph Core, Copilot/XAI, Security & Governance, DevEx/Tooling, Infra/Helm

---

## 0) TL;DR
We will ship **verifiable trust primitives** to move the platform from *spec’d* to *operational*:
1) **Proof‑Carrying Queries (PCQ)** end‑to‑end with an **external verifier** & golden fixtures.
2) **License/Authority Compiler (LAC)** gatekeeping queries/exports by policy, with **dry‑run simulator**.
3) **Zero‑Knowledge Trust Exchange (ZK‑TX)** MVP for cross‑tenant **deconfliction proofs** (no PII egress).

This sprint closes critical gaps in provenance integrity, compliance‑by‑construction, and alliance‑safe collaboration. All deliverables are **green tests, docs, and demo paths**.

---

## 1) Gap Assessment (Repo & Active Sprints)
**Observed gaps** (from docs/backlog/infra structure & previous sprint intents):
- **PCQ**
  - a) Verifier exists as proto but **no reproducible golden path** (fixtures + CLI + CI gate).
  - b) **Model metadata** (hyperparams/seed) not uniformly embedded in manifests.
  - c) **Cross‑language determinism** for graph metrics not locked; tolerance windows undefined.
- **LAC** (License/Authority Compiler)
  - d) Policy specs exist, but **bytecode intercepts** aren’t in the query planner hot path.
  - e) **Policy simulation** (diff vs. historical access) lacks UI & regression corpus.
  - f) **Reason‑for‑access prompts** not wired to audit envelopes.
- **ZK‑TX**
  - g) Hashing/pepper protocols defined, but **ZK range/set proofs** not integrated with tenancy boundary.
  - h) **False‑positive insurance / appeal flow** unspecified; partner handshake playbook missing.
- **Ops/DevEx**
  - i) **One‑command demo** (dev → stage) not repeatable; Helm charts lack smoke test hooks.
  - j) **Chaos/DR drills** not scripted for trust fabric services; no SLO dashboards pinned.

**Dependencies/risks**
- Shared schemas (provenance manifest & policy objects) are **version‑drifting** across services.
- Query planner & Copilot have **incomplete guardrail bindings** (LAC must block at parse & plan).
- Cross‑tenant messaging bus for ZK‑TX needs **isolated broker + audit sink**.

---

## 2) Sprint Goal & Non‑Negotiables
**Sprint Goal:**
> “Stand up **Trust Fabric v0.1**: verifiable results, executable policies, and safe alliance checks—**demo‑able, documented, and CI‑enforced**.”

**Definition of Done (DoD) — This Sprint**
- All three pillars (PCQ, LAC, ZK‑TX) have: runnable service(s) + CLI + API + **green test packs** + docs + **demo script**.
- CI gates: **PCQ replay** must pass; **LAC policy gate** must block unsafe queries; **ZK‑TX** must produce/verify proofs.
- Helm values + smoke tests enable **one‑command ephemeral env** for the demo.

**Out of Scope (but staged):** PCA for federated simulators, advanced narrative proofing, partner legal templates.

---

## 3) Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)
- **O1: Ship verifiable queries**  
  **KR1.1** External verifier reproduces 5 golden cases ≤ 60s each with numeric tolerance windows.  
  **KR1.2** 100% of materialized analytics include model card hashes & seeds in provenance.  
- **O2: Enforce policy by construction**  
  **KR2.1** LAC blocks 100% of unsafe ops on a 50‑case policy corpus (no false negatives).  
  **KR2.2** Policy diff simulator generates impact reports in < 5s for 1k historical queries.  
- **O3: Enable alliance‑safe deconfliction**  
  **KR3.1** ZK‑TX MVP proves overlap/no‑overlap across two tenants with zero raw PII transfer.  
  **KR3.2** Partner handshake runbook + appeal path published; demo completes in < 10 min.

---

## 4) Scope — Epics, Stories, Acceptance
### Epic A — Proof‑Carrying Queries (PCQ)
- **A1. Provenance Manifest v1.1**  
  *Stories:* unify schema, embed model hyperparams, RNG seed, data hashes.  
  *AC:* every result bundle validates via JSON Schema; missing fields fail build.
- **A2. External Verifier CLI**  
  *Stories:* `prov-verify run --fixtures <case>`; deterministic replay; tolerance config per metric.  
  *AC:* 5 goldens pass locally & in CI; failure surfaces diff of inputs/transforms/versions.
- **A3. Repro Tolerance Windows**  
  *Stories:* define tolerances for centrality, K‑shortest paths, community metrics.  
  *AC:* doc table published; CI uses same thresholds.

### Epic B — License/Authority Compiler (LAC)
- **B1. Planner Hook‑in**  
  *Stories:* parse policies → compile → inject into query planner; unsafe ops un‑executable.  
  *AC:* blocked queries show actionable reason; audit writes policy/authority ID.
- **B2. Policy Diff Simulator**  
  *Stories:* dry‑run a policy change vs. historical queries; produce dashboard & CSV export.  
  *AC:* 50‑case corpus simulated under 3 policy variants < 5s each.
- **B3. Reason‑for‑Access Prompting**  
  *Stories:* UX modal + API; reason captured, signed, and bound to audit record.  
  *AC:* 100% coverage on sensitive views; audit search by reason substring works.

### Epic C — Zero‑Knowledge Trust Exchange (ZK‑TX) MVP
- **C1. Pepper & Salt Protocols**  
  *Stories:* per‑tenant salts; rotating pepper; envelope format; key rotation doc.  
  *AC:* cryptographic review checklist passes; rotation demoed.
- **C2. Set/Range Proof Service**  
  *Stories:* build service for overlap/no‑overlap proofs; REST + gRPC; rate‑limit & audit.  
  *AC:* two‑tenant demo passes with real proofs; logs contain no raw selectors.
- **C3. Partner Handshake & Appeals**  
  *Stories:* write runbook: onboarding, FP insurance pool, appeal workflow.  
  *AC:* tabletop exercise performed; artifacts published.

---

## 8) Backlog — Sprint 01 (Committed)
**PCQ**  
- [ ] Manifest v1.1 (model card hash, RNG seed, data checksum tree).  
- [ ] Verifier CLI with 5 golden fixtures; CI gate.  
- [ ] Tolerance table & docs (centrality/path/community).

**LAC**  
- [ ] Parser → compiler → planner intercepts.  
- [ ] Policy diff simulator + dashboard & CSV.  
- [ ] Reason‑for‑access prompting bound to audit.

**ZK‑TX**  
- [ ] Pepper/salt protocols + rotation demo.  
- [ ] Set/range proof microservice + REST/gRPC.  
- [ ] Partner handshake/appeals runbook.

**Ops/DevEx**  
- [ ] Helm smoke tests; ephemeral env script.  
- [ ] SLO dashboards (p95 query <1.5s; proof gen <2s; verifier ≤60s/case).  
- [ ] Chaos drill: fail proof‑service; auto‑degrade to cached attestations.

---

## 9) Acceptance Packs
- **PCQ Golden Fixtures:** 5 labeled cases covering link/path/community metrics with expected manifests.  
- **LAC Corpus:** 50 historical queries with mixed policy outcomes; expected block/allow & reason strings.  
- **ZK‑TX Demo:** Two tenants, 1 overlap, 1 no‑overlap scenario; audit log review checklist.

---

## 10) Test Strategy
- **Unit/Contract:** manifest validation, compiler bytecode, proof APIs.  
- **E2E:** ingest → analyze → PCQ verify → policy block/allow → ZK‑TX outcome.  
- **Load:** verifier on 10 parallel cases; proof service QPS spikes.  
- **Security:** secret hygiene, pepper rotation, authz on proof endpoints.  
- **Chaos:** intentional proof‑service outage; verify graceful degradation and alerting.

## 11) Architecture (ASCII Sketch)
```
[Client/Copilot]
    |  (queries with policy context)
[Query Planner] --(policy bytecode)--> [LAC Gate]
    | allowed plans
[Analytics Engine] --(manifests)--> [Provenance Ledger]
    | results + manifests
[Verifier CLI/CI] <----- fixtures -----> [Replay DAG]

[Tenants A,B] --(salted selectors)--> [ZK‑TX Service] --(proofs)--> [Audit Sink]
```

---

## 12) Risks & Mitigations
- **R1: Determinism drift across platforms.**  
  *Mitigation:* tolerance windows, seed control, pinned libs; doc exact deltas.
- **R2: Policy false positives blocking valid work.**  
  *Mitigation:* diff simulator + appeal path; staged ‘monitor’ mode before ‘enforce’.
- **R3: ZK‑TX crypto misconfig.**  
  *Mitigation:* checklist, key ceremonies, rotation demo; external review.
- **R4: Demo fragility.**  
  *Mitigation:* ephemeral env script, seeded data, smoke tests on deploy.

---

## 13) Metrics & Dashboards
- **PCQ:** % artifacts with manifests; verifier pass rate; avg replay time.  
- **LAC:** policy blocks vs. allows; false positive rate; simulator latency.  
- **ZK‑TX:** proofs generated/day; FP appeals; time‑to‑resolution.  
- **Ops:** SLOs (p95 latency), error budgets, cost per insight.

---

## 14) Release Notes (Planned v0.1)
- PCQ manifests v1.1 + external verifier CLI.  
- LAC planner enforcement + diff simulator + reason‑for‑access UX.  
- ZK‑TX MVP (set/range proofs) + partner runbook.  
- Helm smoke + ephemeral demo env; SLO dashboards; chaos drill #1.
