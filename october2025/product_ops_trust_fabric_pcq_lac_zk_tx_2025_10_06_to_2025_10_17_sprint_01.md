# üöÄ Workstream Packet ‚Äî Product Ops ‚Ä¢ Trust Fabric (PCQ ‚Ä¢ LAC ‚Ä¢ ZK‚ÄëTX)

**Cadence:** 2‚Äëweek sprint (Oct 6‚ÄìOct 17, 2025)
**Ordinal:** Sprint 01 (workstream‚Äëscoped)
**Role:** Product Operations / Program & Scrum Mastery (Elara Voss)
**Streams aligned:** Graph Core, Copilot/XAI, Security & Governance, DevEx/Tooling, Infra/Helm

---

## 0) TL;DR

We will ship **verifiable trust primitives** to move the platform from _spec‚Äôd_ to _operational_:

1. **Proof‚ÄëCarrying Queries (PCQ)** end‚Äëto‚Äëend with an **external verifier** & golden fixtures.
2. **License/Authority Compiler (LAC)** gatekeeping queries/exports by policy, with **dry‚Äërun simulator**.
3. **Zero‚ÄëKnowledge Trust Exchange (ZK‚ÄëTX)** MVP for cross‚Äëtenant **deconfliction proofs** (no PII egress).

This sprint closes critical gaps in provenance integrity, compliance‚Äëby‚Äëconstruction, and alliance‚Äësafe collaboration. All deliverables are **green tests, docs, and demo paths**.

---

## 1) Gap Assessment (Repo & Active Sprints)

**Observed gaps** (from docs/backlog/infra structure & previous sprint intents):

- **PCQ**
  - a) Verifier exists as proto but **no reproducible golden path** (fixtures + CLI + CI gate).
  - b) **Model metadata** (hyperparams/seed) not uniformly embedded in manifests.
  - c) **Cross‚Äëlanguage determinism** for graph metrics not locked; tolerance windows undefined.
- **LAC** (License/Authority Compiler)
  - d) Policy specs exist, but **bytecode intercepts** aren‚Äôt in the query planner hot path.
  - e) **Policy simulation** (diff vs. historical access) lacks UI & regression corpus.
  - f) **Reason‚Äëfor‚Äëaccess prompts** not wired to audit envelopes.
- **ZK‚ÄëTX**
  - g) Hashing/pepper protocols defined, but **ZK range/set proofs** not integrated with tenancy boundary.
  - h) **False‚Äëpositive insurance / appeal flow** unspecified; partner handshake playbook missing.
- **Ops/DevEx**
  - i) **One‚Äëcommand demo** (dev ‚Üí stage) not repeatable; Helm charts lack smoke test hooks.
  - j) **Chaos/DR drills** not scripted for trust fabric services; no SLO dashboards pinned.

**Dependencies/risks**

- Shared schemas (provenance manifest & policy objects) are **version‚Äëdrifting** across services.
- Query planner & Copilot have **incomplete guardrail bindings** (LAC must block at parse & plan).
- Cross‚Äëtenant messaging bus for ZK‚ÄëTX needs **isolated broker + audit sink**.

---

## 2) Sprint Goal & Non‚ÄëNegotiables

**Sprint Goal:**

> ‚ÄúStand up **Trust Fabric v0.1**: verifiable results, executable policies, and safe alliance checks‚Äî**demo‚Äëable, documented, and CI‚Äëenforced**.‚Äù

**Definition of Done (DoD) ‚Äî This Sprint**

- All three pillars (PCQ, LAC, ZK‚ÄëTX) have: runnable service(s) + CLI + API + **green test packs** + docs + **demo script**.
- CI gates: **PCQ replay** must pass; **LAC policy gate** must block unsafe queries; **ZK‚ÄëTX** must produce/verify proofs.
- Helm values + smoke tests enable **one‚Äëcommand ephemeral env** for the demo.

**Out of Scope (but staged):** PCA for federated simulators, advanced narrative proofing, partner legal templates.

---

## 3) Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

- **O1: Ship verifiable queries**  
  **KR1.1** External verifier reproduces 5 golden cases ‚â§ 60s each with numeric tolerance windows.  
  **KR1.2** 100% of materialized analytics include model card hashes & seeds in provenance.
- **O2: Enforce policy by construction**  
  **KR2.1** LAC blocks 100% of unsafe ops on a 50‚Äëcase policy corpus (no false negatives).  
  **KR2.2** Policy diff simulator generates impact reports in < 5s for 1k historical queries.
- **O3: Enable alliance‚Äësafe deconfliction**  
  **KR3.1** ZK‚ÄëTX MVP proves overlap/no‚Äëoverlap across two tenants with zero raw PII transfer.  
  **KR3.2** Partner handshake runbook + appeal path published; demo completes in < 10 min.

## 4) Scope ‚Äî Epics, Stories, Acceptance

### Epic A ‚Äî Proof‚ÄëCarrying Queries (PCQ)

- **A1. Provenance Manifest v1.1**  
  _Stories:_ unify schema, embed model hyperparams, RNG seed, data hashes.  
  _AC:_ every result bundle validates via JSON Schema; missing fields fail build.
- **A2. External Verifier CLI**  
  _Stories:_ `prov-verify run --fixtures <case>`; deterministic replay; tolerance config per metric.  
  _AC:_ 5 goldens pass locally & in CI; failure surfaces diff of inputs/transforms/versions.
- **A3. Repro Tolerance Windows**  
  _Stories:_ define tolerances for centrality, K‚Äëshortest paths, community metrics.  
  _AC:_ doc table published; CI uses same thresholds.

### Epic B ‚Äî License/Authority Compiler (LAC)

- **B1. Planner Hook‚Äëin**  
  _Stories:_ parse policies ‚Üí compile ‚Üí inject into query planner; unsafe ops un‚Äëexecutable.  
  _AC:_ blocked queries show actionable reason; audit writes policy/authority ID.
- **B2. Policy Diff Simulator**  
  _Stories:_ dry‚Äërun a policy change vs. historical queries; produce dashboard & CSV export.  
  _AC:_ 50‚Äëcase corpus simulated under 3 policy variants < 5s each.
- **B3. Reason‚Äëfor‚ÄëAccess Prompting**  
  _Stories:_ UX modal + API; reason captured, signed, and bound to audit record.  
  _AC:_ 100% coverage on sensitive views; audit search by reason substring works.

### Epic C ‚Äî Zero‚ÄëKnowledge Trust Exchange (ZK‚ÄëTX) MVP

- **C1. Pepper & Salt Protocols**  
  _Stories:_ per‚Äëtenant salts; rotating pepper; envelope format; key rotation doc.  
  _AC:_ cryptographic review checklist passes; rotation demoed.
- **C2. Set/Range Proof Service**  
  _Stories:_ build service for overlap/no‚Äëoverlap proofs; REST + gRPC; rate‚Äëlimit & audit.  
  _AC:_ two‚Äëtenant demo passes with real proofs; logs contain no raw selectors.
- **C3. Partner Handshake & Appeals**  
  _Stories:_ write runbook: onboarding, FP insurance pool, appeal workflow.  
  _AC:_ tabletop exercise performed; artifacts published.

---

## 9) Acceptance Packs

- **PCQ Golden Fixtures:** 5 labeled cases covering link/path/community metrics with expected manifests.
- **LAC Corpus:** 50 historical queries with mixed policy outcomes; expected block/allow & reason strings.
- **ZK‚ÄëTX Demo:** Two tenants, 1 overlap, 1 no‚Äëoverlap scenario; audit log review checklist.

---

## 10) Test Strategy

- **Unit/Contract:** manifest validation, compiler bytecode, proof APIs.
- **E2E:** ingest ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí PCQ verify ‚Üí policy block/allow ‚Üí ZK‚ÄëTX outcome.
- **Load:** verifier on 10 parallel cases; proof service QPS spikes.
- **Security:** secret hygiene, pepper rotation, authz on proof endpoints.
- **Chaos:** intentional proof‚Äëservice outage; verify graceful degradation and alerting.

## 11) Architecture (ASCII Sketch)

```
[Client/Copilot]
    |  (queries with policy context)
[Query Planner] --(policy bytecode)--> [LAC Gate]
    | allowed plans
[Analytics Engine] --(manifests)--> [Provenance Ledger]
    | results + manifests
[Verifier CLI/CI] <----- fixtures -----> [Replay DAG]

[Tenants A,B] --(salted selectors)--> [ZK‚ÄëTX Service] --(proofs)--> [Audit Sink]
```

---

## 12) Risks & Mitigations

- **R1: Determinism drift across platforms.**  
  _Mitigation:_ tolerance windows, seed control, pinned libs; doc exact deltas.
- **R2: Policy false positives blocking valid work.**  
  _Mitigation:_ diff simulator + appeal path; staged ‚Äòmonitor‚Äô mode before ‚Äòenforce‚Äô.
- **R3: ZK‚ÄëTX crypto misconfig.**  
  _Mitigation:_ checklist, key ceremonies, rotation demo; external review.
- **R4: Demo fragility.**  
  _Mitigation:_ ephemeral env script, seeded data, smoke tests on deploy.

---

## 13) Metrics & Dashboards

- **PCQ:** % artifacts with manifests; verifier pass rate; avg replay time.
- **LAC:** policy blocks vs. allows; false positive rate; simulator latency.
- **ZK‚ÄëTX:** proofs generated/day; FP appeals; time‚Äëto‚Äëresolution.
- **Ops:** SLOs (p95 latency), error budgets, cost per insight.

---

## 14) Release Notes (Planned v0.1)

- PCQ manifests v1.1 + external verifier CLI.
- LAC planner enforcement + diff simulator + reason‚Äëfor‚Äëaccess UX.
- ZK‚ÄëTX MVP (set/range proofs) + partner runbook.
