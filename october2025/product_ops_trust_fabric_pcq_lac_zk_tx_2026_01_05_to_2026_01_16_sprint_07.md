# 🚀 Workstream Packet — Product Ops • Trust Fabric (PCQ • LAC • ZK‑TX)

**Cadence:** 2‑week sprint (Jan 5–Jan 16, 2026)
**Ordinal:** Sprint 07 (v1.1 release)
**Role:** Product Operations / Program & Scrum Mastery (Elara Voss)
**Aligned Streams:** Graph Core, Copilot/XAI, Security & Governance, DevEx/Tooling, Infra/SRE, Partner Success, Compliance

---

## 0) TL;DR

Turn the v1.1 seed into a **polished release** focused on reliability, author velocity, and partner scale:

1. **PCQ v1.7**: cross‑runtime reproducibility checks, **anomaly triage automation**, and **timeline diffs** across releases.
2. **LAC v1.1**: author analytics, **policy bundles** (reusable presets), and **blast‑radius previews** for risky promotions.
3. **ZK‑TX v1.2**: multi‑proof batching plans, **PSI‑style join variant** (design), and **SDK parity** (Python/TS/Go).

Ops: green SLOs at higher load, incident postmortems templated, **enterprise enablement kit** for field teams.

---

## 1) Inputs & Carry‑Ins

- Sprint 06 closed: adaptive sampling 10–12%, delta workbench, backfill (≥85%), LAC analytics + risk v2, self‑serve onboarding, fairness monitors, SDK quickstarts.
- Carry‑ins: backfill tail (remaining ≤15%), polish workbench clustering, expand red‑team corpus to 450.

## 2) Sprint Goal

> “Release **v1.1** with tighter reproducibility, safer/faster policy authoring, and partner‑scale proof flows—**no‑surprises** upgrade from GA.”

**Definition of Done (Sprint 07 / v1.1):**

- PCQ: cross‑runtime checks active in CI; **auto‑triage** tags 90% of anomaly classes; release timeline diffs published.
- LAC: policy bundles live; author analytics & adoption reports; blast‑radius preview in Studio; risk v2 tuned.
- ZK‑TX: batch planner improves throughput ≥15% at equal SLO; PSI‑variant ADR approved; SDKs aligned.
- Ops/Enablement: v1.1 notes, upgrade guide, field kit, and updated runbooks shipped; dashboards show SLOs green under step‑load.

- **Ops:** upgrade guide PDF; field kit; drill artifacts.

---

## 10) Test Strategy

- **Unit/Contract:** cross‑runtime tolerance calc; triage classifier; bundle resolution; batch planner scheduling.
- **E2E:** plan→policy preview→enforce; replay→triage→timeline publish; batch proofs under quotas.
- **Perf:** step‑load 300→360 RPS; Studio latency with preview; CI matrix duration budget.
- **Security:** policy bypass, SDK input validation, ADR privacy constraints.

---

## 11) Risks & Mitigations

- **R7.1: Matrix CI timeouts.** → Parallelize fixtures, shard; skip large cases off‑PR.
- **R7.2: Auto‑triage mislabels.** → Human override + feedback; confidence thresholds.
- **R7.3: Batch planner starvation.** → Fairness constraints; per‑tenant tokens; watchdog.

---

## 12) Release Notes (Planned v1.1)

- Reproducibility across runtimes with automated anomaly triage.
- Faster, safer policy authoring via bundles + blast‑radius previews.
- Higher partner throughput with batch planning; SDKs in Python/TS/Go.
- Upgrade guide + field enablement; on‑call templates.
