[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Jan 6 – Jan 17, 2026 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Stability Classification + Trace Correlation — quantify drift, bind trust, unify alerts by causal path.
- **Workstream Theme:** Predict, Bind, Correlate — from observed variance to enforceable integrity.
- **Target Output:** Stability classifier pipeline, tracepath hash anchors, correlation dashboard.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE
- RT capture + red team output must now feed **automated stability decisions**.
- Hash-anchored causal chains are needed to unify disparate alerts by semantic path.
- Analysts benefit from **pre-flagged unstable joins**, not just passive traces.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Jan 6–17)
1. **Stability Classifier Pipeline**
   - Train on prior prompt pairs, join hops, and alert tags.  
   - Output: stable, volatile, unstable (tri-label) classification.
2. **Hash-Locked Trace Paths**
   - Derive canonical path hash for each RAG chain.  
   - Attach to audit log, export, and alert artifact.
3. **Alert Correlation Engine**
   - Unify incidents with shared path hash, claim set, or model delta.  
   - Group by probable root cause → summarize impact.
4. **Analyst Correlation Dashboard**
   - Visual overlay of trace hash clusters.  
   - Manual override + tagging of root cause + surface volatility.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)
- Predictive prompt sanitizer
- Causal chain replay with rollback snapshot

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE
- **Sources:** Red team logs, RTQC path diffs, audit drift index.
- **Assumptions:** Each query path has deterministic trace logic.
- **Uncertainty:** Classifier false-positive rate needs tuning.
- **Verification:**
  - Classifier validation against known drift cases
  - Hash collision check
  - Alert-group accuracy sampling

| Layer         | Cadence          | Responsible Artifact                            |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Daily         | Stability Feed   | Classifier Output + Drift Tags                  |
| Weekly        | Correlation Sync | Path Hash Groups, Delta Heatmaps               |
| Biweekly (83M)| Model Audit Trail| Model Switch Deltas, Classifier Accuracy Logs   |
| Monthly       | Integrity Digest | Stability Maps, Unified Alert Graphs           |
