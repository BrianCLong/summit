[Name], pilot shows [X%] cycle‑time ↓ / [Y] risks mitigated. Runbook + rollback attached. Can we route the order form this week?

**Email – Gov Capture**  
_Subject:_ Path‑to‑yes: [VEHICLE] + 30‑60‑90  
Based on [mission need], propose [OTA/CSO/IDIQ] with a 30‑60‑90 plan. Open to a 25‑min capture sync?

## 6) Risks & Mitigations

- **Security review stalls** → CFK gate; office hours; pre‑answered FAQ; audit‑log exemplars.
