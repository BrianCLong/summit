# Where is it vis mvp-2 or GA

As of the latest public release labeled "v2025.09.30-golden," the IntelGraph platform is solidly in its MVP-1 phase, which is marked as complete. MVP-1 includes the core platform plus advanced AI/ML extraction engines, enhanced AI-powered analytics, and expanded security and observability capabilities.

### Current Stage:

- **MVP-0:** Core platform foundation (completed)
- **MVP-1:** Advanced AI/ML extraction, multimodal analytics, strong security (completed)
- **MVP-2:** Not yet released or publicly detailed in the current repository or documentation

### Status of MVP-2 or General Availability (GA)

- MVP-2 and GA stages are not explicitly published or tagged in the repository as of September 30, 2025.
- No release notes, changelogs, or roadmap information available in the repo or public channels reference MVP-2 features or GA readiness.
- Presumably, MVP-2 will focus on feature finalization, scale/performance optimization, possibly enterprise integrations, and formal GA validation and compliance, but these details are not yet in the public domain.

### Summary

IntelGraph is production-ready at MVP-1 with a strong foundation and complete AI-augmented investigation tooling, but MVP-2 or GA releases remain forthcoming and unpublished as of now.

If updated roadmaps or feature lists for MVP-2 or GA status become available, those can be reviewed and summarized on request.As of the latest public release "v2025.09.30-golden," IntelGraph is fully complete through MVP-1, which includes the core platform plus advanced AI/ML extraction and enterprise security features. MVP-2 and General Availability (GA) stages are not yet publicly released, detailed, or tagged in the repository or documents. Thus, the platform is production-ready at MVP-1 but has not formally reached MVP-2 or GA. Further details on MVP-2 or GA timelines and features are not currently available.
