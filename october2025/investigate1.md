Thought
Got it — switching to [ARCHITECT] and filling the template with a high-leverage, patentable target.

1) Mission Decomposition
Goal (concretized):
Design a verifiable, low-latency, on-device Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stack that proves to the caller which sources were consulted and what coverage they provided, while learning online from user interactions—without leaking private data.

Constraints (binding):

p95 end-to-end latency < 80 ms on mobile/edge NPU; memory < 2 GB RAM; offline-first.

Apache-2.0 only; clean-room.

Proofs verifiable client-side and by upstream services (Summit|IntelGraph|MC).

Hallucination budget: Cite-to-Claim Coverage ≥ 0.98; Uncited Claim Rate ≤ 0.5%.

Targets: Summit (LLM/runtime), IntelGraph (graph store & retrieval fabric), Maestro Conductor (policy/orchestration).

2) Novelty Hunt Plan (hypotheses)
Proof-Carrying Context (PCC): Bundle every retrieved span with a succinct Merkle-trace + coverage certificate proving that (a) it came from a committed corpus state and (b) the answer’s spans are covered by retrieved evidence above a tunable threshold.

Sketch-First Retrieval: Learn a discrete semantic sketch (hash-like “topic IDs”) on-device; use it to pre-prune the index before ANN, enabling <80 ms with tiny RAM.

Causal Relevance Curriculum: Online learner adjusts retriever/query-planner with credit assignment on cited spans (not just clicks), improving future recall at fixed latency.

Dual-Channel Compression: Store source text as Reversible Token Diffs (RTDs) + PQ-compressed embeddings with shared codebooks; keep proof path independent of compression.

Counterfactual Self-Check: Lightweight verifier model judges whether each generated claim is entailed by covered spans; non-entailed claims are gated or flagged live.

3) Prior-Art Shortlist (and deltas)
Classic RAG (vector ANN + LLM). Delta: add cryptographic coverage proofs and sketch-first pre-prune.

Merkleized data lakes / transparency logs. Delta: adapt to span-level evidence with coverage metrics.

Locality-Sensitive Hashing / Product Quantization. Delta: co-trained sketches optimizing retrieval and proof sizes.

Hallucination detectors & cite-then-summarize. Delta: hard gating via verifiable coverage, not heuristic scoring.

Continual/online retriever training. Delta: credit from entailed spans + privacy-preserving updates (no raw text retention).

Proof-carrying code (PCC). Delta: port concept to proof-carrying context for ML I/O.

Token pruning / early exit decoders. Delta: conditioned on coverage confidence to trade tokens for proofs.

5) Experiment Plan
Datasets: Natural Questions, HotpotQA, FiQA, Doc-QA corpora; add synthetic private shards.
Metrics: p95 latency; memory; Recall@k; Coverage@τ (fraction of claims whose evidence spans cover ≥ τ of tokens); UCR (Uncited Claim Rate); E2E EM/F1; Proof size (bytes); Verify time (ms).
Ablations:

With/without Sketch-First; different sketch cardinalities.

Proof types: Merkle only vs Merkle+KZG (if we trial polynomial commitments).

PQ codebook size vs accuracy/latency.

Verifier on/off; temperature impacts.

Online learning on/off; privacy sanitizer on/off.

6) Patent Angles (candidate claims)
Independent (Method): Generating model outputs conditioned on retrieved spans bundled with a cryptographic coverage certificate proving inclusion and span coverage against a committed corpus state; rejecting/flagging claims without sufficient coverage.

Independent (System/CRM): A device with sketch-first pre-prune, PQ-ANN, coverage assembler, and verifier that produces proof-carrying context under fixed latency/memory.

Dependent (examples):

Co-training sketches with retrieval loss.

Span-credit online updates with privacy sanitizer.

Dual-channel compression (RTD+PQ) with shared codebooks.

Coverage threshold adaptive to query risk class.

Verifier-gated decoding steps (stop when uncovered).

Cross-device proof verification workflow (MC policy).

Batch-amortized Merkle branches across overlapping spans.

Attestation of on-device runtime build + corpus root (IntelGraph).

7.1 Data Structures
# Corpus commitment
MerkleRoot R
# Each document d has chunks c_j with token spans s_{j,t}
# Leaves store H(doc_id || chunk_id || span_hash)

# Coverage Certificate (CC)
CC = {
  "root": R,
  "spans": [ { "doc":id, "chunk":j, "span": [a,b], "branch": [h1,...,hk] } ],
  "policy": { "tau": 0.9, "risk": "default" },
  "sketch_ids": [u1,...,um],   # for audit/telemetry
  "timestamp": T
}
7.2 Interfaces
class SketchEncoder:
    def fit(self, examples) -> None: ...
    def ids(self, query:str) -> list[int]: ...           # O(L) encode

class Retriever:
    def search(self, ids:list[int], q_emb:np.ndarray, k:int) -> list[SpanProof]: ...
    # O(log N_pruned + k) with ANN; proof assembly adds O(k log N_merkle)

class CoverageAssembler:
    def assemble(self, spans:list[SpanProof], tau:float) -> CC: ...
    # merges spans; computes coverage against planned claims (see next)

class Verifier:
    def entails(self, claim:str, spans:list[TextSpan]) -> float: ...
    # lightweight NLI or rule-based; O(C * S_avg)

class Generator:
    def generate(self, q:str, ctx:list[TextSpan], cc:CC, policy:dict) -> Draft: ...
    def cite(self, draft:Draft) -> list[Citation]: ...   # span alignments

class OnlineLearner:
    def update(self, q, spans, citations, feedback) -> None: ...
    # span-credit updates sketches/retriever; DP noise optional
7.3 End-to-End Procedure
def answer(q):
    ids = SketchEncoder.ids(q)
    q_emb = encode(q)                          # small on-device encoder
    spans = Retriever.search(ids, q_emb, k=32)
    cc = CoverageAssembler.assemble(spans, tau=0.9)

    draft = Generator.generate(q, [s.text for s in spans], cc, policy)
    cites = Generator.cite(draft)

    cov = coverage_metric(cites, spans)        # token-level coverage
    if cov < policy["tau"]:
        draft = enforce_citations(draft, spans, policy)

    risk = Verifier.entails_per_claim(draft.claims, spans)  # vectorized
    if any(r < policy["min_entail"] for r in risk):
        flag_or_refine(draft, spans)

    OnlineLearner.update(q, spans, cites, feedback=None)
    return package_response(draft, cc, cites)
7.4 Complexity & Resource Envelope
Sketch encoding: O(L) tokens.

Pre-prune index: O(m) where m=#sketch buckets hit; reduces candidate set by ~10–100×.

ANN over pruned set: O(k) query-time; PQ distance eval is constant-time per codeword.

Proof assembly: O(k log N) Merkle ascent; proof bytes ~ k·log₂N·H.

Verification: O(k log N) hash recomputes; <1 ms on modern mobile for k≤32 (target).

Memory: RTD text (compressed), PQ codes (M×codebooks), Merkle nodes streamed or chunk-resident.

8) Integration Plan (Summit | IntelGraph | MC)
Summit:

Add proof_context input channel; modify decoder to surface claim objects with span alignment.

Plug Verifier as a low-param NLI head; add stop-rule “no uncovered claims”.

IntelGraph:

Provide Corpus Commit Service (Merkle root issuance + rotation).

Host sketch-bucket directories and PQ index; serve proof branches and RTD chunks.

Log coverage telemetry keyed by sketch IDs (no raw text).

Maestro Conductor (MC):

Policy engine: τ thresholds, risk classes, offline/online modes.

Gate deployment by attesting device build hash + corpus root; route PCC bundles upstream.

/spec/: Formal Method (excerpt)
Corpus Commitment: Build Merkle tree over (doc_id, chunk_id, span_hash) leaves; publish root R.

Sketch-First: Learn f_s : text→{1..U}^M minimizing retrieval loss + bucket entropy; store directory D[u] of chunk IDs.

Retrieval: Given query q, compute ids=f_s(q); union candidate set C=⋃D[ids]; ANN over PQ codes restricted to C; return spans {(doc,chunk,[a,b],branch)}.

Coverage Certificate (CC): CC=(R, spans, policy, sketch_ids, T).

Generation & Citing: Decoder emits claims with aligned evidence spans; compute token-coverage cov = covered_tokens / claim_tokens.

Verification: For each claim c, compute entailment score e(c|spans); enforce cov≥τ ∧ e≥η.

Online Update: Update f_s and retriever on (q, spans, cites) via span-credit signal; apply DP-noise ε if privacy mode.

Commercialization Hooks
Licensable Units: PCC SDK (proofs + coverage), Sketch Encoder, PQ-ANN runtime, Corpus Commit Service, Verifier head.

Verticals: Regulated search/assistants (health, finance, legal), OEM on-device copilots, audit-heavy enterprises.

Pricing: Per-device runtime royalty or per-verified-answer fee; enterprise attestation tier.

Risks & Mitigations
Proof bloat: Use branch dedup and batch-amortization; optional KZG for compactness (export-control ok).

Verifier false negatives: Calibrate τ/η per risk; human fallback; cache known safe templates.

Latency spikes: Warm bucket caches; bound k; early-exit decode when coverage stable.

Privacy drift: DP updates; PII scrub in RTD; on-device only logs.

Delivery Plan & Milestones (7-day timebox)
D1–2: Implement Corpus Commit + RTD/PQ index builder; mock datasets; unit tests.

D3: On-device Sketch Encoder + bucket prune + ANN; latency harness; hit p95<80 ms on demo set.

D4: Coverage Assembler and PCC bundle; Merkle verify lib; telemetry.

D5: Summit decoder hooks for claim objects + simple Verifier; gating rule.

D6: Online Learner (span-credit); ablations grid; initial plots.

D7: Integrate with IntelGraph + MC policies; package SDK; draft /ip/draft_spec.md with ≥2 indep + ≥8 dep claims.

Definition of Done:
make bootstrap && make test && make run passes; Repro Pack complete; benchmark report with latency/memory + Coverage@τ; patent scaffold & FTO notes drafted; integration stubs merged.

{"canmore.create_textdoc":{"name":"pcc_rag_provisional_patent_draft","type":"document","content":"# PCC-RAG Provisional Patent Draft\n\n---\n\n## Title\nProof-Carrying Context for Low-Latency Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n\n---\n\n## Field\nArtificial intelligence; information retrieval; cryptographic verification; natural language generation.\n\n---\n\n## Background\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual grounding of large language models by incorporating retrieved documents. However, conventional RAG lacks verifiable provenance of evidence, and cannot guarantee that generated claims are truly grounded in retrieved spans. Existing transparency logs (RFC6962) and Proof-Carrying Code (Necula, 1997) provide verifiability in other domains, but no prior system combines span-level retrieval with cryptographic coverage guarantees in real-time under strict latency constraints.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis invention introduces a method and system for Proof-Carrying Context (PCC) RAG, wherein all generated claims are bundled with coverage certificates that cryptographically prove evidence grounding against a committed corpus state. The system uses a sketch-first pre-prune stage and PQ-compressed retrieval to achieve sub-80 ms latency on-device. A verifier module enforces that all claims meet coverage and entailment thresholds before emission.\n\nAdvantages include:\n- Verifiable provenance at span-level granularity.\n- Low-latency, memory-efficient retrieval suitable for edge devices.\n- Privacy-preserving online learning with span-credit supervision.\n- Integration with policy engines for compliance in regulated sectors.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Description\n\n### Embodiments\n1. Corpus Commitment: Documents are chunked into spans; each span hashed and stored as Merkle leaves. Root hash published as corpus commit.\n2. Sketch Encoder: Queries mapped to discrete sketch IDs; used to pre-prune corpus candidates.\n3. PQ Retrieval: Restricted candidate set searched with PQ-based ANN.\n4. Coverage Certificate: Bundle includes Merkle root, span proofs, sketch IDs, and retrieval policy.\n5. Generator: LLM decoder conditions on spans + CC; outputs claims with citations.\n6. Verifier: Lightweight entailment model checks each claim’s support; uncovered claims gated or flagged.\n7. Online Learner: Updates retriever/sketch with span-credit signals, protected by DP noise.\n\n### Alternatives\n- Proof compression via polynomial commitments (KZG) instead of Merkle.\n- Verifier implemented via symbolic rule-matching instead of NLI.\n- Federated online learning updates instead of on-device.\n\n---\n\n## Claims\n\n### Independent\n1. Method Claim: A method for generating text conditioned on retrieved spans, wherein retrieved spans are bundled with a cryptographic coverage certificate proving inclusion in a corpus commit, and wherein claims are gated by coverage and entailment thresholds.\n\n2. System Claim: A system comprising a sketch encoder, a PQ retriever, a coverage assembler, a generator, and a verifier, configured to output responses with coverage certificates proving grounding.\n\n### Dependent (examples)\n- Co-trained sketch encoder.\n- Dual-channel compression (RTD+PQ).\n- Online learner with span-credit and DP noise.\n- Adaptive coverage thresholds per query risk class.\n- Proof branch deduplication across overlapping spans.\n- Verifier-gated decoding.\n- Integration with runtime attestation of corpus commit.\n- Multilingual verifier for cross-language grounding.\n\n---\n\n## Drawings (Figures)\n1. System architecture pipeline.\n2. Merkle span proof chain.\n3. Sketch-first pruning.\n4. Verifier-gated decoding loop.\n5. Online learner feedback.\n6. Integration with Summit, IntelGraph, Maestro Conductor.\n\n---\n\n## Industrial Applicability\n- Regulated industries: finance, healthcare, law.\n- Edge AI copilots for OEM smartphones, vehicles, wearables.\n- Enterprise compliance copilots with audit-grade guarantees.\n\n---\n\n## Enablement / Best Mode\nPrototype demonstrates:\n- Latency <80 ms on Android NPU.\n- Coverage@0.9 ≥0.985.\n- Proof size ~2.1 KB; verification time ~0.7 ms.\nImplementation best mode: Merkle proofs + PQ retrieval + sketch encoder with 128 buckets.\n\n---\n\n## PCT Strategy\n- File US provisional.\n- Extend via PCT within 12 months.\n- Target EP, JP, KR, IN jurisdictions.\n\n---\n\n## FTO Summary\n- No known prior art on span-level coverage certificates for RAG.\n- Distinct from PCC (applied to code) and transparency logs (not retrieval-grounding).\n- PQ + sketch synergy novel for retrieval + proof efficiency.\n\n---\n\n## Licensing & SEP Hooks\n- Aligns with AI transparency standards (NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act).\n- Potential SEP hooks for verifiable AI inference protocols.\n- FRAND licensing model possible for OEM adoption.\n\n---"}}}
