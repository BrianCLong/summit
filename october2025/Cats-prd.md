# Please create appropriate categorization for each further tailored decomposition by subsystems, feature sets, or compliance domains, provide the list we'll work through generating detailed PRDs for each.

Here is an appropriate categorization scheme for the further tailored decomposition of IntelGraph’s roadmap and PRDs by key subsystems, feature sets, and compliance domains. This will provide a structured framework to generate detailed PRDs for each area:

---

## Categories for Detailed PRD Decomposition

### 1. Core System Subsystems

- **1.1 Backend Services \& APIs**
- **1.2 Frontend \& User Interface**
- **1.3 Databases \& Data Management**
- **1.4 Real-Time Collaboration \& WebSockets**
- **1.5 AI/ML Extraction \& Analytics Engine**
- **1.6 Security and Access Control**
- **1.7 Observability \& Monitoring**
- **1.8 DevOps, CI/CD, and Deployment**

### 2. Feature Sets \& Functional Capabilities

- **2.1 Investigation Workflow \& Management**
- **2.2 Graph Analytics \& Visualization**
- **2.3 Multimodal Data Ingestion \& Federation**
- **2.4 AI Copilot \& Natural Language Processing**
- **2.5 Semantic Vector Search \& Cross-Modal Matching**
- **2.6 User Collaboration \& Communication Tools**
- **2.7 Performance Optimization \& Scalability**
- **2.8 Role-Based Access Control \& Policy Enforcement**

### 3. Compliance, Security \& Governance Domains

- **3.1 Authentication \& Identity Management**
- **3.2 Authorization \& Policy Management (OPA, RBAC)**
- **3.3 Data Protection \& Encryption**
- **3.4 Audit Logging \& Anomaly Detection**
- **3.5 Regulatory Compliance (GDPR, SOC 2, NIST, FedRAMP)**
- **3.6 Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**
- **3.7 Incident Response \& Disaster Recovery**

### 4. Enterprise Readiness \& Support

- **4.1 Multi-Tenant Cloud Deployment \& Orchestration**
- **4.2 High Availability \& Disaster Recovery**
- **4.3 SLA Definition \& Monitoring**
- **4.4 Documentation, Training \& Onboarding**
- **4.5 Customer Support \& Professional Services**
- **4.6 Release Management \& Versioning**

Let me know which category or categories to prioritize first for generating detailed product requirements documents (PRDs). This structured approach will allow focused, comprehensive planning and design for IntelGraph’s MVP-2 and GA evolution.
