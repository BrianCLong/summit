# MC Sprint — Q2’26 / Sprint 34 (2026‑04‑13 → 2026‑04‑24)
**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2026-04-13-sprint34-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q2’26 “Scale & Pilotization” (wave 2)

---
## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star
**Scale Decisions → Open Gates (Safely).** If staged metrics hold, open **Federated Search (FS)** to **open GA** with tenant‑level switches and fallbacks; complete **Predictive** rollout (or finish remediation and re‑review); expand **Marketplace Discovery (MP‑D)** pilot with partner SLAs and evidence packets; keep **XAI‑2** coverage & SLOs stable; enforce **Metering** accuracy for month‑end; and streamline **Onboarding Factory v2** throughput.

**Sprint Goal:** FS open GA readiness with flip‑per‑tenant controls; Predictive at target rollout depth or remediation completion; MP‑D pilot to 8–10 vetted sources; XAI‑2 SLOs stable; metering exports pristine; +1 tenant live via packs.

**Success KPIs:**
- SLO: **0** Sev‑1; burn alarms **< 15m**; p95 (4‑hop/100k) **≤ 0.85s**  
- FS open GA: **tenant‑switchable**, e2e p95 **≤ 1.25s** across GA tenants, complaint rate **< 1.2%**, ≥ **+5%** ctr@5 vs baseline  
- Predictive rollout (if go): **coverage ≥ 70%** of GA tenants; audits **≥ 99%**; zero rollbacks *(or remediation closed with re‑review date)*  
- MP‑D pilot: **8–10** sources live, each with DPIA/license packets and signed request‑to‑connect trails  
- XAI‑2: export coverage **≥ 98%**; counterfactual hints **≥ 90%**; failure bucket **< 1%**  
- Metering: variance **≤ 0.3%**; exports delivered for **100%** tenants on schedule  
- Onboarding: **+1** tenant live; zero policy blocks at go‑live

---
## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals
### In‑Scope
- **FS open GA enablement:** tenant flip controls, guardrails, quality dashboards, stitched provenance proof bundles, single‑index fallback.
- **Predictive rollout/remediation:** quotas, abuse rules, on‑call playbooks, model card 1.4 client‑visible, rollback rehearsals **or** remediation closeout.
- **MP‑D pilot growth:** partner SLAs, DPIA/license packets, allow‑list & audit packets.
- **XAI‑2 ops:** exporter reliability, coverage SLOs, a11y copy, opt‑out accounting, caveat banners.
- **Metering month‑end:** rotation rehearsal, drift alarms, finance dashboards, invoice previews.
- **Onboarding factory v2:** self‑serve packs, policy sim, evidence bundles, appeal tokens.
- **Ops hygiene:** warmers v3 tuning, noisy‑alert pruning, access review exports.

### Non‑Goals
- MP‑D transactions/billing (still discovery).  
- FS per‑tenant UX personalization beyond GA flip and metrics.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **FS GA flip regressions** → staged flips; strict alarms; fallback; rollback scripts.  
- **Predictive misuse** → quotas; sandbox; rollback drills; exemplar guidance.  
- **MP‑D license/SLA drift** → registry checksums; SLA template; ombuds packet.  
- **XAI exporter failures** → retries; failure buckets; SLO alarms.  
- **Metering drift** → rotation rehearsal; alarms; Finance co‑review.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- FS p95 & ctr@5, complaint rate; predictive audits (≥99%); MP‑D pilot activity; XAI coverage/failure SLOs; onboarding throughput; metering variance (≤0.3%); burn alarms (<15m).  
- Weekly: burndown, scope ledger, blocker aging.

---
## 11) Demo Script (10–12 min)
1. FS open‑GA flip (tenant switch) → blended search; partials labeled; stitched export & license clauses.  
2. Predictive rollout status (or remediation closure) + audit sampling dashboard.  
3. MP‑D pilot: partner source cards; request‑to‑connect packet verify.  
4. XAI‑2 SLO dashboards; failure bucket tour; copy/caveats.  
5. Metering: rotation rehearsal & drift report; invoice preview batch.  
6. Onboarding: policy‑sim → go‑live; evidence bundle.  
7. SLO burn chart; warmers v3 impact.
