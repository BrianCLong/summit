[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Nov 3 – Nov 14, 2025 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Operationalize the integrity loop — deploy RAG harness, visualize drift, enforce constraints.
- **Workstream Theme:** Visibility, Variance, Verification — ensure LLM output integrity + claim consistency.
- **Target Output:** Visualized replay of attack simulations, LLM drift maps, ABAC guard UI and deployment.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE

- RAG drift and red team replay tools were completed (Oct 31), revealing output inconsistencies under prompt mutation and graph fuzzing.
- The audit log showed variance in lineage assertion under malformed evidence injection.
- Claim regression and hallucinated joins occurred on 4.2% of tests in Drift Harness v1.

This sprint focuses on **operationalizing the outputs**: building a visual front-end for trace/debug, deploying constraint policies, and synthesizing a known-drift dataset for ongoing regression tracking.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Nov 3–14)

1. **Drift Harness v1.1**
   - Integrate structured output comparison (hash tree + semantic diff).
   - Tag scenarios by failure mode and surface cause.
2. **Red Team Replay Visuals**
   - Launch replay dashboard (query graph, resolver path, expected vs actual).
   - Map replay sets to documented exploit classes.
3. **OPA Constraint Builder UI**
   - Build schema-bound visual editor for graph constraints.
   - Export to Rego policy bundle with unit test scaffold.
4. **Drift Dataset Synthesis**
   - Construct canonical test graph with known edge-cases.
   - Embed in CI pipeline for regression detection.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)

- Full graph explainability interface
- Model fingerprinting & prompt normalization

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE

- **Sources:** LLM Drift Harness logs, red team test packs, provenance export diffs.
- **Assumptions:** CI environment supports lineage trace replays.
- **Uncertainty:** Replay fidelity for multi-hop joins requires further tracing.
- **Verification:**
  - Runbook-driven replay audit
  - CI-based drift detection on known cases
