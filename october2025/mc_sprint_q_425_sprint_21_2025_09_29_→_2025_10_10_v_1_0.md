# MC Sprint — Q4’25 / Sprint 21 (2025‑09‑29 → 2025‑10‑10)

**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2025-09-29-sprint21-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q4’25 “Foundations GA”

---

## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star

Hardening the **Core GA** path while bringing **Provenance Ledger (beta)** and **Predictive Threat Suite (alpha)** over the line, with visible **SLO dashboards**, **cost guards**, and an **offline expedition kit v1**. Ten priority connectors ready with manifests and tests. Ethics, provenance, and compartmentation remain first‑class.

**Sprint Goal (single‑sentence):** Ship a demonstrable, governed IntelGraph slice that ingests → resolves → analyzes → cites → exports with verifiable provenance, measurable SLOs, and a minimal offline kit, all behind clear policy gates.

**Success KPIs this sprint:**

- p95 query latency for 3‑hop/50k neighborhood < **1.5s** (bench)
- Ingest 10k docs E2E < **5m** on sample connectors
- Prov‑Ledger export manifests verify **100%** on provided verifier
- Cost guard blocks ≥ **3** intentionally abusive queries in staging (with human‑readable reasons)
- Offline kit v1: end‑to‑end **hello‑case** runs completely disconnected; produces a synced divergence report on reconnect
- 10 connectors each with manifest, mapping, license/TOS flags, and golden IO tests

---

## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals

### In‑Scope

- Core GA hardening: authZ (ABAC/OPA) paths, tri‑pane UI stability, GraphQL persisted queries & cost limits.
- Provenance & Claim Ledger (service boundary) **M2**: evidence registration, claim graph, export manifest + verifier.
- Predictive Threat Suite **alpha**: timeline stub + counterfactual API behind feature flag, Helm deploy.
- Ops/Observability: OTEL traces, SLO dashboards, burn alerts; **Cost Guard** MVP; chaos drill dry‑run.
- Offline/Edge kit v1: CRDT merges, signed sync logs, “hello‑case” flow.
- Connectors: Top‑10 tranche with mapping wizard, DPIA/PII flags, redaction presets, license registry.

### Non‑Goals (this sprint)

- Graph‑XAI fairness/robustness dashboards (tracked, not shipping).
- Federated multi‑graph search (out of scope).
- Marketplace & partner tiers (tracked epics only).

## 3) Sprint Backlog (Epics → Stories → Acceptance)

### EPIC A — Core GA Hardening

- **A1. GraphQL Persisted Queries & Cost Limits**  
  _Stories:_
  - A1‑S1: Persisted query registry with token buckets per tenant.

  _Acceptance:_ full case replay offline; divergence report generated on reconnect.

### EPIC F — Connectors (Top‑10)

- **F1. Connector Manifests & Mapping Wizard**  
  _Stories:_ schema mapping w/ AI suggestions; PII flags; DPIA checklist; license/TOS enforcement.  
  _Acceptance:_ each connector ships manifest, sample dataset, and golden IO tests; blocked export shows license clause.

### EPIC G — Runbooks & Reporting

- **G1. Narrative/Brief Studio**  
  _Stories:_ CH tables, residual unknowns, dissent annex hooks; one‑click PDF/HTML with redaction.  
  _Acceptance:_ generated brief contains inline citations and confidence bands; redaction map attached.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **Policy drift blocks queries** → dry‑run policy simulator before rollout; emergency bypass with dual‑control.
- **Model misuse/prompt injection** → guardrail prompts quarantined; red‑team tests; appeals path.
- **Data poisoning in feeds** → telemetry sanity gates; quarantine lanes; honeypot tagging.
- **Cost spikes** → budget caps + downshift modes; archived tier hints; autoscaling guardrails.
- **Offline divergence conflicts** → CRDT strategy docs; operator approvals required on merge.

---
## 10) Metrics, Dashboards & Reporting
- **Dashboards:** latency heatmaps, ingestion throughput, ER quality, contradiction density, cost explorer.
- **North‑Star:** time‑to‑first‑insight; hypothesis accuracy; false‑positive reduction; disclosure cycle time; SLO adherence; unit cost per case.
- **Weekly roll‑ups:** burndown, scope change ledger, blocked/ageing items.

---
## 11) Demo Script (10–12 min)
1. Ingest sample dataset via Connector #3 (license flagged) → mapping wizard (PII & DPIA prompts).
2. ER + policy‑aware snapshot‑at‑time; tri‑pane UX walkthrough; “Explain this view.”
3. Hypothesis Workbench generates CH table; narrative brief with inline citations & confidence bands.
4. Prov‑Ledger export → run verifier CLI; show contradiction/reply in disclosure pack.
5. Predictive alpha: timeline forecast + simple counterfactual impact.
6. Ops view: SLO dashboard; trigger a costly query → cost guard response (with hints).
7. Offline kit: run hello‑case offline; reconnect and show divergence report.
