[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Oct 6 – Oct 17, 2025 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Extend the IntelGraph Core via graph+claim reasoning, evidence prioritization, and automated provenance locking.
- **Workstream Theme:** Make trust auditable by design — expand graph capacity, enforce ABAC inline, detect data drift.
- **Target Output:** Deployable, auditable sprint module with rollback, lineage, and SLO verifications.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE

- Existing sprints (Sept 29–Dec) follow a Q4 lockstep with Maestro Conductor (MC), IntelGraph, and Summit CompanyOS.
- Definitions of Ready/Done are robust — DPA/SLSA/SBOM mandatory at release gates.
- Most recent sprint work establishes ingestion → ER → NL → Cypher → export with full provenance.
- However, **evidence confidence scoring**, **claim-linking heuristics**, and **tripwire placement logic** are underdeveloped.

We forecast increased adversarial pressure on provenance manipulation and edge-case abuse. The next step is closing the loop: ingestion context → derived assertions → export lineage — with a continuous attestation and rollback scaffold.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Oct 6–17)

1. **Claim Confidence Layer**
   - Implement confidence scoring on evidence nodes (input type, authority, freshness, contradiction).
   - Bubble-up top-risk derivations in graph path.
2. **Provenance Locking**
   - Hash + sign lineage chain at each processing stage.
   - Validate hash tree before export or summary.
3. **ABAC/OPA Expansion**
   - Move from dry-run to enforce across all resolver and export surfaces.
4. **Tripwire Design Framework**
   - Define decoy claim patterns and expected access rates.
   - Emit alerts on variance, integrate with SLO dashboards.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)

- NL Reasoning Drift Test Harness
- Red Team Emulation of Provenance Bypass Attempts

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE

- **Sources:** `october2025.zip`, `summit-main.zip`; extracted and parsed sprint + cadence plans.
- **Assumptions:** Current sprint window runs Oct 6–Oct 17; deploys build to SLO-audited targets.
- **Uncertainty:** Tripwire success metrics not yet defined.
- **Verification:**
  - Manual: Line-by-line audit of `sprint_2025_09_29_intelgraph_v_0_6.md`
  - Automated: hash chain validation script (recommended in next SOAR)
