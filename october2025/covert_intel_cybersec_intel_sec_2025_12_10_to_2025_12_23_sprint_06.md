# Covert Intelligence & Cybersecurity Workstream — Sprint 06 Plan & Artifacts

**Cadence:** 10–23 Dec 2025  
**Role:** Covert Insights (Intelligence & Cybersecurity)  
**Workstream Slug:** `intel-sec`  
**Ordinal:** Sprint 06  
**Status:** Ready to start 30 Sep 2025  
**Prereqs:** Sprint 01–05 complete (CI security → green; DaC; intel scoring v2; TIP export; admission & provenance prod; runtime detections; EDR/SaaS analytics; deception v2; token binding + attestation; egress enforcement; SPIFFE/Sigstore federation; ATT&CK coverage; purple-team v2; cost/risk KPIs).

---

## 1) Executive Summary

**Objective:** Reach **near-total attested identity coverage**, **automate vendor trust**, **operationalize active deception** on crown jewels, and **industrialize content testing** (detections, playbooks, policies) with golden datasets. Evolve intel scoring toward **online learning with human-in-the-loop triage UI**. Cement **Zero Trust posture** with continuous evidence capture and compliance mapping.

**Key Outcomes (by Day 14):**

- **Attestation coverage ≥90%** of tier-0/1 services; federation with 1 vendor/partner domain; cert/key rotation SLOs enforced.
- **Vendor verification & egress**: automated vendor domain proofs (TXT/DNS/CSP) and self-service exception requests with TTL & reviewer workflow.
- **Deception v3** on high-value DBs and admin planes (canary rows, function/webhooks, admin beacons) with IR workflows.
- **Content Testing Platform**: unified harness for rules/playbooks/policies with golden datasets, mutation tests, and release gates.
- **Intel scoring v3 (online)** with reviewer UI and feedback loop; drift guardrails.
- **Zero Trust Evidence Pack**: machine-readable posture report mapped to NIST/ISO/SOC2/PCI sections.

---

## 2) Scope & Alignment

- **Platform/Infra:** finalize federation & mTLS; implement vendor trust proofs; scale egress controller; harden secrets elimination.
- **Data & Analytics:** host golden datasets; model features streaming; dashboards add posture & vendor trust views.
- **Product Teams:** transparent identity/egress; minimal toil via self-service portals and templates.
- **SecOps/Compliance:** approve vendor exceptions; operate deception; review evidence packs.

---

## 3) Deliverables & Definition of Done

### D1: Attested Identity Coverage ≥90% & Vendor Federation

**Deliverables**

- Coverage report per namespace/service; rollout to remaining tier-0/1 services.
- Federation with one **partner/vendor trust domain** (bundle distribution + allowlisted SPIFFE IDs).
- Rotation SLOs (cert TTL ≤ 24h, rotation success rate ≥ 99.5%); alerts & runbooks.

**DoD**

- Coverage ≥90%; cross-domain calls validated; rotations meet SLOs; break-glass tested.

### D2: Automated Vendor Verification & Egress Self-Service

**Deliverables**

- DNS TXT/CSP/.well-known proof verification job to confirm vendor domain ownership and enumerate egress endpoints.
- Self-service portal (static UI + GitOps backend) to request egress exceptions with TTL & approver routing.

**DoD**

- Exceptions require validated proofs; median approval < 24h; 100% exceptions have TTL + audit.

### D3: Deception v3 on Crown Jewels

**Deliverables**

- Canary rows/records in high-value DBs; trigger webhooks on read/write.
- Admin-plane beacons (hidden routes & headers); honey credentials with zero privileges; alert enrichment with session/user context.

**DoD**

- ≥12 deception assets across DB/admin planes; FP ≤ 1/week; MTTA < 10m.

### D4: Content Testing Platform (CTP)

**Deliverables**

- Framework to run **detections/playbooks/policies** against golden datasets & synthetic scenarios in CI.
- Mutation tests (noise injection, field drop, timestamp skew) and **release gates** (coverage %, FP budget).

**DoD**

- All security content PRs run through CTP; release blocked if KPIs fail; baseline suite runs nightly.

### D5: Intel Scoring v3 (Online + Reviewer UI)

**Deliverables**

- Streaming feature updates; online model scoring; reviewer UI to accept/override scores; feedback updates labels.
- Model guardrails (confidence thresholds, abstention, rollback policy) + model card v2.

**DoD**

- Reviewer median decision time < 2m; precision ≥ 0.88; drift within bounds; change audit captured.

### D6: Zero Trust Evidence Pack & Compliance Mapping

**Deliverables**

- Evidence generator producing JSON/YAML bundle with policy states, coverage %, attestation logs, egress exceptions, playbook tests, and access decisions.
- Mapping to NIST 800-207/53, ISO 27001 controls, SOC2 (CC series), PCI DSS relevant items.

**DoD**

- Evidence exported weekly; auditors can trace control→evidence; 100% links valid.
