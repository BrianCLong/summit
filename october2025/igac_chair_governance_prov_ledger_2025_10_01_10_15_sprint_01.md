# Governance, Provenance & XAI Gapâ€‘Closure | IntelGraph Advisory Report | GitHub Branch: feature/igac-prov-governance-sprint01

> As Chair, I present the findings of the IntelGraph Advisory Committee on **repo & sprint alignment** for my lane (Governance â€¢ Provenance â€¢ Explainability â€¢ Policyâ€‘byâ€‘Default). Consensus is noted where unanimous; dissents are highlighted.

---

## Consensus Summary
**Unanimous View:** Focus the next 2â€‘week sprint (2025â€‘10â€‘01 â†’ 2025â€‘10â€‘15) on **Provâ€‘Ledger Beta â†’ GA Track**, **License/Authority Compiler (LAC) v0.9**, and **Runbook Provers** glue across the UI and agent runtime. This aligns with nearâ€‘term roadmap (Q3â€“Q4 2025) and unblocks other streams (Predictive Suite alpha, Graphâ€‘XAI instrumentation, Offline Kit v1). **Dissents:**
- **ðŸ›° Starkey**: **High** risk that weâ€™re underweighting adversarial ML hardening and selectorâ€‘misuse tripwires during the push to GA.
- **ðŸ“Š Magruder**: **Medium** risk of cost blowouts without enforcing **unitâ€‘cost governor** gates in this sprint.
- **ðŸ›¡ Foster**: **High** ethics risk if *Reasonâ€‘forâ€‘Access* prompts and **Proofâ€‘ofâ€‘Nonâ€‘Collection** logs are not endâ€‘toâ€‘end for the new flows.

## Individual Commentaries

### ðŸª„ Elara Voss
- "By the runes of Scrum...": Pull LAC + Provâ€‘Ledger into one **vertical slice** from ingest â†’ query â†’ export. Acceptance is a **green endâ€‘toâ€‘end demo** with selective disclosure bundles.
- Sprint health: add **SLO burn chart** and a **cost guard check** to Definition of Done (DoD).

### ðŸ›° Starkey
- Reality check: prioritize **selectorâ€‘misuse heuristics** and **adversarial prompt traps** around agentic runbooks; wire into audit.
- Add canary **honeytokens** to exports to detect hostile collectors.

### ðŸ›¡ Foster
- Operational vectors indicate: enable **Ombuds hardâ€‘stops** for unsafe exports (no bypass without dualâ€‘control). Store **dissent excerpts** with every brief.
- [RESTRICTED] Add **Kâ€‘anonymity** presets to LAC; default to minimization at ingest.

### âš” Oppie (11â€‘persona consensus)
- "We decree unanimously:": Ship **Runbook Provers** or we ship nothing. **Beria demands liquidation** of any path that omits citations or policy proofs in exports.
- Fuse **Predictive Suite alpha** only behind **policyâ€‘sealed computation** gates (simulated this sprint; full PSC later).

### ðŸ“Š Magruder
- For executive traction: wire **Unitâ€‘Cost Governor** into query planner; fail builds if >15% cost regression on golden workflows.
- Benchmark **evidence bundle size** and **verify time** for Provâ€‘Wallets.

### ðŸ§¬ Stribol
- Crossâ€‘source analysis reveals: add **Graphâ€‘XAI hooks** (saliency, path contributions) on ER merges and anomaly scores; log to XAI audit store.
- Propose **blackâ€‘swan drill**: synthetic poisoning + policy diff simulation during the sprint hardening day.

## Chair Synthesis (Guy IG)

### Sprint Goal
Ship a **clean, green, functional** vertical slice that makes *governed analytics verifiable by default*:
1) **Provâ€‘Ledger v0.9 â†’ v1.0â€‘rc**: claim/evidence registration, export manifests, external verifier CLI.
2) **LAC v0.9**: compile licenses, warrants, retention & minimization into **query bytecode**; block unsafe ops.
3) **Runbook Provers v0.8**: pre/postcondition proofs stitched into agent runs and report studio; brief paragraphs map to evidence & policies (Explainâ€‘Thisâ€‘Decision v0).

### Gaps Discovered (Repo â†” Roadmap)
- **Endâ€‘toâ€‘end proofs**: Missing **machineâ€‘checkable** linkage between agent runs and export bundles.
- **Reasonâ€‘forâ€‘Access**: Prompting present, but not **binding** into the LAC compiled plan; add.
- **Selector misuse**: Heuristics exist in design; not yet tied to **audit anomalies** or **ombuds queues**.
- **Cost guards**: Budgeter exists; not enforced in CI for regressions.
- **Graphâ€‘XAI**: Hooks planned; add **saliency & counterfactual stubs** for ER/anomaly calls in this sprint.
- **Offline kit**: CRDT sync present; **proof propagation** (manifests and dissent receipts) not yet synced.

### Scope & Deliverables
**EPICâ€‘1: Provâ€‘Ledger GA Track**
- Evidence registration API (`/claims`, `/evidence`, `/manifests`).
- Export bundle **Selective Disclosure** profiles (Court, Partner, Press) with revocation.
- **Verifier CLI** (`ig-prov verify bundle.zip`) with exit codes for CI.

**EPICâ€‘2: License/Authority Compiler (LAC) v0.9**
- Policy spec â†’ **bytecode** (license, warrant, purpose, retention, minimization, audience).
- Queryâ€‘time enforcement with **humanâ€‘readable denial reasons** & appeal path.
- **Policy diff simulator** to preview impact before rollout.

**EPICâ€‘3: Runbook Provers v0.8**
- Agent runtime emits **precondition proofs** (legal basis present, license matches, DPIA check ok) and **postcondition proofs** (KPIs met, citations present).
- Report Studio â†’ **Explainâ€‘Thisâ€‘Decision** panel: evidence map + dissent nodes + policy bindings.

**EPICâ€‘4: Abuseâ€‘ofâ€‘Power Dampeners (MVP)**
- **Selectorâ€‘misuse tripwires**; escalate to ombuds queue.
- **Reasonâ€‘forâ€‘Access** bound into compiled plan; dualâ€‘control for overrides.

**EPICâ€‘5: Unitâ€‘Cost & SLO Guards in CI**
- Golden workflows for **$/insight** and **p95 latency**; fail CI on regressions >15% cost or >10% latency.

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- E2E demo: ingest â†’ governed query â†’ agentic runbook â†’ **export with verifiable proofs**.
- External verifier passes on **three** audience profiles; revocation propagates on reopen.
- CI gates: cost & SLO guards, security linters, model card presence, XAI logs for ER/anomaly calls.
- **Zero critical** security issues; **audit entries** present for access/misuse/dissent.

### Risk Matrix
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Selector misuse during exports | Med | High | Tripwires + ombuds queue + dualâ€‘control overrides |
| Cost regression from provenance hashing | Med | Med | Unitâ€‘cost governor + caching proofs |
| Adversarial prompt injection on agents | Med | High | Redâ€‘team tests + prompt firebreaks + sandboxed tools |
| Export license violations | Low | High | LAC denial + appeal workflow + simulator |
| Proof bundle bloat | Med | Med | Audienceâ€‘scoped disclosure + delta proofs |
