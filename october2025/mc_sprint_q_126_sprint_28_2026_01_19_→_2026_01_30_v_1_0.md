# MC Sprint — Q1’26 / Sprint 28 (2026‑01‑19 → 2026‑01‑30)
**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2026-01-19-sprint28-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q1’26 “Federate & Explain” (wave 2)

---
## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star
**From Spikes → Working Alphas.** Promote **Federated Search (FS)** to an internal alpha on 3 sources with guardrails and provenance stitching; advance **Explainability 2.0 (XAI‑2)** to M2 with exportable rationales; ship **Metering 1.0 GA**; expand **Predictive** toward GA‑candidate; and bring **Marketplace Discovery (MP‑D)** to a navigable prototype (no transactions). Keep GA tenants stable and onboard **+1** net‑new tenant via the factory v2.

**Sprint Goal:** Federation + XAI panels working in staging with end‑to‑end provenance exports; Metering 1.0 signed‑off & deployed; one new tenant live via self‑serve packs; SLOs comfortably green.

**Success KPIs:**
- SLO: **0** Sev‑1; burn alarms **< 45m** total; p95 (4‑hop/100k) **≤ 0.95s**  
- Federated Search alpha: blended top‑k across **3 sources**, per‑source latency p95 **≤ 500ms**, end‑to‑end p95 **≤ 1.4s**  
- XAI‑2 M2: per‑edge/node attributions + path rationales exported in **≥90%** of views  
- Metering 1.0: invoice variance **≤ 0.3%** vs shadow; signed exports delivered to **all** GA tenants  
- Onboarding: **+1** new tenant in production via self‑serve packs  
- Predictive: GA‑criteria items **≥60%** complete; audit sampling **≥99%**

---
## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals
### In‑Scope
- **Federated Search (alpha):** adapters (GraphStore, DocIndex, External API), timeouts, partials, license‑aware blending, stitched provenance export, A/B compare vs single‑index search.  
- **Explainability 2.0 (M2):** top‑k path rationales; saliency snapshots; counterfactual hinting; provenance export; UX copy & A11y.  
- **Metering 1.0 GA:** signer rotation SOP; export scheduler; finance acceptance; customer export docs.  
- **Predictive GA‑candidate:** implement guardrails, quotas, rollback flows; model card 1.4 draft.  
- **Marketplace Discovery prototype:** source cards, license badges, DPIA summaries, request‑to‑connect flow.  
- **Onboarding factory v2:** one tenant; evidence bundle & policy sim.  
- **Ops hygiene:** alert budgets, warm cache heuristics v2, access review exports.

### Non‑Goals
- Federated Search production rollout beyond staging.  
- Marketplace transactions or billing—**discovery only**.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **FS latency & partials confusion** → strict timeouts; partial labeling; fallback to single index.  
- **XAI overload** → concise copy; export links; caveat banners.  
- **Metering regressions** → rotation rehearsal; replay checks; drift alarms.  
- **Predictive misuse** → quotas; audit sampling; rollback drills.  
- **Marketplace license mistakes** → badges from license registry; DPIA summaries; blocked flows.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- FS p95 & success; XAI export rate; invoice variance (≤0.3%); onboarding throughput; predictive audit sampling (≥99%); burn alarms (<45m).  
- Weekly: burndown, scope ledger, blocker aging.
