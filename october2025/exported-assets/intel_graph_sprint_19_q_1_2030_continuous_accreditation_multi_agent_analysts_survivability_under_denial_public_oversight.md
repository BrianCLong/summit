# 🗡️ Council of Spies & Strategists — Sprint 19 Plan (Q1 2030)

> Opening: “Accredit what acts, multiply the minds, endure denial, and keep the public faith.”

## Sprint Goal (14–21 days)
Reach **Continuous Accreditation** for autonomous/narrow actions and assurance flows, pilot **Multi‑Agent Analyst Teams** (cooperative AI agents under policy), harden **Survivability Under Denial** (no‑cloud, no‑IDP, no‑DNS modes), and operationalize **Public Oversight** artifacts (transparency statements + audit replay). Maintain verifiability, least privilege, and cost discipline.

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Continuous Accreditation (v1)
- **Control evidence streams:** auto‑collect artifacts per control family (AC, AU, CM, IA, SC, SI) mapped to autonomy and assurance.
- **Change‑risk attestations:** every change (model/policy/connector) emits risk class, blast radius, and rollback readiness proof.
- **Accred status pages:** live read‑only dashboards for accrediting authorities with control coverage, residual risk, and exceptions.

### 2) Multi‑Agent Analyst Teams (pilot)
- **Roles:** Planner (constraint‑aware), Skeptic (counter‑evidence hunter), Provenance Clerk (citation/ledger), Budgeteer (cost guard), and Ombuds (policy proofs).
- **Protocol:** turn‑based plan with critique, cost, and policy proofs; human lead approves steps; all agents cite evidence.
- **Sandbox:** operates only on snapshots/read‑only; outputs structured claims with confidence + dissent.

### 3) Survivability Under Denial (v1)
- **No‑cloud mode:** operate with local KMS/HSM, offline license tokens, and local identity cache; no external calls.
- **No‑IDP fallback:** short‑lived emergency credentials with device posture; local quorum unlock.
- **No‑DNS routing:** static peers for sync envelopes; signed host catalogs; operator runbooks.

### 4) Public Oversight Artifacts (v1)
- **Transparency statements:** machine‑readable, signed statements of purpose, data sources, models, and safeguards per disclosure bundle.
- **Audit replay:** publish replayable traces (queries, decisions, policies) with synthetic or redacted data to demonstrate process without sensitive content.
- **Community verifier:** hostable page for third parties to verify statements and replays against signatures.

### 5) Threat‑Led Validation (v1)
- **Kill‑chain scenarios:** red‑team sequences across OSINT+cyber+finance; agents must surface counter‑evidence and avoid automation traps.
- **Chaos+zero‑trust drills:** simultaneous outages (IDP + DNS) while maintaining evidence capture and audit integrity.
- **Cross‑partner incident:** incident room with treaty constraints; measure tempo and compliance under stress.

### 6) Operability & KPIs (v5)
- **Accred KPIs:** control coverage %, exception mean age, time‑to‑evidence.
- **Agent KPIs:** plan clarity score, counter‑evidence rate, cost per correct insight.
- **Denial KPIs:** RTO in no‑cloud/no‑IDP/no‑DNS modes; audit continuity rate.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Continuous Accreditation**
   - Control evidence streams populate status pages with ≥ 95% coverage for demo scope; every change emits risk/rollback attestations; exceptions tracked with owners/dates.
2. **Multi‑Agent Teams**
   - Agents produce a joint plan with critiques, cost forecasts, and policy proofs; at least one dissent recorded and resolved; outputs are read‑only with citations.
3. **Survivability**
   - No‑cloud, no‑IDP, and no‑DNS drills execute; tri‑pane + case work continue on snapshots; audit logs remain intact and verifiable.
4. **Public Oversight**
   - A disclosure publishes with a transparency statement and an **audit replay**; third‑party verifier validates signatures and replays without accessing sensitive data.
5. **Threat‑Led Validation**
   - Kill‑chain scenario handled with counter‑evidence surfaced; automation stays within policy; cross‑partner incident completes under treaty constraints.
6. **KPIs**
   - All KPI dashboards live; baseline metrics collected; alerts attached to thresholds.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 19)
- ACs pass on staging + one partner; security/ombuds approve public artifacts; docs updated (accreditation guide, multi‑agent SOP, denial modes, transparency policy, threat‑led testing); demo succeeds end‑to‑end.

---
## Demo Script
1. **Status page** shows control coverage; a change emits a risk attestation and rollback proof.
2. **Multi‑agent team** proposes a plan; Skeptic finds counter‑evidence; Ombuds blocks a step until policy proof is added; human lead approves.
3. **No‑cloud/no‑IDP/no‑DNS** drill: system stays operational on snapshots; audit continuity verified.
4. Publish a **transparency statement** and run an **audit replay**; community verifier validates.
5. Run a **kill‑chain** wargame across domains; agents avoid unsafe automation; cross‑partner incident completes under treaty.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** accreditation architecture, denial modes.
- **Backend (2):** evidence collectors, attestations, replay builder.
- **Frontend (2):** status dashboards, multi‑agent UI, verifier site.
- **Platform (1):** denial runbooks, chaos drills, KPI wiring.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** transparency schema, treaty/oversight review.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Accred scope creep** → start with high‑impact controls; automate evidence; clear exception process.
- **Agent overreach** → snapshot‑only; policy proofs mandatory; human lead approval; dissent preserved.
- **Denial fragility** → pre‑baked catalogs, local identity cache, signed deltas; drills.
- **Public misinterpretation** → layered statements with plain‑language glossaries; replay uses synthetic/redacted data.

---
## Metrics
- Accreditation: ≥ 95% evidence coverage; exception mean age trending down.
- Agents: ≥ 60% cases include counter‑evidence; plan clarity ≥ target; cost per correct insight ↓.
- Denial: RTOs within target; audit continuity 100%.
- Public oversight: 100% verifier success; zero data leakage.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **External auditor portal** with scoped access.
- **Agent marketplace** for certified, signed agent roles.
- **Denial‑mode autopilot** recommendations.

*Closing:* “Certify the machine, multiply prudence, survive any blackout, and keep your receipts.”
