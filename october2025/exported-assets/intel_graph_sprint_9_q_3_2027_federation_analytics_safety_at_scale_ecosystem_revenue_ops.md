# üó°Ô∏è Council of Spies & Strategists ‚Äî Sprint 9 Plan (Q3¬†2027)

> Opening: ‚ÄúScale the trust, tame the risks, and bind the network with mutual proofs.‚Äù

## Sprint Goal (14‚Äì21 days)
Advance **Federated Analytics** (privacy‚Äëpreserving cross‚Äëorg queries), mature **AI Safety & Governance (v3)** across all ML features, expand **Ecosystem Integrations** (SIEM/SOAR/EDR/Case tools), and stand up **Revenue Ops** (quotas, entitlements, renewals). Deliver **Accessibility & Internationalization polish** for broad deployments.

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Federated Analytics (v1)
- **Query types:** secure, aggregate‚Äëonly analytics across partner spaces using **policy contracts + proofs**; no raw row‚Äëlevel egress.
- **Privacy controls:** k‚Äëanonymity thresholds, DP noise (epsilon per contract), join‚Äësafe allowlists, outlier suppression.
- **Proofs:** attach computation manifest (inputs, policies, noise, seeds) and signatures for partner verification.

### 2) AI Safety & Governance (v3)
- **Global safety matrix:** map each model (ER, embeddings, anomaly, Graph‚ÄëRAG, supervised alerts) to risks, mitigations, tests, rollback.
- **Continuous eval:** shadow test sets, red‚Äëteam prompts, poisoning sims; gated deploy with scorecards and stop‚Äëthe‚Äëworld triggers.
- **User controls:** per‚Äëtenant safety posture (conservative/standard/experimental) with default guardrails and opt‚Äëin flows.

### 3) Ecosystem Integrations (v1)
- **SIEM/SOAR:** signed connectors for Splunk/Elastic/Qradar + Cortex/XSOAR; export alerts/cases under budget + policy.
- **EDR/NDR:** read‚Äëonly evidence pulls (hashes, detections) with provenance; no remote actions.
- **Case Tools:** ServiceNow/Jira Service Management sync of cases/tasks with signature + rollback.

### 4) Revenue Ops & Entitlements (v1)
- **Entitlement service:** feature checks at PEPs; time‚Äëboxed trials; edition upgrades/downgrades safely.
- **Renewals & invoicing:** renewal warnings, grace periods, entitlements change logs; signed invoices.
- **Reseller keys:** delegated tenant creation with scoped capabilities and audit.

### 5) Accessibility & Internationalization (v2)
- **A11y compliance:** WCAG¬†2.2 AA audit fixes (keyboard nav, color contrast, focus, captions); screen‚Äëreader flows for tri‚Äëpane.
- **i18n/l10n:** RTL support, pluralization rules, date/number/locales; translation packs for top 6 languages.
- **Docs localization:** quick‚Äëstart and operator guides localized.

### 6) Operability & SLOs (continued)
- **Federated analytics SLOs:** compute latency p95, verification success rate, DP budget usage.
- **Safety pipeline SLOs:** eval freshness, rollback MTTR, incident drill cadence.
- **Connector health:** uptime/MTTR per ecosystem connector with alerts.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Federated Analytics**
   - Aggregate query across two partners returns only DP‚Äëprotected results; manifests verify; k‚Äëanonymity satisfied; no row egress.
2. **AI Safety v3**
   - Safety scorecards exist for all models; red‚Äëteam suite runs nightly; a failing metric blocks deployment and raises alerts.
3. **Ecosystem**
   - Splunk and ServiceNow integrations function E2E with signed payloads and policy enforcement; rollback leaves no orphaned tasks.
4. **Revenue Ops**
   - Entitlement checks enforced at PEPs; trial to paid upgrade flows without downtime; invoices signed and downloadable.
5. **A11y & i18n**
   - WCAG¬†2.2 AA spot‚Äëaudit passes critical checks; tri‚Äëpane fully navigable via keyboard; RTL layouts render correctly.
6. **Operability**
   - SLO dashboards live for federated analytics and safety pipeline; alerts page routes to on‚Äëcall runbooks.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 9)
- All ACs pass on two‚Äëorg federation demo; security review clear; a11y/i18n audits recorded; docs updated (federated analytics guide, safety governance playbook, connector integration guides, pricing/renewals SOP); demo runs E2E.

---
## Demo Script
1. Run a federated aggregate query across Partner Spaces A & B; verify computation manifest and DP budgets; results show k‚Äëanon satisfied.
2. A model update fails red‚Äëteam tests; deployment blocked; rollback executed; scorecard archived.
3. Splunk receives signed alerts; ServiceNow synchronizes a case/task; a rollback removes artifacts cleanly.
4. Tenant upgrades from trial to Pro; entitlements flip at PEPs; signed invoice generated.
5. Toggle UI to Arabic (RTL); tri‚Äëpane remains fully usable via keyboard; screen reader announces tooltips.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** federated analytics & safety governance.
- **Backend (2):** DP gates, manifest signing, entitlements.
- **Frontend (2):** a11y/i18n, connector UIs.
- **Platform (1):** SLOs, red‚Äëteam harness, connector health.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** policy contracts, DP budgets, audits.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Re‚Äëidentification risk** ‚Üí strict k‚Äëanon + DP; deny small cohorts; audit manifests.
- **Integration drift** ‚Üí versioned connectors, contract tests; rollback tooling.
- **A11y regressions** ‚Üí automated axe scans + manual audits; CI gates.

---
## Metrics
- Federation: 0 row‚Äëlevel egress; ‚â• 99% manifest verification.
- Safety: 100% models with scorecards; rollback MTTR ‚â§ 30 min.
- Revenue: 100% entitlements enforced; invoice error rate < 0.5%.
- A11y: critical issues = 0; keyboard path coverage = 100%.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **Cross‚Äëorg cohort discovery** with secure enclaves.
- **Auto‚Äëgenerated a11y captions** for media via on‚Äëprem models.
- **Marketplace subscriptions** for connectors with revenue share.

*Closing:* ‚ÄúFederate only aggregates, sign every claim, and sell without surrendering trust.‚Äù
