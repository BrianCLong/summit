# 🗡️ Council of Spies & Strategists — Sprint 10 Plan (Q4 2027)

> Opening: “Let the system act—narrowly, verifiably, and under law.”

## Sprint Goal (14–21 days)
Graduate to **Trusted Autonomy (v1)** for narrow, policy‑bound actions, achieve **Gov‑Cloud GA** posture, stand up **Knowledge Markets** (internal & partner), and land a **Sustainment** program (SLAs, SRE, LTS branches). All automation remains **evidence‑backed, reversible, and budget‑governed**.

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Trusted Autonomy (v1)
- **Narrow action classes:** tag, label, case‑create/close, snapshot/export, notify; **no external actuator** unless signed connector with allowlist.
- **Tri‑party checks:** (Policy OPA + Safety Scorecard + Budget Guard) must all pass; failure → human review.
- **Confidence contracts:** action requires minimum evidence/score thresholds; includes rollback recipe.
- **Post‑action verifiers:** independent checks re‑compute evidence links and budget deltas; mismatches auto‑rollback.

### 2) Gov‑Cloud GA (v1)
- **FedRAMP‑aligned controls (subset):** CM, AC, IA, AU, SC families mapped; encryption KMS/HSM integrations; centralized audit shipping.
- **STIG baselines:** OS/db/app STIG scripts + compliance dashboards.
- **Tenant isolation proofs:** signed tests for cross‑tenant boundaries; backup/restore with crypto‑erasure evidence.

### 3) Knowledge Markets (v1)
- **Internal market:** publish/runbooks/queries/motifs with ratings, provenance, and usage metrics; budget costs visible.
- **Partner market (preview):** allowlisted federated **aggregates** (no row data) priced via DP budgets + compute time; manifests signed.
- **Revenue share:** usage metering and settlement stubs.

### 4) Sustainment & SRE (v1)
- **SLA tiers:** Pro/Enterprise/Gov SLO→SLA mapping with credits; incident comms templates.
- **LTS branches:** quarterly cut, backport policy; CVE fast‑path.
- **Chaos & fire drills:** quarterly program with evidence capture; RTO/RPO attestation exports.

### 5) Human Factors, Ethics & Training (v1)
- **Decision journals:** optional analyst reflections attached to actions; searchable.
- **Bias & fairness panels:** periodic review of alerts/ER decisions by Ombuds; remediation queue.
- **Training packs:** interactive labs for provenance, policy, redaction, and autonomous actions.

### 6) Operability & Observability (v3)
- **Autonomy dashboard:** approvals, denials, rollbacks, and savings; trace links to evidence and policies.
- **Gov‑cloud dashboards:** compliance posture, STIG drift, audit export health.
- **Market health:** top assets, DP spend, rejection reasons.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Trusted Autonomy**
   - At least two narrow action classes operate automatically under tri‑party checks; 100% actions have evidence bundles & rollback recipes; post‑action verifier mismatches auto‑rollback within minutes.
2. **Gov‑Cloud GA**
   - STIG scans pass for baseline hosts; audit shipping verified; tenant boundary tests signed; backup/restore with crypto‑erasure proof.
3. **Knowledge Markets**
   - Internal market items publish with provenance & budget costs; partner market returns DP‑protected aggregates with signed manifests; no row egress.
4. **Sustainment & SRE**
   - SLAs documented; a quarterly drill executed; LTS branch cut with one backport delivered.
5. **Human Factors & Ethics**
   - Decision journals enabled on actions; bias panel run produces remediation items with owners and due dates.
6. **Observability**
   - Dashboards live for autonomy, gov‑cloud compliance, and market health; alerts route to on‑call.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 10)
- All ACs pass in staging + one pilot tenant; security/ombuds reviews sign off; docs updated (autonomy safety case, gov‑cloud guide, market operations, SLA handbook); demo succeeds E2E.

---
## Demo Script
1. A **pattern→autonomous tag & case** executes after tri‑party checks; post‑action verifier confirms; rollback shown on forced mismatch.
2. **Gov‑cloud posture** dashboard shows STIG compliance; tenant boundary and backup/erasure proofs downloaded.
3. Analyst publishes a **runbook** to the internal market; partner runs a federated aggregate via market preview; DP budgets and signed manifests shown.
4. **Sustainment drill** executes; LTS branch backport deployed; incident comms template used.
5. **Ethics panel** reviews alert sampling; remediation tasks created; decision journals searchable.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** autonomy safety case, gov‑cloud posture.
- **Backend (2):** tri‑party checks, verifiers, tenant proofs, DP aggregates.
- **Frontend (2):** autonomy & market UIs, compliance dashboards.
- **Platform (1):** STIG/scan pipeline, LTS release mgmt, chaos drills.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** policy contracts, bias panels, docs.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Autonomy overreach** → narrow actions only; tri‑party checks; always reversible.
- **Compliance scope creep** → prioritize must‑haves; evidence packer; staged attestations.
- **Market leakage** → aggregates‑only with DP; signed manifests; deny small cohorts.

---
## Metrics
- Autonomy: ≥ 95% successful actions with zero unauthorized actuations; rollback MTTR ≤ 5 min.
- Gov‑cloud: 100% baseline STIG pass; 0 cross‑tenant leaks.
- Market: 0 row egress; ≥ 90% manifest verifications; DP budget over‑use = 0.
- Sustainment: SLO→SLA incidents with < 30 min page‑to‑ack; quarterly drill completed.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **Signed external actuators** (ticket openers, page/call) within tight budgets.
- **Auto‑deprecation** of stale market items.
- **Gov‑cloud artifact publisher** for auditors.

*Closing:* “Autonomy is privilege on probation—prove it on every action.”
