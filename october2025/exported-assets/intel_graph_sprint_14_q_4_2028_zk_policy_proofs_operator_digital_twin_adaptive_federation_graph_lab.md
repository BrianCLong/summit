# üó°Ô∏è Council of Spies & Strategists ‚Äî Sprint 14 Plan (Q4¬†2028)

> Opening: ‚ÄúProve without revealing, rehearse before risking, federate with finesse, and make discovery delightful.‚Äù

## Sprint Goal (14‚Äì21 days)
Advance trust and operability with **Zero‚ÄëKnowledge (ZK) Policy Proofs (pilot)**, stand up an **Operator Digital Twin** for rehearsing changes and incidents, ship **Adaptive Federation** controls for dynamic contracts, and deliver a **Research‚Äëgrade Graph Lab** for safe exploratory analysis. Land end‚Äëof‚Äëdecade **Roadmap & Product KPIs** refresh.

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Zero‚ÄëKnowledge Policy Proofs (pilot)
- **Property set (v0):** prove ‚Äúno row‚Äëlevel egress‚Äù and ‚Äúwarrant tag present on reveals‚Äù using succinct ZK proofs over computation manifests.
- **Proof pipeline:** compile policy predicates ‚Üí circuits; generate/verify proofs on export and federation responses.
- **Verifier UX:** partner‚Äëside lightweight verifier that validates signatures + ZK proofs without accessing protected rows.

### 2) Operator Digital Twin (v1)
- **Twin environment:** snapshot of topology, config, and anonymized workload replays.
- **Scenario engine:** rehearse upgrades, policy changes, surge traffic, data poison, and regional failover; scorecards captured.
- **What‚Äëif planner:** recommends roll steps, guardrails, and backout triggers before touching prod.

### 3) Adaptive Federation (v2)
- **Dynamic contracts:** time‚Äëboxed, purpose‚Äëscoped, label‚Äëaware federation agreements that auto‚Äëexpire; renewal workflows.
- **Policy negotiation:** pre‚Äëflight diff of partner policies; suggest least‚Äëprivilege contract satisfying both sides.
- **Runtime monitors:** DP budget consumption, k‚Äëanon cohort sizes, and warrant utilization with alerts.

### 4) Research‚Äëgrade Graph Lab (v1)
- **Isolated sandboxes:** analyst notebooks (read‚Äëonly snapshots) with NL‚ÜíCypher helpers, motif templates, and causal snippets; no writebacks.
- **Dataset versioning:** branch/commit model for graph snapshots with manifests; diff and publish to cases.
- **Export hygiene:** one‚Äëclick disclosure pack with citations and provenance; optional public verifier stub.

### 5) Product KPIs & Roadmap Refresh
- **North‚Äëstar metrics:** evidence verifiability rate, policy‚Äëexplained actions, analysis cost per decision, time‚Äëto‚Äëinsight, false‚Äëpositive rate.
- **Target bands 2029:** define thresholds per edition; add to SLO dashboards.
- **Quarterly OKR scaffolding:** roll up epics to measurable outcomes.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **ZK Proofs (pilot)**
   - Proofs attach to at least two flows (export, federated aggregate); partner verifier validates; attempts without warrants fail proof.
2. **Digital Twin**
   - Two rehearsals executed (upgrade + data‚Äëpoison); predicted risk aligns with prod pilot outcomes; backout triggers verified.
3. **Adaptive Federation**
   - Dynamic contract created, auto‚Äëexpires, and renews with audit; policy negotiation suggests a least‚Äëprivilege agreement that both sides accept.
4. **Graph Lab**
   - Notebook sandbox runs motif + causal snippets on snapshot; publishes results to a case without mutating live data; exports pass verifier.
5. **KPIs & Roadmap**
   - Metrics defined, instrumented, and displayed; OKR scaffolding linked to epics with baseline values.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 14)
- ACs pass on staging + one partner; security/ombuds review for ZK scope; docs updated (ZK primer, Twin playbook, Federation v2 guide, Graph Lab manual, KPI glossary); demo succeeds end‚Äëto‚Äëend.

---
## Demo Script
1. Export a disclosure bundle with **ZK proof** of ‚Äúno row egress‚Äù; partner verifies without row access.
2. Run an **upgrade rehearsal** in the Digital Twin; scenario reveals risk; planner proposes steps; prod pilot follows with zero incidents.
3. Negotiate an **adaptive federation contract**; auto‚Äëexpiry fires; renewal path logs approvals; runtime monitor shows DP budgets.
4. Analyst uses **Graph Lab** to explore motifs and a causal snippet; publishes findings into a case; verifier validates export.
5. KPI dashboard shows baselines and target bands; OKRs linked to current epics.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** ZK architecture, federation contracts.
- **Backend (2):** prover/verification pipelines, twin engine, contract runtime.
- **Frontend (2):** verifier UX, twin planner UI, Graph Lab notebooks, KPI dashboards.
- **Platform (1):** snapshot/versioning, workload replays, metrics wiring.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** ZK scope, contract reviews, public proofs.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **ZK complexity/perf** ‚Üí start with two properties; offload to batch; cache proofs; fall back to signed manifests.
- **Twin fidelity** ‚Üí anonymized replay calibration; compare predictions vs. pilots; iterate.
- **Contract deadlocks** ‚Üí provide suggested least‚Äëprivilege templates; human mediation path.
- **Notebook sprawl** ‚Üí sandboxes read‚Äëonly; enforced export hygiene.

---
## Metrics
- ZK: ‚â• 95% verifier success; proof gen time within budget on demo sizes.
- Twin: prediction vs. pilot variance within agreed bounds; rollback success = 100% in rehearsals.
- Federation: 0 contract overruns; DP budget breaches = 0.
- Graph Lab: 0 live mutations; ‚â• 50% analyst adoption in trials.
- KPIs: dashboards green; OKRs assigned to all active epics.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **ZK batching** for multi‚Äëquery proofs.
- **Auto‚Äësuggested federation contracts** from usage history.
- **Notebook ‚Üí Runbook** exporter to promote discoveries into signed playbooks.

*Closing:* ‚ÄúProve the negative, rehearse the disaster, federate by least privilege, and let curiosity flourish‚Äîsafely.‚Äù
