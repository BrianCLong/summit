# [MODE: WHITE+BLUE] Summit — Aggressive Gap-Closing Sprint (Oct 2–16, 2025)

**Classification:** Internal // Need-to-Know • **Objective:** Close highest-value security, resiliency, and governance gaps **without duplicating** existing or planned work in the Summit repo.

---

## A) Executive Summary (Decisions & Next Steps)
- **Spin up a two-week, hard-driving sprint** focused on control efficacy, provable compliance, and detection readiness across Summit’s production paths — *no rewrite, no churn*.
- **Create one Projects board** that mirrors the sprint plan below; map each Issue/PR to a control/test artifact; attach evidence to a shared `.evidence/` ledger.
- **Deliver audit-ready artifacts** (OPA policies, Sigma detections, IR runbooks, SBOM/ASBOM, and control attestations) with passing tests and rollbacks.
- **Quick wins first (48–72h)**: secrets scanning gates, branch protections, CODEOWNERS, baseline detections, and IR comms templates.

---

## B) Findings & Rationale (What / Why / So-What)
**Repository signals observed (no duplication zone):**
- **Existing areas** to respect and extend, not duplicate: `RUNBOOKS/`, `SECURITY/`, `controls/`, `audit/`, `.evidence/`, `alerting/`, `alertmanager/`, `analytics/`, `deploy/`, `charts/`, `airflow/dags/`, `companyos/`, `connectors/`, `ai-ml-suite/`, `benchmarks/`, `chaos/`, and `bug-bash-results/` (Sept 22, 2025).
- **Gaps/opportunities:**
  - No unified **Projects** board tying backlog to control objectives; Issues count is massive → visibility & triage risk.
  - Control intent exists in `controls/` but lacks **policy-as-code tests** and **compliance mapping** per change.
  - `RUNBOOKS/` exists, but response **RACI**, **evidence handling**, and **rollbacks** aren’t uniformly attached to services.
  - **Detection coverage** uneven vs likely TTPs for CI/CD compromise, secrets exposure, identity abuse, and data exfil.
  - **Provenance** scattered; `.evidence/` present but **no enforced attachment** to PRs/releases.

**So-What:** These create blind spots in prevention/detection, increase MTTR, and weaken audit posture. This sprint stitches governance → controls → detections → runbooks → evidence into one testable pipeline.

---

## C) Sprint Goals, Scope, and DoD-V
- **Goal 1 — Governance to Code:** Every critical control has an OPA/SRE test; PRs blocked when non-compliant.
- **Goal 2 — Detect & Respond:** High-fidelity detections for top-5 TTPs with routed alerts and runbooks.
- **Goal 3 — Provenance & Attestation:** Evidence attached at PR/Release with hashes, signers, and retention notes.
- **Goal 4 — Exposure Reduction:** Secrets, SBOM/ASBOM, infra drift, and identity blast-radius measurably reduced.

**Definition of Done (DoD-V):** Win conditions met **and** proofs attached **and** rollback verified **and** owners assigned.

---

## D) Sprint Plan (Two Weeks, Aggressive; no-duplication aware)
> **Rule:** Extend what exists; do not rewrite. If a folder already exists, augment with tests, mappings, or glue code.

### Track 0 — Program Setup (Day 0–1)
- **T0.1 Create `Projects` Board** (title: *“K++ Sprint 2025-10-02”*)
  - Columns: *Intake → Ready → Doing → Verify → Evidence Attached → Done*.
  - Add automations to require an **Evidence** checklist before “Done”.
- **T0.2 Label Set**: `k++`, `control`, `detection`, `runbook`, `opa`, `evidence`, `alpha`, `beta`, `blocked`, `rollback-required`.
- **T0.3 CODEOWNERS** in root (if absent) mapping critical dirs to named reviewers; require 2 approvals for `controls/`, `deploy/`, `airflow/`, `companyos/`.
- **DoD:** Board live; labels created; CODEOWNERS merged.

### Track 1 — Governance & OPA (Day 1–4)
- **T1.1 Control Catalog Glue** (extend `controls/`):
  - Add `controls/catalog.yaml` with IDs, owners, evidence paths, and mappings (NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, SOC2).
- **T1.2 OPA Bundle** (new `controls/opa/`):
  - Policies: `pr.guardrails.rego` (deny if missing tests/evidence), `sbom.gates.rego`, `branch.protection.rego`, `secrets.gates.rego`.
  - **Unit tests** under `controls/opa/tests/` with sample inputs; add GitHub Action step `opa test`.
- **T1.3 Compliance Mapping** (extend `audit/`):
  - Generate machine-readable mapping `audit/matrix-nist800-53.json` and `audit/matrix-iso27001.json`.
- **DoD:** PRs blocked on non-compliant changes; matrices render in CI summary.

### Track 2 — CI/CD Guardrails (Day 1–3)
- **T2.1 Secrets Scanning Gate** (extend existing):
  - Enable repo-wide secret scanning + push protection; add pre-commit hook in `.githooks/` and job in `.github/workflows/secrets.yml`.
  - Baseline suppression file with expiry dates to avoid churn; add auto-issue for any bypass.
- **T2.2 Branch Protections** (enforce):
  - Require signed commits and status checks; restrict force-push on `main`.
- **DoD:** All new pushes checked; documented in `SECURITY/controls.md`.

### Track 3 — SBOM/ASBOM & Supply Chain (Day 2–5)
- **T3.1 SBOM**: Add `sbom/` job using `syft` for each build; upload as artifact; attach to release.
- **T3.2 ASBOM** (AI/ML assets in `ai-ml-suite/`, `models/` if present): model cards, dataset hashes, license checks.
- **T3.3 Dependency Alerts**: Turn on Dependabot security updates and review rules; triage auto-PR flow.
- **DoD:** Release assets include SBOM & ASBOM; policy enforces presence.

### Track 4 — Detection Engineering (Day 2–8)
- **Targets:** CI/CD abuse, credential theft, data exfil, privilege escalation, and persistence.
- **T4.1 Sigma Rules** (new `alerting/sigma/`):
  - `ci.suspicious_runner_context.yml`, `git.abnormal_token_use.yml`, `cloud.exfil.unusual_egress.yml`, `iam.suspicious_role_assumption.yml`, `endpoint.persistence.scheduledtask.yml`.
- **T4.2 Routing** (extend `alertmanager/`):
  - Routes by severity to on-call; dedupe/quiet-hours policies.
- **T4.3 Dashboards** (extend `analytics/`): panels for **TTD**, **TTR**, **MTTR**, alert volume, FP rate, rule coverage.
- **DoD:** Alerts firing in test; dashboards populated with synthetic events.

### Track 5 — Incident Response & Runbooks (Day 3–9)
- **T5.1 Standardize RACI** across `RUNBOOKS/`; add `RUNBOOKS/_templates/incident.md` with roles, SLAs (declare, contain ≤ 60m), comms, and evidence steps.
- **T5.2 Playbooks**: `BEC-lite`, `Secrets Exposure`, `CI Pipeline Compromise`, `Rogue Admin`, `Data Exfil` — each with stepwise rollback.
- **T5.3 Evidence Handling**: `RUNBOOKS/_templates/evidence.md` (hash, signer, retention class).
- **DoD:** Tabletop executed, action items logged in `bug-bash-results/`.

### Track 6 — Identity & Access Quick Wins (Day 4–7)
- **T6.1 Least Privilege Sweep**: scripts to enumerate tokens/keys; revoke stale access; rotate critical secrets via `crypto/kms` paths where relevant.
- **T6.2 ABAC for Sensitive Ops**: `controls/opa/abac.rego` to allow by context (ticket, owner, time window) for prod deploys.
- **DoD:** Token inventory + revocation log in `.evidence/identity/`.

### Track 7 — Data & Pipelines (Day 5–9)
- **T7.1 Data Classification Glue**: `data/_classification.yaml` (public/internal/confidential/restricted) and input validators.
- **T7.2 Airflow Guardrails**: DAG policy checks for external egress, PII touchpoints, and secrets-in-variables.
- **DoD:** DAGs failing policy cannot merge; lineage shows classification tags.

### Track 8 — Chaos & Resilience (Day 8–12)
- **T8.1 Failure Injection** (extend `chaos/`): inject identity provider outage and S3/GCS 5xx flaps; measure MTTR.
- **T8.2 Backup/Restore Drill**: verify RTO/RPO; document in `RUNBOOKS/restore.md`.
- **DoD:** Post-action report with residual risk and next steps.

### Track 9 — Communications & Training (Day 10–12)
- **T9.1 Comms Templates** in `comms/templates/`: customer, regulator, internal exec; pre-approved phrases.
- **T9.2 Micro-drills**: 30-min tabletop for each playbook; capture learnings in `.evidence/tabletops/`.
- **DoD:** All templates versioned; drills recorded and linked to Issues.

### Track 10 — Closeout & Attestation (Day 13–14)
- **T10.1 Victory Ledger Update**: finalize `Victory Plan`, attach hashes/signers for all artifacts.
- **T10.2 Scorecard** in `analytics/`: final TTD/TTR/MTTR, control coverage %, FP/FN, incident severity dist.
- **T10.3 PAR** (Post-Action Review): residual risks + next sprint backlog.
- **DoD:** Green status on victory artifacts; signed release notes.

## H) Proof-Carrying Analysis (PCA)
**Assumptions:**
- We **do not duplicate** existing content in `RUNBOOKS/`, `SECURITY/`, `controls/`, `audit/`, `alerting/`, `analytics/`, `deploy/`, `airflow/`, `chaos/`, `bug-bash-results/`.
- Uploaded intel archives exist but were not parsed here; sprint focuses on *glue and enforcement* rather than new intel content.

**Evidence & Sources:**
- Summit repo structure indicating existing areas and large Issues backlog (observed on Oct 2, 2025).
- Internal doctrine file `dirkIG-V.md` (Victory Doctrine, DoD-V, provenance requirements).
- Industry baselines: NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, SOC 2, MITRE ATT&CK (for TTP scoping).

**Caveats:**
- Specific Issue references and current CI config checks weren’t enumerated here; first 24h of sprint should sync the Projects board with actual Issues/PRs.
- Some directories may be archived or deprecated; verify before attaching policies/tests.

**Verification & Checks:**
- Add CI steps that fail the build if: SBOM/ASBOM missing, OPA tests failing, Sigma pack not loaded in test harness, or runbook missing for a new alert.
- Run one tabletop per playbook with documented timings (declare ≤15m; contain ≤60m).

---

## I) Regression Risks & Watchouts
- Over-eager policy gates can block urgent hotfixes → include **break-glass** path with approval + full evidence capture.
- Secrets push protection may yield false positives → use suppression files with **expiry**.
- Alert noise → iterate thresholds and add suppression windows with clear owner sign-off.

---

## J) RACI & Owners (Fill-in at Kickoff)
- **Accountable (A):** Security Lead
- **Responsible (R):** Platform Eng (CI/CD), SRE, Data Eng, App Sec, IR Lead
- **Consulted (C):** Legal, Privacy, Product, Comms
- **Informed (I):** Exec Sponsor, Support

---

## K) Next 48–72 Hours (Checklist)
- [ ] Enable secret scanning + push protection; land `.github/workflows/secrets.yml`
- [ ] Add CODEOWNERS; enforce signed commits & required checks
- [ ] Create Projects board; tag top-30 high-signal Issues into this sprint
- [ ] Land `controls/opa/*.rego` + tests; wire CI
- [ ] Draft Sigma top-5; validate in test harness; route to on-call
- [ ] Standardize `RUNBOOKS/_templates/*` and publish comms templates
- [ ] Generate SBOM/ASBOM on next build; attach to release; enforce via OPA gate
- [ ] Start token inventory & revoke stale creds; record in `.evidence/identity/`

---

## L) Definition of Ready (DoR) for Each Work Item
- **Clear owner, control/OKR mapping, acceptance criteria, test/evidence path, rollback plan**, and a link to related code paths.

---

## M) Success Metrics (Sprint Exit)
- **TTD ≤ 10m** for injected CI abuse & secrets exposure
- **MTTR ≤ 90m** for simulated BEC-lite
- **Control coverage ≥ 85%** (controls with passing OPA tests)
- **Evidence attachment ≥ 95%** of merged PRs/releases
- **Secrets incidents: 0**
