# 🗡️ Council of Spies & Strategists — Sprint 18 Plan (Q4 2029)

> Opening: “When domains converge, bind them by contracts, test them by attack, and coordinate under fire.”

## Sprint Goal (14–21 days)
Unify intelligence across heterogeneous domains via **Cross‑Domain Schema Unification**, enforce **Evidence Use Contracts** end‑to‑end, operationalize **Crisis Interoperability** with partner agencies, and graduate **AI Red‑Teaming** to GA with continuous attack simulation. Maintain strict provenance, policy, and budget constraints.

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Cross‑Domain Schema Unification (v1)
- **Ontology bridge:** map cyber (alerts/indicators), finance (accounts/transactions), HUMINT (persons/assets), OSINT (documents/events) into a **composable canonical** with JSON‑LD contexts.
- **Facet views:** domain‑specific lenses (Cyber, Finance, HUMINT, OSINT) over the same entities/claims with policy labels.
- **Conflict adjudication:** rules for field precedence, unit conversions, and contradictory claims; attach dissent as structured counter‑claims.

### 2) Evidence Use Contracts (v1)
- **Contract DSL:** machine‑readable use terms (purpose, TLP/classification, redistribution, retention, attribution) bound to evidence at ingest.
- **Runtime enforcement:** contracts propagate to queries, exports, and playbooks; violations blocked with explain‑why + remediation path.
- **Compliance reports:** per‑tenant/partner ledger of contract compliance, breaches, and remedial actions with signatures.

### 3) Crisis Interoperability (v1)
- **Incident rooms:** time‑boxed Partner Spaces with treaty presets, pre‑approved queries, and crisis SLOs.
- **Battle rhythm:** injects (intel updates) + SITREP runbook; auto‑generate disclosure packs for J2/J3 audiences.
- **Interop gateways:** signed, rate‑limited feeds for SIEM/SOAR/Case tools; fail‑safe backpressure + replay.

### 4) AI Red‑Teaming GA (v1)
- **Attack library:** prompt‑injection, retrieval‑poisoning, model‑evasion, data‑leak, and policy‑bypass suites with severity scoring.
- **Continuous simulation:** scheduled attacks against Graph‑RAG, copilot, anomaly, and supervised alerting; scorecards and regression gates in CI/CD.
- **Response playbooks:** auto‑open incidents with mitigations (policy tweaks, retriever hardening, deny‑lists) and verification tests.

### 5) Explainable Decision Trails (v1)
- **Decision graph:** link hypotheses, queries, evidence, model outputs, human decisions, automations, and outcomes.
- **Story export:** narrative with embedded citations and policy reasons; declass‑ready views using Evidence Use Contracts.
- **Counter‑narrative view:** show rejected paths and counter‑evidence to reduce hindsight bias.

### 6) Operability, SLOs & Training
- **Cross‑domain SLOs:** time‑to‑unified‑entity, conflict resolution latency, lens render p95.
- **Contract compliance SLOs:** breach detection MTTA, remediation MTTR.
- **Crisis drills:** quarterly wargame with partners; scored by tempo, accuracy, and compliance.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Unification**
   - Entities from cyber+finance+HUMINT+OSINT map into a single canonical with facet lenses; contradictory claims represented with dissent and provenance.
2. **Evidence Contracts**
   - Contract DSL attaches at ingest; attempted violation (e.g., redistribution forbidden) is blocked with a clear explanation and remediation; compliance report exports for demo tenants.
3. **Crisis Interop**
   - Incident room stood up between two partners; pre‑approved queries run; SITREP bundles delivered; backpressure/replay protect feeds under surge.
4. **AI Red‑Team GA**
   - Continuous simulations run weekly; a failing defense blocks deployment; incident response applies mitigation and verifies fix.
5. **Decision Trails**
   - Decision graph renders for a case; story export compiles with citations and policy reasons; counter‑narrative includes rejected evidence paths.
6. **SLOs/Training**
   - Cross‑domain TTE < target; contract breach MTTA/MTTR within targets; partners complete crisis drill with passing score.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 18)
- ACs pass on multi‑tenant + partner staging; security/ombuds approve contracts and red‑team scopes; docs updated (unification guide, contract DSL, crisis SOPs, red‑team GA, decision trails); demo succeeds E2E.

---
## Demo Script
1. Ingest mixed cyber/finance/HUMINT/OSINT; **unified entities** with facet lenses appear; conflicting claims shown with dissent + provenance.
2. A **contract‑forbidden export** is blocked; operator sees why + remediation; compliance report exported.
3. Create **incident room**; run pre‑approved queries; deliver SITREP; surge triggers gateway backpressure and safe replay.
4. **Red‑team** run fails a poisoning defense; CI blocks; mitigation applied; rerun passes; deployment proceeds.
5. **Decision trail** exported with narrative + counter‑narrative; declass view respects contracts.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** unification & contracts architecture.
- **Backend (2):** ontology bridge, contract runtime, interop gateways.
- **Frontend (2):** facet lenses, incident rooms, decision trails UI.
- **Platform (1):** CI/CD gates, attack scheduler, SLO wiring.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** contract policy, red‑team scope, declass alignment.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Schema clashes** → explicit conflict/dissent model; mapping tests; domain SMEs sign‑off.
- **Contract complexity** → start with core terms; tooling for explains; remediation wizard.
- **Crisis surge** → backpressure + replay; minimal pre‑approved queries.
- **Red‑team fatigue** → rotate scenarios; scorecards; alert budgets.

---
## Metrics
- Unification: ≥ 95% lens render success; conflict adjudication latency within target.
- Contracts: 0 unauthorized redistributions; breach MTTA/MTTR within targets.
- Crisis: SITREP delivery p95 within target; feed replay success ≥ 99%.
- Red‑team: 100% runs gated; mean time to fix failing defense within target.
- Decision trails: 100% of demo cases export with narrative + counter‑narrative.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **Schema federation** with external ontologies (UCO, NIST CPE/CWE) via adapters.
- **Contract visualizer** for data‑flow diagrams.
- **Crisis tabletop generator** with scenario templates.

*Closing:* “Unify the picture, bind the rules, drill the crisis, and keep adversaries on the back foot.”
