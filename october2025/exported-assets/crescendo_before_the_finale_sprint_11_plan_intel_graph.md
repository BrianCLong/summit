# ðŸš€ Crescendo Before the Finale â€” Sprint 11 (Day 148â€“161)

**Start:** 2026â€‘02â€‘26  
**Duration:** 14 days  
**Prime Directive:** Stage the kill shot. Convert SHOCKWAVE outcomes into certifiable, referenceable, and scalable proofâ€”then sand every rough edge. No duplication of S1â€“S10. This is the penultimate push before the finale.

---
## Nonâ€‘Dup Boundary (inherits S1â€“S10)
Do **not** rebuild: prov/attestation & universal receipts; policy lifecycle + formal proofs; ZTDP & sovereign/noâ€‘egress; WORM/WORM+; ERâ€‘XAI v5; Disclosure Bundler + reply/eâ€‘file; GraphRAG + PiT + replay; Planner 3.x + caches + p99 killbox; FinOps/billing/entitlements + overage/dunning; streaming/CDC â‰¥250k/min; offline kits + DR + multiâ€‘region A/A; chaos/fuzzing v2; SOCâ€‘lite/auditor UX; adapter factory; predictive governance; blue/green perâ€‘tenant; IAP; 1MH trial; Subâ€‘1s p95; Board/Regulator binders.

---
## Sprint Objectives
1) **External Attestation Ready:** evidence bundles mapped to a thirdâ€‘party audit checklist (privacy, provenance, policy, DR, receipts).  
2) **Blackâ€‘Start + Region Partition:** prove recovery from zero with receipts and no policy regressions.  
3) **Scale Ã—2 & Cost â†“:** push to **2M nodes/hour** trial in staging; cut infra $/case by another 10% without SLO pain.  
4) **Sovereign Rotation:** sealed build + key rotation across one sovereign tenant in blue/green with receipts.  
5) **Customer Proof & ROI:** publish two anonymized case studies with endâ€‘toâ€‘end receipts and reproducible demos.

## Workstreams

### CRâ€‘1 â€” External Attestation Binder v2 (Auditâ€‘Ready)
**Lead:** @opsâ€‘audit â€¢ **Areas:** `docs/`, `prov-ledger/`, `governance/`, `analytics/`
- [ ] Map evidence to external checklist (privacy budgets, policy proofs, receipts, DR attestations, buildâ†’runtime chain).  
- [ ] Oneâ€‘click **Attestation Binder** export (auditor persona) with verifier scripts and fixtures.  
- [ ] Gap list + owner assignments for missing artifacts; automate weekly attest.
- **DoD:** Auditor persona reproduces all checks on clean machine; gaps list closed or waived with rationale.

### CRâ€‘2 â€” Blackâ€‘Start & Partition Drill
**Lead:** @sreâ€‘hawk â€¢ **Areas:** `deploy/`, `RUNBOOKS/`, `gateway/`, `storage/`
- [ ] Simulate **blackâ€‘start** (fresh control plane, cold caches, sealed builds) with scripted bringâ€‘up.  
- [ ] **Region partition** chaos: stale policy, delayed ingest, cache inconsistency; receipts stitched postâ€‘heal.  
- [ ] Blackâ€‘start/partition playbooks, timers, and attestation bundles.
- **DoD:** Blackâ€‘start <60m to green SLOs; partition heals with no policy breaches; receipts prove order of operations.

### CRâ€‘3 â€” 2MH Scale Trial & Cost Squeeze
**Lead:** @ingestâ€‘warden â€¢ **Areas:** `connectors/`, `data-pipelines/`, `graph-service/`, `finops/`
- [ ] Shard expansion + backpressure choreography; batch receipts per shard/offset.  
- [ ] Planner 3.x telemetry hints â†’ autoâ€‘materialization of hot subgraphs.  
- [ ] Storage tiering + TTL audits; compute rightâ€‘sizing; cache hitâ€‘rate targets.
- **DoD:** **2,000,000 nodes/hour** sustained Ã—2h; p95 read unchanged; infra $/case âˆ’10% vs S10; replay determinism intact.

### CRâ€‘4 â€” Sovereign Rotation & Key Hygiene
**Lead:** @sreâ€‘hawk â€¢ **Areas:** `kms/`, `deploy/`, `planner/`, `gateway/`
- [ ] Perâ€‘tenant key rotation with planâ€‘cache invalidation + receipts.  
- [ ] Blue/green sealed build rotation for a sovereign tenant; attestation chain captured.  
- [ ] Breakâ€‘glass tested with dualâ€‘control and receipts.
- **DoD:** Rotation completes without downtime; receipts link keyâ†’planâ†’runtime; breakâ€‘glass logged and reversible.

### CRâ€‘5 â€” ERâ€‘XAI v6 (Fairness & "Whyâ€‘Not")
**Lead:** @erâ€‘wright â€¢ **Areas:** `graph-xai/`, `featurestore/`, `apps/web/`
- [ ] Fairness slices by locale/region/time; thresholds tuned; drift alarms.  
- [ ] **Whyâ€‘not merged** counterâ€‘explanations promoted to firstâ€‘class artifacts in disclosures.  
- [ ] Goldenâ€‘set refresh; auditors can replay adjudication decisions.
- **DoD:** +1â€“2pp F1 without slice regressions; counterâ€‘explanations export with receipts; adjudications replay deterministically.

### CRâ€‘6 â€” Adapter Factory Surge (4 More + Badge Wall)
**Lead:** @ingestâ€‘warden â€¢ **Areas:** `connectors/`, `contracts/`, `ci/`, `docs/`
- [ ] Add four adapters via scaffold; badges (Licenseâ€‘Safe, Deterministic Replay, WORMâ€‘Ready).  
- [ ] Contract tests gate merges; ROI snippets packaged.
- **DoD:** 4 adapters merged; badges issued; throughput/contract checks green.

### CRâ€‘7 â€” Board Stories & ROI Proofs
**Lead:** @briefâ€‘smith â€¢ **Areas:** `apps/web/`, `exports/`, `docs/`
- [ ] Two anonymized case studies (fraud/safety or diligence) with **receipts at every step**.  
- [ ] ROI calculator bound to usage + disclosure velocity; shareable signed snapshot.  
- **DoD:** Case studies export as verifiable bundles; ROI snapshot signed and linked from Board Binder.

### CRâ€‘8 â€” DevEx Evidence Discipline v4
**Lead:** @devrel â€¢ **Areas:** `ci/`, `examples/`, `sdks/`
- [ ] PR gate enforces **artifact quartet**: fixtures, verifier output, receipts, perf deltas.  
- [ ] Demo batteries include blackâ€‘start + partition + sovereign rotation.  
- **DoD:** 100% merges pass quartet; demo battery p90 <12 min; docs autogen with verifier links.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Blackâ€‘start brittleness** â†’ rehearsals, staged bringâ€‘up, receipts for every step.  
- **2MH cost spikes** â†’ targeted materializations + TTL audits + backpressure.  
- **Rotation outages** â†’ planâ€‘cache invalidation + blue/green + breakâ€‘glass receipts.  
- **Fairness drift** â†’ slice dashboards + alarms + adjudication overrides with receipts.  
- **Evidence fatigue** â†’ automate exports; compress receipts into humanâ€‘readable views.

**Penultimate push: prove scale, prove sovereignty, prove ROIâ€”then leave the finale nowhere to hide.**
