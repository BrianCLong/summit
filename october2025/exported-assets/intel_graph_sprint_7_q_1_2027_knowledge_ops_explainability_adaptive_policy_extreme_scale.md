# üó°Ô∏è Council of Spies & Strategists ‚Äî Sprint 7 Plan (Q1¬†2027)

> Opening: ‚ÄúInstitutionalize the craft: make knowledge flow, make models speak, and make the system bend‚Äînever break‚Äîunder load.‚Äù

## Sprint Goal (14‚Äì21 days)
Stand up **Knowledge Ops** (living playbooks, lessons-learned, model/library versioning), **Explainability Everywhere** (human-auditable reasons for ER, similarity, alerts, Graph‚ÄëRAG), **Adaptive Policy** (contextual rules with tests), and **Extreme Scale** tuning (billion‚Äëedge readiness). Prepare **Rev/Packaging** for GA tiers.

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Knowledge Ops (v1)
- **Runbook lifecycle:** draft‚Üíreview‚Üípublish‚Üídeprecate with signatures and compatibility metadata.
- **Lessons‚Äëlearned vault:** attach post‚Äëmortems, incident learnings, and countermeasures to cases and runbooks.
- **Versioned library:** queries, motifs, prompts; semantic search with provenance and policy tags.

### 2) Explainability Everywhere (v2)
- **Unified Explain API:** ER features + thresholds; similarity neighbors + contribution scores; alert classifier rationale; Graph‚ÄëRAG passage/edge attributions.
- **Evidence mapping:** clickable path from score‚Üífeatures‚Üíevidence nodes/edges‚Üísource files.
- **Audit bundle integration:** explanations exported with decisions.

### 3) Adaptive Policy (v1)
- **Contextual rules:** time, location, label density, user role, and case state affect caps and budgets.
- **Policy tests:** declarative unit tests for OPA rules; canary mode with shadow evaluation and diffs.
- **Policy insights:** heatmaps of denials, overrides, exceptions; suggestions for simplification.

### 4) Extreme Scale (v1)
- **Billion‚Äëedge readiness:** memory‚Äëtiering, compressed adjacencies, on‚Äëdisk iterators; sampled analytics.
- **Query broker++:** smarter routing, pre‚Äëmaterialized motifs, incremental views.
- **Perf SLOs:** p95 6‚Äëhop < 2.8s; nightly scale test with synthetic + real mixes.

### 5) Packaging & GA Readiness (v1)
- **Editions:** Community (local), Pro (single‚Äëtenant), Enterprise (multi‚Äëtenant/federation), Gov (air‚Äëgap/offline kit).
- **Licensing & metering:** feature flags + usage metrics; offline metering tokens for Gov.
- **Docs & enablement:** admin guides, architecture blueprints, pricing page drafts.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Knowledge Ops**
   - Runbooks carry lifecycle metadata and signatures; lessons‚Äëlearned linked to at least two demos; library search returns policy‚Äëpermitted items with provenance.
2. **Explainability**
   - All model outputs displayed in UI have an Explain view with evidence links; export bundles include explanation artifacts.
3. **Adaptive Policy**
   - Canary policy tests run on production logs (shadow) and produce diffs; at least 2 policy simplifications merged.
4. **Extreme Scale**
   - Scale test achieves p95 6‚Äëhop < 2.8s on 1B‚Äëedge reference; broker shows >25% cache hit uplift for motifs.
5. **Packaging**
   - Editions gated via flags; usage metrics populate metering dashboard; Gov offline tokens validate.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 7)
- ACs pass; security review clears; scale tests green; docs complete (Explain guide, Policy testing manual, Scale playbook, Edition matrix); demo runs end‚Äëto‚Äëend.

---
## Demo Script
1. PM promotes a draft runbook; signatures verified; prior incidents linked in lessons‚Äëlearned vault.
2. Analyst opens Explain on ER + alert; walks backward to features‚Üíevidence‚Üísource; exports audit bundle with explanations.
3. Ops enables a contextual policy in canary; denies noisy queries; insights propose simplification; diffs reviewed and merged.
4. Scale test dashboard shows 1B‚Äëedge run meeting SLOs; broker cache hit uplift and motif pre‚Äëmaterialization evidence.
5. Admin toggles edition flags; metering reflects features; Gov offline token validates.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** Explain API, scale architecture.
- **Backend (2):** policy engine, broker, lifecycle store.
- **Frontend (2):** Explain UI, library/search, policy insights.
- **Platform (1):** scale harness, metering, flags.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** signature flows, policy tests.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Explain complexity** ‚Üí unify contracts; progressive disclosure; performance budgets.
- **Policy regressions** ‚Üí shadow canary + tests; staged rollout.
- **Scale surprises** ‚Üí nightly tests + sampled analytics; memory tiering.

---
## Metrics
- Explain availability: 100% of surfaced model outputs.
- Policy: ‚â• 30% reduction in noisy denials; zero unauthorized allowances.
- Scale: p95 6‚Äëhop < 2.8s; broker cache hit +25%.
- Packaging: 100% correct feature gating; metering accuracy ‚â• 99%.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **Interactive provenance heatmap** per subgraph.
- **Natural‚Äëlanguage Explain** (templated, evidence‚Äëlinked).
- **Auto‚Äëpolicy suggestions** via mined usage patterns.

*Closing:* ‚ÄúCodify the craft; let explanations travel with power.‚Äù
