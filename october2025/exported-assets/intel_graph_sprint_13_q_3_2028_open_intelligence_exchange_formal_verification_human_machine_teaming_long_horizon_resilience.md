# 🗡️ Council of Spies & Strategists — Sprint 13 Plan (Q3 2028)

> Opening: “Make exchange safe, make proofs routine, make the machine a partner, and make the system endure.”

## Sprint Goal (14–21 days)
Establish an **Open Intelligence Exchange** pattern (standards‑aligned, aggregates‑only), introduce **Formal Verification** for core policies and manifests, deepen **Human‑Machine Teaming** for complex analysis, and strengthen **Long‑Horizon Resilience** (auto‑repair, disaster exercises, sovereign footprints).

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Open Intelligence Exchange (v1)
- **Standards bridge:** import/export adapters for STIX 2.1 (observed‑data, relationships), CASE, and JSON‑LD context for our canonical schema.
- **Aggregate lenses:** pre‑defined, DP‑protected aggregate views (no row egress) with policy contracts and purpose bindings.
- **Exchange governance:** catalog of shareable assets with provenance, license, retention, and redistribution rules surfaced.

### 2) Formal Verification & Proofs (v1)
- **Policy proofs:** translate critical OPA rules to a decidable core; verify properties (no unlabeled cross‑tenant reads; warrant gating for reveals) using SMT solver.
- **Manifest invariants:** prove transform chains are acyclic, signed, and time‑ordered; verify erasure proofs reference valid snapshots.
- **Continuous checks:** proofs run in CI on policy/manifest changes; failing proofs block merges and emit human‑readable counterexamples.

### 3) Human‑Machine Teaming (v1)
- **Collaborative hypotheses:** analysts create hypothesis cards; copilot suggests evidence pulls, counter‑evidence, and alternative hypotheses with confidence & cost.
- **Disagreement surfacing:** model vs. human judgments highlighted; adjudication captures rationale and feeds learning loop.
- **Explainable planning:** copilot shows plan graph (steps, inputs, cost, policies) before running any step.

### 4) Long‑Horizon Resilience (v1)
- **Auto‑repairers:** detectors for index drift, corrupt snapshots, and broken lineage; safe repair playbooks with previews.
- **Regional sovereignty:** deployable footprints with explicit residency routers and offline envelopes; fail‑closed inter‑region links.
- **Annual disaster exercise kit:** scripted black‑sky scenarios (loss of region, credential compromise, data poison) with scoring and evidence capture.

### 5) Evidence Economics & Prioritization (v1)
- **Value/Cost scoring:** rank evidence by marginal value vs. retrieval/compute cost; suggest next‑best, lower‑cost alternatives.
- **Budget‑aware runs:** plans optimize for budget caps; UI presents trade‑offs; chosen path recorded for audit.

### 6) UX & Enablement (v4)
- **Exchange console:** publish/subscribe to aggregate lenses with proofs and policy contracts displayed.
- **Proof dashboard:** policy/manifest proofs with pass/fail and counterexamples; drill‑downs to offending rules.
- **Teaming views:** hypothesis boards, plan graphs, and disagreement timelines.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Open Exchange**
   - Export/import STIX observed‑data + relationships with preserved provenance; aggregate lenses enforce DP and policy contracts; no row‑level egress.
2. **Formal Verification**
   - Key properties proven in CI for target policies/manifests; failing proofs block merges and show counterexamples that reproduce locally.
3. **Human‑Machine Teaming**
   - Hypothesis cards + plan graphs operational; disagreement capture feeds learning; at least one case shows alternative‑hypothesis discovery.
4. **Resilience**
   - Auto‑repairers fix seeded lineage/snapshot problems without data loss; regional sovereignty test denies out‑of‑residency flows; disaster exercise runs with scored report.
5. **Evidence Economics**
   - Next‑best recommendations reduce median analysis cost ≥ 20% on demo set without loss of decision quality.
6. **UX**
   - Exchange console and proof dashboard complete primary tasks; all flows are policy‑explained and audited.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 13)
- ACs pass on multi‑tenant staging and one partner exchange; proofs active in CI; docs updated (exchange standards, formal proofs guide, teaming playbook, sovereignty deployment); demo succeeds end‑to‑end.

---
## Demo Script
1. Publish an **aggregate lens**; partner imports via STIX; DP/policy contract shown; manifest/provenance preserved.
2. A policy change fails formal proof; CI blocks; counterexample explains cross‑tenant leak; rule fixed; proofs pass.
3. Analyst drafts a **hypothesis**; copilot proposes a budget‑aware plan; alternative hypothesis discovered; disagreement captured and learned.
4. Auto‑repair fixes a broken lineage chain; **regional sovereignty** blocks an illegal route; disaster exercise report generated.
5. **Proof dashboard** displays passing invariants; operator drills into prior failure counterexample.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** formal proofs & exchange governance.
- **Backend (2):** adapters, proofs pipeline, auto‑repairers.
- **Frontend (2):** exchange console, proof dashboard, teaming boards.
- **Platform (1):** sovereignty footprints, disaster kit, CI gates.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** DP contracts, policy properties, ethics review.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Standards mismatch** → maintain mapping docs; round‑trip tests; community feedback.
- **Proof complexity** → start with narrow critical properties; human‑readable counterexamples; staged rollout.
- **Over‑automation of plans** → present alternatives & costs; human approval always required for actions.
- **Auto‑repair missteps** → dry‑run previews; read‑only checks; rollback.

---
## Metrics
- Exchange: 0 row egress; ≥ 99% valid manifest imports.
- Proofs: 100% target policies/manifests gated by CI proofs; mean time to fix failed proofs < 1 day.
- Teaming: ≥ 30% of cases use hypothesis cards; disagreement captured in ≥ 70% of adjudications.
- Resilience: ≥ 90% seeded issues auto‑repaired; disaster exercise pass score ≥ target.
- Economics: median analysis cost −20% with stable decision accuracy.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **Zero‑knowledge proofs** for select policy properties.
- **Open exchange directory** with discoverability and reputation.
- **Operator digital twin** to rehearse upgrades and disasters.

*Closing:* “Prove the rules, publish only aggregates, plan with the machine, and outlast the storm.”
