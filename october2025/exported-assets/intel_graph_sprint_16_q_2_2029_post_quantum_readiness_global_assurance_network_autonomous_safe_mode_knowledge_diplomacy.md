# 🗡️ Council of Spies & Strategists — Sprint 16 Plan (Q2 2029)

> Opening: “When ciphers age and alliances shift, keep proofs strong, autonomy humble, and knowledge exchange lawful.”

## Sprint Goal (14–21 days)
Prepare for **post‑quantum cryptography (PQC)** across artifacts and channels, launch a **Global Assurance Network** for cross‑org verification, introduce **Autonomous Safe Mode** (narrow auto‑containment under crisis), and stand up **Knowledge Diplomacy** workflows (treaties/agreements with proof obligations). Fortify long‑term archival integrity.

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Post‑Quantum Readiness (v1)
- **Hybrid signatures:** dual‑stack signing (classical + PQC: Dilithium/Falcon) for manifests, bundles, disclosures.
- **Key migration kit:** tenant‑scoped migration wizard (inventory → rotate → re‑sign hot artifacts → schedule cold re‑sign); attested.
- **Compat layer:** negotiate per‑partner crypto profiles; downgrade‑with‑warning when PQC unsupported; audit reasons.

### 2) Global Assurance Network (v1)
- **Public verification nodes:** lightweight, read‑only endpoints to verify Assurance Bundles, DP budgets, ZK proofs, and timestamps.
- **Transparency feeds:** opt‑in, privacy‑safe publish of proof counters (volumes, freshness, failures) per tenant/partner.
- **Revocation & freshness:** CRLs/OCSP‑like endpoints for revoked keys, expired proofs; SDK auto‑checks.

### 3) Autonomous Safe Mode (v1)
- **Crisis triggers:** explicit allowlist (data‑poison storm, exfil attempt, policy store corruption, budget runaways) detected by monitors.
- **Containment actions:** freeze write paths, downgrade automation to notify‑only, enable strict budgets, switch to air‑gap sync envelopes.
- **Return‑to‑service:** colored banner, checklist workflow, cause capture; stepwise re‑enable with audit artifacts.

### 4) Knowledge Diplomacy (v1)
- **Treaty builder:** machine‑readable agreements (purpose, allowed aggregates, DP budgets, retention, residency, proofs required) signed by both parties.
- **Obligation tracker:** verifies proof delivery on schedule (DP usage, erasure receipts, warrants used); flags breaches.
- **Dispute kit:** export evidence packet with neutral verifiers, counterexamples, and remediation paths.

### 5) Archival Integrity & PQC (v1)
- **Re‑seal archives:** re‑hash + re‑sign long‑term archives with hybrid signatures; store chain‑of‑sig proofs.
- **Time‑stamping:** append PQC‑anchored time‑stamps (RFC‑3161‑like) to critical artifacts; cross‑anchor on multiple authorities.
- **Fixity monitors:** rolling checks with repair playbooks; anomaly alerts.

### 6) UX, Ops, and Training
- **Crypto posture console:** shows tenant crypto profile, migration status, incompatible partners, next actions.
- **Safe‑mode runbook & drills:** tabletop + automated drills with scoring.
- **Diplomacy console:** visualize treaty graph, obligations due, breaches, and remediation status.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **PQC**
   - Hybrid signatures applied to new Assurance Bundles and disclosures; verifier accepts both stacks; migration wizard completes on demo tenant with attested log.
2. **Global Assurance**
   - Public verifier node validates bundles and freshness; revocation of a key is observed by SDK within minutes; transparency feed publishes counters for an opted‑in tenant.
3. **Safe Mode**
   - Simulated crisis triggers activate containment; write freeze and notify‑only actions enforced; return‑to‑service checklist restores normal ops.
4. **Knowledge Diplomacy**
   - A treaty is authored, signed, and enforced; obligation tracker flags a breach (late DP report) and issues a dispute export; remediation clears status.
5. **Archival Integrity**
   - Re‑sealed archive verifies with chain‑of‑sig proof; PQC time‑stamps validate across two authorities; fixity monitor detects and repairs a seeded error.
6. **UX/Ops**
   - Crypto console shows accurate posture; safe‑mode drill passes; diplomacy console reflects live obligations and breaches.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 16)
- ACs pass on multi‑tenant staging + one partner; security/compliance sign‑off on PQC and Safe Mode scopes; docs updated (PQC guide, Assurance Network, Safe‑mode SOP, Diplomacy handbook, Archival re‑seal); demo succeeds end‑to‑end.

---
## Demo Script
1. Export with **hybrid‑signed** Assurance Bundle; public verifier node validates; transparency feed shows counters.
2. Trigger **Safe Mode** by simulating data‑poison storm; writes freeze; automation downgrades; return‑to‑service workflow executed.
3. Author a **treaty** with a partner; an obligation breaches; dispute kit exported and resolved.
4. **Archive re‑seal** completes; time‑stamps verify from two authorities; fixity monitor repairs a seeded issue.
5. Crypto posture console shows migration status and partner compatibility warnings.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** PQC architecture, assurance network.
- **Backend (2):** hybrid signatures, revocation/freshness endpoints, treaty/obligation services.
- **Frontend (2):** crypto/diplomacy consoles, safe‑mode banners/workflows.
- **Platform (1):** drills, transparency feed, archival re‑sealing pipeline.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** treaty templates, PQC policy, safe‑mode approvals.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **PQC perf/size** → hybrid transitional mode; cache proofs; batch re‑signing for archives.
- **Verifier trust** → stateless, read‑only nodes; signed binaries; publish hashes.
- **Safe‑mode false positives** → strict triggers; manual override; clear banners.
- **Diplomatic disputes** → clear SLAs; neutral verifiers; remediation paths.

---
## Metrics
- PQC: ≥ 99% verification success on hybrid bundles; migration MTTR within target.
- Assurance network: revocation propagation < 5 min; transparency feed uptime ≥ 99.9%.
- Safe mode: activation MTTA < 60s; zero write mutations during containment.
- Diplomacy: 0 unresolved breaches beyond SLA; dispute resolution median time within target.
- Archives: 100% re‑sealed artifacts verified; fixity failures auto‑repaired.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **PQ‑KEM data sealing** for vaults.
- **Partner‑run verifier nodes** with attested binaries.
- **Safe‑mode auto‑tuning** based on incident class.

*Closing:* “Rotate your keys before your enemies rotate your luck.”
