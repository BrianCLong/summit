# 🗡️ Council of Spies & Strategists — Sprint 15 Plan (Q1 2029)

> Opening: “Assure the system, enlighten the model, anchor truth in hardware, and let the ecosystem run.”

## Sprint Goal (14–21 days)
Ship **Assurance GA** (end‑to‑end verifiability for actions, exports, and federation), introduce **Neuro‑Symbolic Reasoning** for hypotheses and constraints, expand **Hardware‑rooted Provenance** from edge to ingest, and activate the **Ecosystem Flywheel** (marketplace monetization, partner certification, community pipelines).

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Assurance GA (v1)
- **End‑to‑end attestations:** unify manifest, audit, policy, DP/ZK proofs into a single **Assurance Bundle** attached to actions/exports/federation replies.
- **Verifier suite:** CLI/SDK/UI to verify bundles offline; includes dependency checks (policies, models, keys, versions).
- **Assurance SLOs:** verify success rate, proof freshness, mean verify time; red paths alert.

### 2) Neuro‑Symbolic Reasoning (v1)
- **Constraint‑aware copilot:** combines LLM planning with symbolic constraints (policies, schema, time bounds) to generate explainable plans.
- **Reasoning traces:** compact, human‑readable traces (claims → rules → evidence) linked to graph citations.
- **Counter‑evidence search:** automatic attempts to falsify current hypothesis; surfaced before actions.

### 3) Hardware‑Rooted Provenance (v1)
- **Capture attestation:** mobile/edge apps sign captures with device identity (TPM/TEE/SE) + sensor metadata; chained into evidence logs.
- **Ingress validation:** server verifies device attestations, time window, and geo constraints; rejects stale or spoofed sources.
- **Key lifecycle:** device key provisioning, rotation, and remote revoke flows with audit evidence.

### 4) Ecosystem Flywheel (v1)
- **Partner certification:** signed tests for connectors/runbooks; compatibility badges; continuous contract checks.
- **Marketplace monetization:** paid listings (internal/partner) with DP budget pricing; settlement reports.
- **Community pipelines:** curated, signed community ETL/pattern packages; trust tiers; abuse reporting.

### 5) Analyst Experience — Insight Loops (v1)
- **Hypothesis replay:** one‑click re‑run of past cases on fresh data with diffed outcomes and cost reports.
- **Evidence notebook cells:** inline cells within cases (read‑only) to run safe NL→Cypher or motif snippets with citations.
- **Learning prompts:** nudge to add lessons‑learned or runbook updates when patterns repeat.

### 6) Operability & Governance (v4)
- **Assurance monitors:** fleetwide view of proof coverage, failures, and stale policies/models.
- **License governance:** track third‑party license terms across evidence and models; block incompatible exports.
- **Budget annealing:** adaptive budget policies that loosen/tighten per tenant based on historical efficiency.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Assurance GA**
   - Actions/exports/federation replies carry a single Assurance Bundle; offline verifier validates manifest + policies + proofs on demo data.
   - Verify success rate ≥ 99% on staging; proof freshness within configured windows.
2. **Neuro‑Symbolic**
   - Plans respect symbolic constraints; reasoning traces cite rules/evidence; counter‑evidence surfaced in ≥ 80% of test scenarios.
3. **Hardware Provenance**
   - Edge captures include device attestations; server validation rejects stale/spoofed submissions; revoke prevents further capture.
4. **Ecosystem**
   - At least 3 partner assets certified; paid listing flow operational; settlement stub reports generated.
5. **Analyst Loops**
   - Hypothesis replay produces diffs & costs; notebook cells run safely without live mutations; lessons‑learned prompts captured.
6. **Operability/Gov**
   - Assurance monitors green; license conflicts blocked with explanations; budget annealing reduces top‑decile query cost by ≥ 15%.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 15)
- All ACs pass on multi‑tenant staging and one partner; security/ombuds review; docs updated (Assurance spec, neuro‑symbolic guide, device provenance SOPs, partner certification, license governance); demo succeeds end‑to‑end.

---
## Demo Script
1. Analyst executes a policy‑bound action; the resulting **Assurance Bundle** is verified offline by a partner.
2. Copilot proposes a **constraint‑aware plan** with reasoning trace; counter‑evidence is found and alters the hypothesis before action.
3. Field device captures signed evidence; server validates; later the device is **revoked** and capture attempts fail with audited reasons.
4. A partner **certified connector** publishes a paid pattern; settlement report generated; community pipeline is installed with trust tier checks.
5. Past case **replay** highlights changed outcomes and costs; notebook cell runs a motif snippet; a lessons‑learned entry is prompted and saved.
6. **Assurance dashboard** shows full coverage; a license conflict blocks an export with a clear explanation; budget annealing reduces high‑cost queries.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** assurance/bundle architecture.
- **Backend (2):** verifier, hardware provenance, pricing/settlement.
- **Frontend (2):** traces, notebook cells, dashboards, marketplace.
- **Platform (1):** monitors, keys, budget annealing.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** policy constraints, license governance, partner certs.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Bundle bloat** → layered bundle with lazy fetch of heavy proof artifacts; caching; size budgets.
- **Reasoning trust** → traces + constraints; counter‑evidence by default; human approval.
- **Device spoofing** → hardware attestation + geo/time windows; rapid revoke.
- **Market abuse** → certification tests, trust tiers, abuse reporting.

---
## Metrics
- Assurance: ≥ 99% verification rate; median verify time within target.
- Reasoning: ≥ 70% analyst satisfaction with plan clarity; ≥ 80% tests with counter‑evidence surfaced.
- Hardware: 0 accepted spoofed captures in tests; revoke MTTR ≤ 10 min.
- Ecosystem: ≥ 5 monetized assets; partner NPS ≥ target.
- Insight loops: ≥ 30% cases replayed; cost reduction in top decile ≥ 15%.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **Composable multi‑proof bundles** (SNARK + DP + policy certs).
- **Symbolic abductive reasoning** for missing‑evidence suggestions.
- **Hardware attestation chains** displayed in public verifier for non‑sensitive fields.

*Closing:* “Assure, explain, attest — and let the ecosystem accelerate the craft.”
