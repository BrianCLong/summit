# ✈️ Total Air Superiority — Sprint 8 (Day 99–112)

**Start:** 2026‑01‑08  
**Duration:** 14 days  
**Prime Directive:** Expand dominance: predictive governance, sovereign analytics, turn‑key partner onboarding, and forensic time‑travel. No duplication of S1–S7.

---
## Non‑Dup Boundary (inherits S1–S7)
Off‑limits to re‑implement: prov/attestation + verifier SDKs, authority lifecycle + formal proofs, ER‑XAI v4, Disclosure Bundler + reply/e‑file, GraphRAG + caches + Planner 3.2, FinOps/billing/entitlements + revenue v2, streaming/CDC + 200k/min ingest, offline kits + DR + multi‑region A/A, chaos/fuzzing v2, SOC‑lite + auditor UX, partner adapters, tenant scale‑out, brief factory, auditor auto‑packs, ZTDP, i18n, compliance automation, self‑serve growth, sovereign/no‑egress, WORM.

---
## Sprint Objectives
1) **Predictive Governance:** detect policy drift *before* it bites; simulate impact and propose fixes.  
2) **Sovereign Analytics:** DP/k‑anon aggregates with per‑tenant privacy budgets and query attestations.  
3) **Partner Autopilot:** one‑day adapter bring‑up with license proofs and contract tests.  
4) **Forensic Time‑Machine:** point‑in‑time graph views with replayable queries and receipts.  
5) **Relentless Perf:** sub‑600ms copilot median; −10% infra $/case without SLO pain.

## Workstreams

### S8‑A — Predictive Governance (PGov v1)
**Lead:** @policy‑czar • **Areas:** `governance/`, `opa/`, `analytics/`, `alerts/`
- [ ] Policy telemetry model: features from deny/allow diffs, operator overrides, appeal outcomes.  
- [ ] **Drift forecaster** (rules + simple model) predicts breach risk by tenant/connector.  
- [ ] Auto‑PR generator proposes policy patches with simulator diffs + human‑readable rationales.  
- **DoD:** 3 historical breaches would have been flagged ≥7d earlier; two auto‑PRs merged after human review.

### S8‑B — Sovereign Analytics v2 (Budgets + Attestations)
**Lead:** @ops‑audit • **Areas:** `analytics/`, `governance/`, `prov-ledger/`
- [ ] Per‑analyst **privacy budget meters** (ε and k) with alerts + cooling periods.  
- [ ] Query attestation receipts: budget consumption, policy slice, timestamp, tenant.  
- [ ] Auditor roll‑ups by case/period; export to disclosure packs.  
- **DoD:** Budgets enforced with humane errors; receipts resolvable in ledger; auditor rebuilds monthly stats from receipts alone.

### S8‑C — Partner Autopilot (Adapters in a Day)
**Lead:** @ingest‑warden • **Areas:** `connectors/`, `contracts/`, `ci/`, `docs/`
- [ ] **Scaffold CLI**: `adapter init` generates mapping, license manifest, rate limits, tests, fixtures.  
- [ ] Contract test suite (license/TOS/throughput) that gates PRs.  
- [ ] Cookbook + example adapters; publishable badges ("License‑Safe", "Deterministic Replay").  
- **DoD:** Two net‑new adapters built from scaffold in <8h each; badges issued; throughput & license tests pass.

### S8‑D — Forensic Time‑Machine (PiT Graph)
**Lead:** @rag‑marshal • **Areas:** `graph-service/`, `storage/`, `cache/`, `apps/web/`
- [ ] **Point‑in‑time reads** via versioned edges/nodes + TTL‑aware caches.  
- [ ] Query replay harness with signature and diff vs. current state.  
- [ ] UI: PiT slider + "explain changes" panel with provenance hops.  
- **DoD:** Reproduce any case snapshot within 90 days; queries replay with identical results; receipts logged.

### S8‑E — Copilot & Planner Ruthlessness (v3.3)
**Lead:** @rag‑marshal • **Areas:** `copilot/`, `graph-service/`, `cache/`
- [ ] Early‑exit answerability classifier; skip hopeless queries with evidence‑first fallback.  
- [ ] Materialize high‑value subgraphs behind plan caps; invalidation via evidence timestamps + policy changes.  
- [ ] **Citation compactors** to keep answers short without losing evidence.  
- **DoD:** Copilot p50 <600ms, p95 <1.0s on eval; 0 broken citations; p95 graph read −12% vs S7.

### S8‑F — Blue/Green Multi‑Tenant Releases
**Lead:** @sre‑hawk • **Areas:** `deploy/`, `gateway/`, `RUNBOOKS/`
- [ ] Blue/green per tenant with traffic shadow + rollback receipts.  
- [ ] Canary scorecards (latency, error budget burn, policy denies).  
- [ ] Tenant‑scoped feature flag orchestration with audit trails.  
- **DoD:** 4 tenants upgraded with zero downtime; one forced rollback executed cleanly with receipts.

### S8‑G — WORM+ (Selective Reveal & Escrow)
**Lead:** @prov‑capt • **Areas:** `prov-ledger/`, `storage/`, `governance/`
- [ ] Selective‑reveal receipts (prove possession without content leak).  
- [ ] Dual‑key escrow workflow with ombuds approval and expiry.  
- [ ] Legal hold visualization in UI.  
- **DoD:** Two selective‑reveal proofs verified by third‑party tool; escrow events audited; UI shows holds clearly.

### S8‑H — Growth & NRR Engine
**Lead:** @finops • **Areas:** `billing/`, `apps/web/`, `analytics/`
- [ ] In‑app ROI stories tied to **saved analyst hours** and disclosure velocity.  
- [ ] Plan upgrade nudges based on usage deltas; A/B and holdouts.  
- [ ] NRR dashboard (expansion, contraction, churn) with drilldowns.  
- **DoD:** 10% plan upgrades in pilot cohort; NRR board live with weekly digest.

### S8‑I — DevEx Gauntlet v3
**Lead:** @devrel • **Areas:** `ci/`, `examples/`, `sdks/`
- [ ] Golden casepacks gain PiT fixtures + sovereign/offline variants.  
- [ ] CI "gauntlet" lane runs fuzzing seeds, policy proofs, privacy budget sims, and PiT replays.  
- [ ] One‑command **demo batteries** for SEs.  
- **DoD:** Gauntlet blocks bad merges; demo battery <12 min p90; docs auto‑publish.

## Cross‑Cut Deliverables
- **T1. Governance Forecast Pack:** drift models, top risky tenants/connectors, recommended patches with simulator diffs.  
- **T2. Sovereign Analytics Binder:** receipts + budgets + monthly auditor export.  
- **T3. Adapter Factory:** scaffold CLI, badges, and two reference adapters.  
- **T4. Forensic Replay Kit:** PiT slider, replay harness, and verification scripts.  
- **T5. Performance Board v4:** copilot/graph deltas, cache hit, failed‑citation rate (should be 0).  
- **T6. NRR Board:** upgrades, expansions, churn radar.

---
## Schedule & Cadence
- **D99–D101:** PGov telemetry + models; PiT storage/versioning design; adapter scaffold CLI; blue/green scaffolding.  
- **D102–D106:** Drift forecaster + auto‑PRs; PiT reads + replay; copilot v3.3; WORM+ selective reveal.  
- **D107–D110:** Sovereign analytics receipts; partner adapters from scaffold; blue/green upgrades; NRR/ROI features.  
- **D111–D112:** Hardening; docs; evidence packs; demo with receipts and PiT replay.

---
## Acceptance Gates (Exit)
- ✅ Drift forecaster flags ≥2 real risks with successful auto‑PR patches.  
- ✅ PiT graph reproduces snapshots ≤90 days; replay verifies; receipts recorded.  
- ✅ Copilot p50 <600ms / p95 <1.0s; 0 broken citations; p95 graph read −12% vs S7.  
- ✅ Two new adapters built in <8h with badges; contract tests pass.  
- ✅ Privacy budgets enforced with receipts; monthly sovereign analytics export reproducible.  
- ✅ 4 tenants upgraded via blue/green; one clean rollback with receipts.  
- ✅ NRR board live; ≥10% upgrade lift in pilot.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Drift model false alarms** → human‑reviewed patches + conservative thresholds.  
- **PiT storage cost** → tiering + pruning + 90‑day window.  
- **Selective‑reveal misuse** → ombuds dual‑control + expiry + audit.  
- **Adapter quality variance** → scaffold tests + badges + contract gates.  
- **Upgrade blast radius** → tenant‑scoped blue/green + precise rollbacks.

**Own the skies: predict, prevent, prove — and make it faster.**
