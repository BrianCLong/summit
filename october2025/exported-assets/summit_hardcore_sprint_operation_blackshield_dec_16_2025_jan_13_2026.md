# [MODE: WHITE+BLUE+PURPLE+GOLD] Summit — **Hardcore Sprint** (Operation **BLACKSHIELD**) — Dec 16, 2025 → Jan 13, 2026

**Classification:** Internal // Need-to-Know  
**Mission:** Execute a **no-excuses, production-grade hardening push** that pressure-tests and fortifies the entire stack against chained TTPs, ransomware-class scenarios, and supply-chain abuse — *without duplicating* Sprints #1–#2 or IRONCLAD. We extend only, we break glass only with audit, we ship proofs.

> **Guardrails:** No real exploitation, no customer data. Synthetic-only PURPLE, lawful OSINT only. Extend existing paths: `controls/opa/`, `alerting/`, `analytics/`, `RUNBOOKS/`, `.evidence/`, `tools/`, `audit/`, `sbom/`, `PURPLE/`.

---

## A) Executive Summary (Decisions & Next Steps)
- **Identity Kill‑Switch & Device Posture**: Enforce phishing-resistant MFA + device trust for all privileged actions, with auditable break-glass.
- **Auto‑Containment**: SOAR-lite workflows to disable tokens/keys, quarantine builds, and freeze risky deployments within 60s.
- **Ransomware & Immutable Recovery**: Tier-1 data vaulted with WORM retention; prove restore ≤ 2h; drill twice.
- **Supply‑Chain to SLSA L3+**: Reproducible builds, provenance attestations, and dependency quarantine on anomaly.
- **Chained PURPLE Campaigns**: Three end-to-end synthetic attacks executed under escort; fix gaps same-sprint.

---

## B) Objectives & Hardcore Exit Criteria
- **O1 Identity:** 100% admin WebAuthn; device posture required for prod actions; JIT elevation ≤ 90m; 100% break‑glass audited.
- **O2 Auto‑Containment:** Token disable, build quarantine, and deploy freeze **within 60s P95** of detection; documented rollbacks.
- **O3 Recovery:** Immutable backups for T1; **Restore ≤ 2h**, **RPO ≤ 10m**; 2 successful drills with evidence.
- **O4 Supply‑Chain:** SLSA L3 evidence for all T1 builds; in-toto attestations attached to releases; SBOM drift gates enforced.
- **O5 PURPLE:** 3 chained campaigns with **declare ≤ 10m**, **contain ≤ 60m**; coverage heatmap ≥ 95% relevant sub-techniques.

---

## C) Workstreams (Extend-Only, No Duplication)
### WS1 — Identity Kill‑Switch & Device Trust (Days 1–7)
- **W1.1 Device Posture Gate:** Extend `controls/opa/abac.rego` to require compliant device signals for `prod:*` actions (fields: `webauthn=true`, `device_trust=true`, `geo in {US,EU}`, `ticket`, `owner`).
- **W1.2 Break‑Glass 2.0:** `RUNBOOKS/break-glass.md` → add *timeboxed* access (≤30m), auto-revoke, and `.evidence/identity/break-glass/` manifest.
- **W1.3 Admin Surface Audit:** Script in `tools/identity/audit-admin-surface` to list admin endpoints, tokens, and stale roles; auto‑PR revocations.
- **DoD:** All privileged paths enforced; break‑glass uses WebAuthn + manager sign‑off; audit trail present.

### WS2 — SOAR‑Lite Auto‑Containment (Days 2–10)
- **W2.1 Actions Pipeline:** `tools/soar/` with workflows: `disable-token`, `quarantine-build`, `freeze-deploy`, `rotate-key` (idempotent; dry-run mode).
- **W2.2 Detection Hooks:** Extend `alerting/handlers/` to call SOAR actions on high-sev Sigma hits; add rollback play in each runbook.
- **W2.3 Safety & Tests:** Contract tests in `tools/soar/tests/` with synthetic events; CI must pass to merge.
- **DoD:** P95 auto‑containment ≤60s from alert create to action completion; dry‑run + prod toggles; rollback verified.

### WS3 — Ransomware-Class Resilience (Days 3–12)
- **W3.1 Immutable Vaulting:** `RUNBOOKS/backup-vault.md` + IaC snippets to enable WORM on T1 backups; retention & legal hold documented.
- **W3.2 3‑2‑1‑1‑0 Proofs:** Evidence checklist in `.evidence/recovery/` for copies, media, offsite+offline, immutability, and verified restores (0 errors).
- **W3.3 Dual Drills:** Two restores (hot + cold path) timed and hashed; publish `analytics/dashboards/recovery.json`.
- **DoD:** Both restores succeed; timings within targets; exec comms template filled.

### WS4 — Supply‑Chain: SLSA L3+ & Provenance (Days 4–12)
- **W4.1 Reproducible Builds:** Deterministic flags in CI; verify binary/source hash parity; store proofs in `.evidence/builds/`.
- **W4.2 in‑toto Attestations:** Add `audit/attestations/in-toto/*.jsonl` generated at build; verify on deploy.
- **W4.3 Dependency Quarantine:** On typosquat or license risk, auto‑PR to quarantine deps; gate deploy via OPA (`controls/opa/deps.rego`).
- **DoD:** Releases blocked without provenance; quarantine path tested; exceptions time‑bound.

### WS5 — PURPLE: Chained Campaigns (Days 6–18)
- **W5.1 Campaigns:** `PURPLE/campaigns/` plans for: (a) CI OIDC misbinding → secret exfil → artifact abuse; (b) rogue admin → policy bypass → data pull; (c) token theft → lateral IAM → egress burst.
- **W5.2 Telemetry Saturation:** Generate high‑volume synthetic noise during campaigns to test detection stability and cost controls.
- **W5.3 PAR + Fix Loop:** Turn findings into Issues/PRs same day; update rules, OPA gates, and runbooks.
- **DoD:** 3 PARs, gaps closed, metrics met.

### WS6 — Data Egress Broker & DLP‑Lite v2 (Days 7–16)
- **W6.1 Egress Broker Policy:** OPA policy `controls/opa/egress.rego` denies unsanctioned sinks; allow via ticketed exceptions.
- **W6.2 DLP‑Lite v2:** Expand pre‑commit/CI checks for PII/secrets across pipelines; tuned suppressions with expiry.
- **DoD:** Violations blocked; exceptions logged; FP < target.

### WS7 — Executive War‑Room Readiness (Days 10–18)
- **W7.1 Comms & Status Pages:** `comms/templates/war-room.md`; add incident status page mock with roles & cadence.
- **W7.2 Drill:** 60‑minute exec tabletop using Campaign (a); include legal/privacy flows.
- **DoD:** War‑room muscle memory demonstrated; comms artifacts signed.

## F) Risks & Mitigations
- **Over‑blocking gates** → Provide monitored break‑glass with expiry & auto‑revoke; require evidence.  
- **SOAR misfires** → Idempotent actions; dry‑run toggle; explicit scopes.  
- **Cost spikes** → Budget alerts & sampling; purge non‑critical fields.  
- **Restore drift** → Monthly checksum verification; alert on mismatch.

- **A:** Security Lead  
- **R:** IAM, SRE, AppSec, Detection Eng, IR, CTI  
- **C:** Legal, Privacy, Comms, Product  
- **I:** Exec Sponsor, Support

---

## H) Metrics (Exit)
- **Kill‑Switch:** 100% privileged actions require device trust; break‑glass audited 100%  
- **Auto‑Containment:** ≤60s P95 action latency; rollback verified  
- **Recovery:** RTO ≤2h; RPO ≤10m; 2 drills passed  
- **Supply‑Chain:** All T1 builds with in‑toto attestations; SLSA L3 met  
- **PURPLE:** 3 PARs; coverage ≥95% relevant sub‑techniques; declare/contain SLAs met

---

## I) Proof-Carrying Analysis (PCA)
**Assumptions:** IRONCLAD shipped telemetry schema v2, Sigma v3 lifecycle, release attestations, and WebAuthn/JIT elevation baselines. We extend those controls only.  
**Evidence:** CI policy diffs, synthetic event logs, restore drill outputs, in‑toto and SBOM artifacts, OPA test results.  
**Caveats:** Device trust signals depend on chosen IdP/MDM; define minimal claim set.  
**Verification:** CI blocks on missing attestations, SOAR tests failing, OPA gates bypassed, restores not run, or device trust absent on privileged actions.

**B‑E Aggressive — push to the limits, with proofs.**
