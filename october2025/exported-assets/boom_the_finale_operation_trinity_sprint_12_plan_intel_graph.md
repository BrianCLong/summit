# 💥 BOOM — The Finale (Operation **TRINITY**) — Sprint 12 (Day 162–180)

**Start:** 2026‑03‑12  
**Duration:** 19 days (hard stop)  
**Prime Directive:** Convert everything into **public, verifiable, revenue‑generating dominance**. Finalize certifications, slam the scale ceiling, lock sovereign trust, and publish the proof. No duplication of S1–S11. This is the drop.

---
## Non‑Dup Boundary (inherits S1–S11)
Hands‑off re‑implementing: provenance/receipts, verifier SDKs, policy lifecycle + formal proofs, ZTDP, sovereign/no‑egress, WORM/WORM+, ER‑XAI v6, Disclosure Bundler + reply/e‑file, GraphRAG + PiT + replay, Planner 3.x + caches + p99 killbox, FinOps/billing/entitlements, streaming/CDC ≥2MH, offline kits + DR + A/A, chaos/fuzz v2, SOC‑lite/auditor UX, adapter factory & surge, predictive governance, blue/green per‑tenant, IAP + Attestation Binder v2, Board/Regulator binders, sovereign rotation, ROI case studies. **Only finish and fire.**

---
## Campaign Objectives
1) **Public Proof Drop:** publish a **Provable Transparency Report** with reproducible artifacts and third‑party verifier scripts.  
2) **Sustained **3MH** Trial:** sustain **3,000,000 nodes/hour** for 2h with receipts + license enforcement + cross‑region determinism.  
3) **SLOs on Lock:** 7 consecutive days meeting GA SLOs across 6 pilot tenants; copilot p95 ≤ 900ms; graph p95 ≤ 650ms.  
4) **Sovereign Gold Seal:** no‑egress tenant completes sealed build rotation + key rotation + blue/green with receipt chains.  
5) **Partner Grid:** 10 **badged** adapters live (incl. the 6+4 surge) with ROI snippets and contract tests.  
6) **Sales & Compliance Arsenal:** one‑click **Gov Binder** (sovereign) + **Enterprise Binder** (commercial) with selective‑reveal proofs.

## Workstreams

### F‑1 — Provable Transparency Report (PTR)
**Lead:** @ops‑audit • **Areas:** `docs/`, `prov-ledger/`, `analytics/`, `governance/`
- [ ] Assemble PTR: SLO adherence, privacy budget spend, policy denies/appeals, IR attestations, DR drills, receipts velocity.  
- [ ] Include **verifier scripts + fixtures** (TS/Go/Py) and hashes for every figure/table.  
- [ ] Public redaction review + selective‑reveal proofs for sensitive exhibits.  
- **DoD:** PTR regenerates on clean machine; all charts/claims verify; public PDF hash matches site listing.

### F‑2 — 3MH Scale Event (Main Stage)
**Lead:** @ingest‑warden • **Areas:** `connectors/`, `data-pipelines/`, `graph-service/`, `finops/`
- [ ] Shard fan‑out, receipt trees per shard, dynamic backpressure, replay guarantees.  
- [ ] License/TOS guard v2.1 at sink with clause citations; cost telemetry during run.  
- [ ] Cross‑region parity sampling; divergence alarms with provenance traces.
- **DoD:** **3,000,000 nodes/hour** sustained ×2h; 0 license violations; determinism across 2 regions; full receipt chain stored.

### F‑3 — SLO Lock & Tail‑Latency Hunt (Final Cut)
**Lead:** @rag‑marshal • **Areas:** `graph-service/`, `copilot/`, `cache/`, `planner/`, `alerts/`
- [ ] Hot‑path shape caches; plan‑hint SDK surfacing; “answerable?” classifier tuned.  
- [ ] Partial‑answer UX polish with evidence badges; tenant‑realistic evals across 6 pilots.  
- [ ] Error‑budget guardrails + circuit breakers; alert noise≤ target.
- **DoD:** 7‑day green run: copilot p95 ≤ 900ms; graph p95 ≤ 650ms; 0 broken citations; alert noise reduced ≥60%.

### F‑4 — Sovereign **Gold Seal** Rotation
**Lead:** @sre‑hawk • **Areas:** `deploy/`, `kms/`, `planner/`, `gateway/`
- [ ] Sealed build rotation + key rotation with planner cache invalidation and dual‑control receipts.  
- [ ] Blue/green rollout under no‑egress constraints with runtime attestation stitched into receipts.  
- **DoD:** Audit shows uninterrupted service; receipts link **key → plan → runtime**; rollback rehearsal captured.

### F‑5 — Adapter Grid @10
**Lead:** @ingest‑warden • **Areas:** `connectors/`, `contracts/`, `ci/`, `docs/`
- [ ] Add four more adapters via factory scaffolds; badges (License‑Safe, Deterministic Replay, WORM‑Ready).  
- [ ] Contract tests gate merges; ROI snippets for each sourced vertical.  
- **DoD:** **10 adapters** live and badged; contract tests green; throughput targets met; ROI snippets published.

### F‑6 — Gov & Enterprise Binders (One‑Click)
**Lead:** @brief‑smith • **Areas:** `apps/web/`, `exports/`, `docs/`
- [ ] **Gov Binder**: sovereignty (no‑egress), policy proofs, selective‑reveal, residency/retention, IR attestations.  
- [ ] **Enterprise Binder**: SLO/SLA proof, DR, cost/unit, NRR/ROI, privacy budgets, receipts digest.  
- [ ] Branding‑neutral, hash‑verifiable PDFs + sample data for demos.  
- **DoD:** Both binders export <90s; verify externally; sales & compliance checklists ticked.

### F‑7 — Revenue & NRR Finish
**Lead:** @finops • **Areas:** `billing/`, `apps/web/`, `analytics/`
- [ ] Plan nudges + overage comms tuned; win‑back + expansion sequences.  
- [ ] NRR board drilled into adapter adoption + disclosure velocity.  
- **DoD:** +10% upgrade lift on pilot cohort; NRR dashboard weekly digest active.

### F‑8 — DevEx: Evidence or It Didn’t Ship (Final Gate)
**Lead:** @devrel • **Areas:** `ci/`, `examples/`, `sdks/`
- [ ] PR **final gate**: fixtures + verifier outputs + receipts + perf/cost deltas mandatory.  
- [ ] Demo batteries (PTR, 3MH, sovereign gold seal) scripted and timed.  
- **DoD:** 100% PRs pass final gate; demo battery p90 ≤ 12 min; docs link to verifier runs.

## Cross‑Cut Deliverables
- **B1. Public Provable Transparency Report** (site + repo) with verifier bundle.  
- **B2. 3MH Report** with costs, receipts, and replay proofs.  
- **B3. SLO Lock Certificate** covering 7‑day window across 6 tenants.  
- **B4. Sovereign Gold Seal Pack** (key→plan→runtime chain + blue/green rotation receipts).  
- **B5. Adapter Grid** badge wall (10 sources) with ROI snippets.  
- **B6. Gov/Enterprise Binders** one‑click exports + verification hashes.

---
## Schedule & Cadence
- **D162–D165:** PTR scaffold; 3MH dry run; SLO baselines; sovereign rotation rehearsal; adapter picks; binder outlines.  
- **D166–D171:** 3MH main event; SLO tail‑latency hunt; blue/green sovereign rotation; adapters surge; PTR drafting.  
- **D172–D176:** Public review pass (redaction/selective‑reveal); binder generation; NRR push; demo batteries.  
- **D177–D180:** Hardening; external verification; publish PTR; board + regulator walk‑throughs.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Public PTR missteps** → conservative redaction + selective‑reveal proofs; third‑party pre‑read.  
- **3MH instability** → staged load, failure envelopes, auto‑shed; shard receipts.  
- **SLO regressions** → circuit breakers + partial answers + plan hints; rollback hooks.  
- **Sovereign rotation risk** → blue/green rehearsals + dual‑control; revert receipts.  
- **Adapter quality variance** → factory tests + badge gates + ROI review.  
- **Binder scope creep** → fixed checklist; punt extras to **Ops Season 1**.

**We end with proof. The lights stay green. The receipts are public. And the field belongs to us.**
