# üó°Ô∏è Council of Spies & Strategists ‚Äî Sprint Plan (Q4¬†2025)

> Ceremonial Opening: ‚ÄúLet shadows convene and voices of cunning speak. The chamber is in session.‚Äù

## Sprint Goal (14 days)
Deliver a **vertical, auditable slice** from **Ingest ‚Üí Resolve ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Query ‚Üí Report**, gated by **ABAC/OPA** and **immutable audit**, with a first pass of the **Provenance & Claim Ledger**. Outcome: an analyst ingests a CSV, maps to canonical entities, resolves duplicates, explores the subgraph in the tri‚Äëpane UI, asks a natural‚Äëlanguage question (read‚Äëonly), and exports a **disclosure bundle** with a verifiable manifest.

---
## Why These Priorities (Signals from the Council)
- **Core GA slice** is explicitly called for near‚Äëterm: ingest/graph/analytics/copilot + ABAC/OPA + audit + tri‚Äëpane UI + ‚â•10 connectors.
- **Provenance > prediction** and **oversight by design** are bedrock principles. The ledger and audit must ship with the slice.
- **Operate degraded** and **observability** start this sprint (dashboards + cost guards skeletons); deeper offline kit in a follow‚Äëup.

---
## Scope & Deliverables
### 1) Data Intake & ETL Assistant (MVP)
- **Connectors (v0):** CSV upload + S3 bucket pull.
- **Ingest Wizard:** schema mapping UI with AI suggestions, field validation, PII flags, license/source capture.
- **Streaming ETL:** enrichment stubs (hash, language), EXIF strip on images (if present), OCR stub wired behind a flag.
- **Done =** mapped entities land in canonical model with lineage recorded.

### 2) Canonical Graph Core (v0.9)
- **Types:** Person, Org, Asset, Account, Location, Event, Document, Claim, Case.
- **Temporal fields:** observedAt/recordedAt + validFrom/validTo scaffolding.
- **Policy labels:** origin, sensitivity, legalBasis, purpose, retention.

### 3) Entity Resolution (ER) (MVP)
- **Deterministic blockers:** email/phone/account/document checksum; phonetic name key.
- **Explain panel:** feature deltas + human override; reversible merges.

### 4) Provenance & Claim Ledger (beta stub)
- **Evidence registration:** checksum, source, transform chain.
- **Claim nodes:** attach confidence + citations to edges/nodes.
- **Export manifest:** hash tree + transform chain (verifiable JSON).

### 5) AI Copilot (Read‚ÄëOnly NL‚ÜíCypher)
- **Prompt ‚Üí generated Cypher preview** with cost/row estimate; sandbox execution (read‚Äëonly) with rollback.
- **Guardrails:** show citation/warnings; block if policy labels disallow.

### 6) Analyst Experience (Tri‚ÄëPane v1)
- **Graph + Timeline + Map** synchronized brushing; pinboard save; provenance tooltips; confidence opacity.

### 7) Governance & Security (Foundations)
- **ABAC/OPA** enforcement on read paths; need‚Äëto‚Äëknow via policy labels.
- **Immutable audit**: who/what/why/when with reason‚Äëfor‚Äëaccess prompt.

### 8) Observability & Cost Guard (Foundations)
- **OTEL traces + Prom metrics** for ingest & query paths.
- **SLO dashboard (starter):** p95 graph query, ingest E2E, error rates.
- **Cost guard skeleton:** query cost estimate + budget fields (no hard enforcement yet).

### 9) Reporting & Disclosure (MVP)
- **Brief/Report studio:** export a SITREP with figures from graph snapshots only.
- **Disclosure packager:** bundle evidence + manifest + license terms.

---
## Acceptance Criteria (per workstream)
1. **Ingest Wizard**
   - Map a 5k‚Äërow CSV ‚Üí canonical in ‚â§10 minutes with AI suggestions; PII fields flagged; license recorded.
   - Lineage captured for every field; blocked fields show human‚Äëreadable policy reason.
2. **Graph Core**
   - Time‚Äëslice query returns consistent neighborhood snapshot; unknown types render safely.
3. **ER**
   - Deterministic merges reproducible on golden sample; **Explain** shows features & override log; merges reversible.
4. **Provenance & Ledger**
   - Export produces manifest (hash tree + transform chain) verifiable by the external verifier script.
5. **Copilot**
   - ‚â•95% syntactic validity on test prompts; query preview shows cost; undo/rollback works.
6. **Tri‚ÄëPane**
   - Analyst can brush time to filter graph + map; tooltips show provenance; save/load a view.
7. **ABAC/OPA + Audit**
   - Attempted access without legal basis ‚Üí denied with reason; all reads log who/what/why.
8. **Observability**
   - Dashboards live with p95 graph query, ingest latency, error rate; alert on SLO breach.
9. **Disclosure**
   - Generated brief includes CH/COI table slots, confidence bands, and citations; bundle passes verifier.

## Definition of Done (Sprint)
- All AC above pass; security review (STRIDE skim) with **zero criticals**; dashboards populated; demo scenario runs end‚Äëto‚Äëend with seeded dataset; docs updated (runbook + model cards + data contracts).

---
## Demo Script (End‚Äëto‚ÄëEnd)
1. Upload CSV (persons/orgs/relations); map fields; see PII and license flags.
2. Run ETL; open case; watch entities materialize with provenance tooltips.
3. ER panel: resolve duplicates; show Explain; undo a merge.
4. Ask: ‚ÄúShow paths between Org‚ÄëX and Account‚ÄëY in 2024.‚Äù Preview Cypher; run; inspect tri‚Äëpane.
5. Export **Disclosure Bundle**; open manifest; verify hash chain.

---
## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** architecture, OPA, ledger APIs.
- **Backend (2):** ingest, ER, manifest, metrics.
- **Frontend (2):** wizard, tri‚Äëpane, copilot UI.
- **Platform (1):** OTEL/Prom, SLO dashboards, CI.
- **PM/Design (1):** AC, demo script, docs.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** policy reasons, audit review.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope creep** in Copilot ‚Üí keep **read‚Äëonly**; no write mutations.
- **Policy complexity** ‚Üí start with read paths + minimal label set; simulate before expand.
- **ER quality** ‚Üí MVP deterministic only; defer probabilistic to next sprint; keep reversible.
- **Latency regressions** ‚Üí cost guard + budget estimator early; alert SLO breaches.

---
## Metrics for this Sprint
- TTFI for first insight from ingest < 15m.
- p95 3‚Äëhop query < 1.5s on seeded dataset.
- 100% of reads carry reason‚Äëfor‚Äëaccess; 100% export bundles verifiable.
- Demo pass rate: 100% on run‚Äëof‚Äëshow.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- Add **RSS** + **STIX/TAXII** connectors (read‚Äëonly) to hit 4 connectors.
- Offline Kit v0: local‚Äëonly tri‚Äëpane + signed sync logs.
- SLO alerts for cost spikes (query budgeter warn‚Äëonly).

---
## Next Sprint (preview)
- Probabilistic ER + adjudication queues.
- Pattern miner (co‚Äëpresence) + anomaly scoring.
- Runbook library (R11 Campaign Graph Builder; R16 High‚ÄëFidelity Alert Triage).
