# 🗡️ Exploit and Expand — Sprint 5 (Day 57–70)

**Start:** 2025‑11‑27  
**Duration:** 14 days  
**Prime Directive:** Scale revenue, crush latency, and weaponize proof. We **do not** rebuild Sprints 1–4; we compound them into ruthless execution across tenants, geos, and partners.

---
## Non‑Dup Boundary (inherits S1–S4)
Already shipped/in‑flight: provenance/attestation + verifier SDKs; authority lifecycle & OPA packs; ER‑XAI v3 + decay + golden tasks; Disclosure Bundler + reply/e‑file; GraphRAG with path rationales + caching; Query Planner v3 + hot‑path materialization; FinOps cost guards + planner hints; streaming/CDC connectors; field kits + DR; multi‑region A/A + isolation proofs; chaos GameDays; SOC‑lite + audit UX; partner adapters; GA SLOs; billing/entitlements; data residency/retention; release trains; marketplace readiness. This sprint is **expansion, optimization, monetization**.

---
## Sprint Objectives
1) **Tenant Scale‑Out:** add 4 tenants across two regions with isolation proofs and tuned budgets.  
2) **Sub‑Second Copilot:** hit <650ms median, <1.2s p95 on the standard GraphRAG eval.  
3) **Revenue Engine:** plan caps, usage metering v2, collections, churn radar.  
4) **Evidence Superiority:** turnkey “brief factory” and auditor pack automation.  
5) **Trust & Safety at Scale:** adaptive guardrails, cross‑tenant anomaly sensing.

## Workstreams

### WS‑I — Tenant Scale‑Out & Playbooks v2
**Lead:** @ops‑audit • **Areas:** `deploy/`, `RUNBOOKS/`, `gateway/`
- [ ] Region templates & IaC for fast tenant bring‑up (EU/US).  
- [ ] Isolation proofs: traffic shadowing + blast‑radius scripts per tenant.  
- [ ] Budget presets by plan (Essentials/Pro/Gov) with preflight checks.  
- **DoD:** 4 new tenants live; isolation tests pass; SLOs green 7d; rollback rehearsed once per tenant.

### WS‑II — Copilot Velocity Push (Sub‑Second)
**Lead:** @rag‑marshal • **Areas:** `graph-service/`, `copilot/`, `cache/`
- [ ] Query decomposition heuristics (early‑stop, top‑k path pruning).  
- [ ] Answer compaction pipeline (citation‑first, brevity scoring).  
- [ ] L2 cache for rationales (policy‑aware keys + invalidation).  
- **DoD:** Median <650ms, p95 <1.2s on eval; zero stale‑policy leaks; citations 100% resolvable.

### WS‑III — Revenue Engine v2 (Metering → Collections)
**Lead:** @finops • **Areas:** `billing/`, `finops/`, `gateway/`, `docs/`
- [ ] Usage signals expanded (edge syncs, disclosure packs, policy simulator hours).  
- [ ] Overages with grace windows + comms hooks; collections triggers.  
- [ ] Churn radar (14d usage slope, incident rate, NPS tie‑in).  
- **DoD:** Invoices w/ overage lines for 4 tenants; dunning flow demo; churn risk list auto‑generated.

### WS‑IV — Brief Factory & Auditor Auto‑Packs
**Lead:** @brief‑smith • **Areas:** `apps/web/`, `exports/`, `docs/`
- [ ] Case‑type templates → one‑click brief with exhibits, contradictions, right‑to‑reply thread.  
- [ ] Auditor Pack automation (policy hashes, privacy budget ledger, residency proofs).  
- [ ] Evidence delta view (since last filing) with signable addendum.  
- **DoD:** 3 case types export in <90s; external verifier passes; auditor reconstructs from pack alone.

### WS‑V — Guardrails at Scale (Abuse, PI, Selector Misuse)
**Lead:** @redteam • **Areas:** `copilot/`, `alerts/`, `analytics/`
- [ ] Cross‑tenant anomaly detection (prompt families, selector patterns).  
- [ ] Adaptive throttles + honeypot prompts; safe‑exfil patterns blocked.  
- [ ] Red‑team replay v3 with trend dashboard.  
- **DoD:** ≥90% attack scenarios detected; analyst false positives <5%; ombuds queue includes full context.

### WS‑VI — Connector Throughput & Replay Determinism v2
**Lead:** @ingest‑warden • **Areas:** `connectors/`, `data-pipelines/`, `storage/`
- [ ] High‑throughput CDC path (100k events/min staging) with backpressure.  
- [ ] Replay determinism across regions; provenance receipts per batch.  
- [ ] License/TOS enforcement at sink w/ human‑readable blockers.  
- **DoD:** 100k/min sustained; two region replays match; blocked exports show exact clause.

### WS‑VII — Cost/Perf Squeeze (Planner v3.1)
**Lead:** @sre‑hawk • **Areas:** `graph-service/`, `finops/`, `grafana/`
- [ ] Cardinality learning from prod telemetry; per‑pattern hints surfaced.  
- [ ] Heatmap of expensive paths; auto‑PR comments proposing indices/materializations.  
- [ ] Storage tiering polish (hot/warm/cold) + TTL audits.  
- **DoD:** p95 graph read −15% vs Sprint‑4; infra $/tenant −10% without SLO regressions.

### WS‑VIII — DevEx & CI/CD Auto‑Receipts
**Lead:** @devrel • **Areas:** `ci/`, `docs/`, `examples/`
- [ ] “Evidence or it didn’t happen” bot: enforces DoD artifacts (fixtures, scripts, screenshots).  
- [ ] Quickstart sandboxes hardened; SDK docs autogen from tests.  
- [ ] Release notes → signed receipts + permalinks to verifier output.  
- **DoD:** 100% merged PRs carry receipts; three new quickstarts pass CI; notes link to green verifications.

## Cross‑Cut Deliverables
- **X1. Tenant Launch Pack:** IaC templates, isolation scripts, budget presets, rollback scripts.  
- **X2. Copilot Eval Upgrade:** public eval pack with latency/citation dashboards.  
- **X3. Revenue Board v2:** MRR, ARPU, overage %, dunning pipeline, churn radar.  
- **X4. Compliance Binder v1.2:** automated auditor packs + privacy budgets + residency proofs.  
- **X5. Red‑Team Trendbook:** month‑over‑month attack patterns and mitigations.

---
## Schedule & Cadence
- **D57–D59:** Tenant templates, baseline perf, billing signals expansion.  
- **D60–D64:** Copilot speed push; connector throughput; guardrail anomalies.  
- **D65–D68:** Brief Factory + auditor packs; overage/dunning; replay determinism.  
- **D69–D70:** Hardening; launch 4 tenants; publish receipts; board review.

---
## Acceptance Gates (Exit)
- ✅ 4 tenants live with SLOs green 7 consecutive days.  
- ✅ Copilot median <650ms, p95 <1.2s with 100% valid citations.  
- ✅ Revenue: invoices incl. overages; dunning/collections live; churn radar populated.  
- ✅ Brief Factory exports 3 case types <90s; external verifier passes; auditor auto‑packs reconstruct a case.  
- ✅ Throughput 100k/min sustained; deterministic replays across two regions.  
- ✅ p95 graph read −15% vs Sprint‑4; infra cost −10%; CI receipts on 100% of merged PRs.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Sub‑second instability** → staged rollout, circuit‑breakers, fallback answers.  
- **Overage backlash** → humane comms + grace windows + transparent metering.  
- **Anomaly false positives** → per‑tenant baselines + analyst feedback loop.  
- **Connector backpressure** → queue sizing + shed non‑critical load.  
- **Audit fatigue** → automate packs; “one‑click receipts” in CI.

**Expand the footprint. Tighten the loop. Monetize the win — with receipts.**
