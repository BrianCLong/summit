# üó°Ô∏è Council of Spies & Strategists ‚Äî Sprint 21 Plan (Q3¬†2030)

> Opening: ‚ÄúTrust what you can prove, prove what you can trace, and retire what you cannot defend.‚Äù

## Sprint Goal (14‚Äì21 days)
Harden truth and operations with **Deepfake Forensics & Media Provenance**, a **Zero‚ÄëTrust Dataflow Compiler** that guarantees policy compliance at runtime, **LTS Sustainment** for long‚Äëhorizon stability, **Partner Certification GA**, and first‚Äëclass **Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIA)** embedded in workflows.

---
## Scope & Deliverables

### 1) Deepfake Forensics & Media Provenance (v1)
- **Detection ensemble:** CNN+transformer detectors for image/video/audio tampering; error‚Äëlevel/rPRNU/frequency artifacts; calibrated scores.
- **Watermarks & signatures:** read/verify **C2PA**/Content Credentials; generate signed provenance manifests for exports; fragile watermarking for internal pipeline.
- **Forensics studio:** compare originals vs. transforms; show heatmaps; attach findings to evidence nodes with confidence + caveats.

### 2) Zero‚ÄëTrust Dataflow Compiler (v1)
- **Policy‚Üíplan compiler:** compile queries, runbooks, and playbooks into **policy‚Äëaware execution plans** with static checks (label reachability, residency, warrant gates, budget caps).
- **Runtime enforcer:** inserts guards (row filters, DP gates, k‚Äëanon checks) and emits **explain‚Äëwhen‚Äëblocked** messages.
- **Proof artifacts:** each run emits a machine‚Äëreadable **dataflow proof** (sources, transforms, guards triggered) signed into the manifest.

### 3) LTS Sustainment & Sunsetting (v2)
- **LTS branch kit:** quarterly long‚Äëterm branches; backport pipeline; compatibility tests; CVE fast‚Äëpath.
- **Sunset orchestrator:** coordinated deprecations across connectors/models/runbooks with blast‚Äëradius previews and migration aids.
- **Sustainability KPIs:** track upgrade MTTR, backport velocity, and deprecation completion.

### 4) Partner Certification GA (v2)
- **Cert tracks:** connectors, runbooks, datasets; **signed conformance tests** and policy proofs; badge issuance and revocation.
- **Continuous compliance:** scheduled re‚Äëtests; drift alerts; remediation SLAs.
- **Marketplace gating:** certified assets prioritized; uncertified flagged with risks.

### 5) Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIA) (v1)
- **HRIA templates:** risk taxonomy (privacy, discrimination, due process, freedom of expression) with mitigations.
- **Workflow gates:** high‚Äërisk actions require HRIA acknowledgment and approvals; audit stores rationale and alternatives considered.
- **Public‚Äëfacing summary:** optional redacted HRIA summary attached to disclosures.

### 6) Operability, Training & SLOs (v7)
- **Forensics SLOs:** detector throughput/latency; false‚Äëpositive budget.
- **Compiler SLOs:** plan compile time, guard hit rates, proof generation success.
- **LTS SLOs:** backport turnaround, upgrade success; certification SLA dashboards; HRIA completion rates.
- **Training:** analyst course on media forensics; operator course on compiler plans and proofs.

---
## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Deepfake Forensics**
   - Forensics studio flags seeded tampering across image/video/audio; C2PA signatures verified on demo assets; exports embed signed provenance.
2. **ZT Dataflow Compiler**
   - Queries/runbooks compile into plans with guards; a seeded policy breach is blocked with clear explain‚Äëwhy; proof artifacts validate.
3. **LTS Sustainment**
   - LTS branch cut; one backport shipped; sunset orchestrator migrates a deprecated connector and a model with previews and rollbacks.
4. **Partner Cert GA**
   - ‚â• 5 partner assets certified; drift detection triggers re‚Äëtest; a failed asset has badge revoked and remediation tracked.
5. **HRIA**
   - A high‚Äërisk action requires HRIA approval; public‚Äëfacing summary attaches to a disclosure; audit shows mitigations and alternatives.
6. **SLOs/Training**
   - Forensics and compiler SLOs green; LTS/cert dashboards live; HRIA completion ‚â• target; training modules completed by pilot teams.

## Definition of Done (Sprint 21)
- ACs pass on staging + partner pilots; security/ombuds approve HRIA and compiler gates; docs updated (forensics guide, dataflow compiler spec, LTS/sunset manual, certification GA, HRIA policy); demo succeeds end‚Äëto‚Äëend.

---
## Demo Script
1. Ingest tampered media; **forensics** flags artifacts; C2PA verified; export includes signed provenance.
2. A complex runbook compiles; runtime guard blocks an out‚Äëof‚Äëresidency join; **explain‚Äëwhy** shown; dataflow proof verifies.
3. Cut an **LTS** branch; backport CVE fix; sunset orchestrator migrates a connector with preview and rollback.
4. Partner asset passes **cert**; later drift triggers re‚Äëtest ‚Üí badge revoked ‚Üí remediation ‚Üí badge restored.
5. High‚Äërisk action triggers **HRIA**; approvals captured; public summary attached to disclosure.

## Roles & Allocation (suggested)
- **Tech Lead (1):** compiler architecture, HRIA integration.
- **ML Eng (1):** forensics ensemble calibration.
- **Backend (2):** compiler, proofs, LTS/sunset, certification runtime.
- **Frontend (2):** forensics studio, compiler explains, cert dashboards, HRIA flows.
- **Platform (1):** SLOs, pipelines, training modules.
- **Security/Ombuds (0.5):** HRIA templates, cert policy, reviews.

---
## Risks & Mitigations
- **Forensics false positives** ‚Üí multi‚Äëmodel ensemble + calibration; human review; clear caveats.
- **Compiler regressions** ‚Üí CI tests on policies; staged rollouts; readable explains.
- **LTS overhead** ‚Üí automation + strict scope; backport criteria.
- **Partner friction** ‚Üí clear cert criteria, remediation support, marketplace incentives.
- **HRIA delays** ‚Üí templates + fast paths; scope thresholds.

---
## Metrics
- Forensics: target ROC on seeded set; < threshold false positives; provenance attach rate 100%.
- Compiler: plan compile p95 < target; guard hit rate tracked; 0 unaudited runs.
- LTS: upgrade success ‚â• 99%; backport MTTR ‚â§ target.
- Cert: ‚â• 90% certified assets stay in compliance; drift MTTA within target.
- HRIA: completion ‚â• target; public summaries attached where enabled.

---
## Stretch (pull if we run hot)
- **On‚Äëcapture watermarking** in Field Kit.
- **Typed dataflow language** for human‚Äëreadable plans.
- **Public cert directory** with verifier links.

*Closing:* ‚ÄúCompile the policy into the plan; make the media confess; keep the lineage alive for decades.‚Äù
