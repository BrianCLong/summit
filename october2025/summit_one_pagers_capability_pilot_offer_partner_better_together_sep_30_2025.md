- **Compliance‑by‑Design:** DLP/export gates, privacy modes, SBOM/SLSA supply‑chain, audit logs, BYOK/HSM‑ready.

## Differentiators
- **Analyst Velocity:** Tri‑pane investigation UX + NL→Cypher; task kits for DFIR/Fraud/Disinfo.  
- **Governed AI:** OPA decisions logged and explainable; plug‑ins signed/attested; evidence bundle export.  
- **Cost & Control:** Per‑tenant SLOs and budgets; micro‑canary and blue/green rollouts; observability end‑to‑end.  
- **Partner‑Ready:** API/SDK, connector kits, and “better together” architectures for primes/SIs.

## Target Missions / Use Cases
- **Defense/Intel:** OSINT/all‑source fusion, disinformation detection, threat network mapping, analyst workbenches.  
- **Civilian/Justice:** Fraud, waste & abuse; illicit finance; supply‑chain risk; case management acceleration.  
- **Critical Infra/FSI/Health:** Threat intel, fraud rings, vendor/third‑party risk, incident response.

## Readiness & Compliance
- **Security:** OPA/ABAC; DLP & privacy modes; audit trail & provenance ledger; secrets rotation; rate limiting.  
- **Supply‑Chain:** SBOM (SPDX/CycloneDX) for core services; Cosign‑verified plug‑ins; SLSA‑2 CI posture.  
- **Pathways:** CMMC mapping in progress; SOC2 mapping starter; FedRAMP path documented; DPIA templates ready.  
- **Data Handling:** ITAR/EAR screening support; data locality controls; redaction flows.

## Contracting & Vehicles (illustrative)
- **Fast Lanes:** OTAs via consortia, CSOs/BAAs, CRADAs, university labs, pilot MOUs.  
- **Through Primes:** Teaming on IDIQ/GWAC/SEWP‑type vehicles; task‑order capture support.  
- **NAICS/PSC (typical):** 541511/541512/541519/541690 (confirm per opportunity).

## Past Performance / References
- Available under NDA; sample evidence bundles (audit logs, SBOMs, policy decisions, perf tests) provided during security review.

# 2) Paid Pilot Offer — “Land → Prove → Expand” (1‑Pager)

**Objective:** Prove analyst velocity, governance, and deployability on your data within 6–12 weeks, with a clean on‑ramp to production.

## Scope & Success Criteria
- **Use‑Case Track:** Choose 1–2 (e.g., Disinfo, Fraud, DFIR).  
- **Success Definition (examples):**  
  - \>30% faster time‑to‑insight on benchmark tasks.  
  - \>85% task success via NL→Cypher on curated queries.  
  - Policy gates (OPA/ABAC, DLP/export) validated with zero critical findings.  
  - p95 API latency ≤ 300ms at pilot scale; availability ≥ 99.5%.

## Deliverables
- **Configured Pilot Stack:** Docker Compose full stack + seed data; secure connectors (STIX/TAXII, SIEM, OSINT/CSV).  
- **Analyst Workspace:** Tri‑pane Graph/Timeline/Map; task kits; saved cases; evidence export.  
- **Governance:** OPA policies, DLP gates, audit & provenance dashboards; sample Evidence Bundle v0.9.  
- **Report‑Out:** Metrics pack (latency, error, usage), task outcomes, ROI/TCO model, production rollout plan.

## Timeline (typical 8 weeks)
- **Wk 0–1:** Data & security intake; success plan; connector setup.  
- **Wk 2–3:** Pilot stack live; baseline measures; user training.  
- **Wk 4–6:** Iteration; policy validation; canary features.  
- **Wk 7–8:** Final eval; exec readout; production SOW & pricing.

## Pricing (fixed‑fee)
- **$75k–$150k** depending on scope, data volume, and security posture.  
- **Credit:** Up to **50%** applied to Year‑1 subscription with production commit.

## Customer Responsibilities
- Data access & test accounts; security review participation; pilot champions (exec + analyst).  
- Non‑PII sample data preferred for week‑1; DPIA/ROPA if PII involved.

## Exit to Production
- Helm/ArgoCD manifests; SLOs and budgets; on‑call & DR runbooks; role‑based packaging and multi‑year pricing with ramp.

# 3) Partner “Better Together” — Primes / SIs (1‑Pager)

**Why Partner:** Accelerate task‑order wins and program delivery with a governed AI + graph substrate that drops into your solutions and clears security reviews faster.

## Joint Value Proposition
- **Faster Delivery:** Prebuilt connectors, schema registry, and task kits reduce integration time by 30–50%.  
- **Governance Out‑of‑Box:** OPA/ABAC, DLP/export gates, provenance & audit satisfy compliance teams.  
- **Deploy Anywhere:** Cloud/on‑prem/air‑gap patterns; pilot→production path with micro‑canary and blue/green.

## Reference Architecture (textual)
- Your **mission apps** ↔ **Summit API Gateway (GraphQL)** with OPA/ABAC  
- **Maestro Conductor** routes tasks to approved experts/agents (attested, SBOMed)  
- **IntelGraph** provides tri‑pane analyst workspace and graph services  
- **Connectors** to customer data (STIX/TAXII, SIEM, OSINT, CSV/S3, ESRI/Elastic)  
- **Prov‑Ledger** records chain‑of‑custody; **Observability** emits SLO/cost telemetry

## Engagement Model
- **Teaming:** Pre‑position on vehicles; Summit as sub or tech provider; joint capture (capture brief, discriminators).  
- **Commercial:** Referral (10–15%) or Resell (15–25%) margins based on role & services wrap.  
- **Delivery:** 2‑week technical spike → 6–12 week pilot → production handoff; shared success criteria.

## What We Provide
- **Partner Kit:** APIs/SDKs, connector quickstarts, “better together” diagrams, demo assets, evidence bundle template.
