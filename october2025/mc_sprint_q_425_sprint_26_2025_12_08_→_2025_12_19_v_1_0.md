# MC Sprint — Q4’25 / Sprint 26 (2025‑12‑08 → 2025‑12‑19)
**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2025-12-08-sprint26-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q4’25 “Foundations GA” (Stabilize & Scale)

---
## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star
**Stabilize → Scale → Prepare Q1.** Consolidate GA learnings, expand controlled GA tenants, take **Billing/Metering** from MVP to
“invoice‑trusted”, land **Offline Kit 1.5** reliability, close SOC2 Type I follow‑ups, and finish **Connector family tail (T24‑D)**. Lock Q1’26 OKRs & roadmap with seeded RFCs (Federated Search, Explainability 2.0, Marketplace Discovery).

**Sprint Goal:** Achieve burn‑free operations (no SLO burn alarms >2h cumulative), invoice‑trusted metering, and a crisp onboarding factory that brings two additional tenants to production with signed provenance workflows end‑to‑end.

**Success KPIs:**
- SLO: **0** Sev‑1 incidents; cumulative burn alarms **< 2h**; p95 (4‑hop/100k) **≤ 0.95s**  
- Onboarding: **+2** new production tenants (total ≥ 7 GA)  
- Predictive: **+2** controlled‑GA tenants (total ≥ 5) with audit sampling ≥ **99%**  
- Billing/Metering: invoice variance **≤ 1%** vs shadow; 100% signed exports delivered  
- Offline 1.5: preflight pass rate **≥ 99.5%**; resume success **≥ 99.9%**  
- Connectors **T24‑D**: 24/24 with manifests, DPIA, license/TOS checks, golden IO tests  
- Compliance: SOC2 follow‑ups **0** open P1/P2; quarterly access review exports filed

---
## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals
### In‑Scope
- Post‑GA stabilization: noisy‑alert cleanup, autoscaling guardrails, hot path cache warmers v2.  
- Tenant onboarding factory v2: self‑serve persisted‑query packs, policy simulator export, DPIA + license evidence.  
- Billing/Metering **v0.9**: cost explorer for finance, signed rollups w/ drift detector + external audit sample.  
- Predictive controlled GA expansion: allow‑list, quotas, exemplar library & red‑team sandbox.  
- Offline Kit **1.5**: preflight/resume hardening, operator safety nets, signed divergence digest v2.  
- Connectors tranche **T24‑D** (final Q4 tail).  
- Compliance & governance: SOC2 follow‑ups; quarterly **access reviews** & change‑management packet.  
- Q1’26 roadmap/OKRs—finalize, publish RFC seeds.

### Non‑Goals
- Predictive open GA.  
- Public marketplace or self‑serve onboarding (discovery only).

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **Holiday coverage & fatigue** → paired rotations; pre‑approved rollback; comms macros.  
- **Metering drift** → continuous shadow compare; alarms; sampling audits.  
- **Policy regressions for new tenants** → policy simulator packs; supervised overrides; audit trails.  
- **Predictive misuse** → quotas; sandbox; exemplar guidance; rollback playbook.  
- **Offline edge failures** → power‑loss chaos; resume strategies; operator safety nets.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- SLO burn, p95 by tenant, autoscale actions, onboarding throughput, billing variance, predictive usage/audit %, offline preflight/resume success, connector pass rate, SOC2 follow‑ups closed.  
- Weekly: burndown, scope ledger, blocker aging, OKR readiness.
