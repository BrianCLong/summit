[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Feb 3 – Feb 14, 2026 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Inline Explainability Agent + Auto-Diff Builder — interpret prompts on entry, expose output divergence on exit.
- **Workstream Theme:** Explain at Source, Trace to Sink — every transformation must be auditable.
- **Target Output:** Embedded explainer, semantic diff tool, override feedback loop.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE
- Prompt sanitization now blocks known risks, but ambiguity still enters — inline guidance increases analyst leverage.
- Divergent outputs from similar prompts require **semantic comparison**, not just syntax or logs.
- Feedback loop closes the pipeline: human-in-the-loop override feeds the classifier retrain set.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Feb 3–14)
1. **Inline Explainer Agent**
   - Renders prompt risks, variant predictions, intent classification at edit time.  
   - Offers canonical alternatives or explains blocked terms.
2. **Replay Auto-Diff Engine**
   - Compare causal chains across two prompts or two runs.  
   - Highlight semantically critical divergences (claim shift, node omission).
3. **Explainer Feedback Loop**
   - Capture analyst acceptance, override, correction.  
   - Retrain prompt scorer with feedback batch.
4. **Override Audit Register**
   - Log all user-bypassed warnings, accepted risks.  
   - Emit alerts if override hits known-volatile path.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)
- Visual explanation tracer per edge/node  
- Adaptive prompt shaping based on task context

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE
- **Sources:** Prompt interface logs, replay traces, classifier deltas.
- **Assumptions:** Live prompt editor integration supports synchronous inference.
- **Uncertainty:** Analyst override accuracy not yet validated.
- **Verification:**
  - Diff trace validation across identical graph segments
  - Override review sampling
  - Explainer usage telemetry
