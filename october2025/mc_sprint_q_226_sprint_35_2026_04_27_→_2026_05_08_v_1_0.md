# MC Sprint — Q2’26 / Sprint 35 (2026‑04‑27 → 2026‑05‑08)

**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2026-04-27-sprint35-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q2’26 “Scale & Pilotization” (wave 3)

---

## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star

**Operational Excellence at Scale.** With FS in (or near) open GA and Predictive either rolled out or remediated, focus on **operational polish**, **partner‑grade reliability**, and **evidence‑first governance**. Grow **Marketplace Discovery (MP‑D)** pilot with partner feedback loops, raise **XAI‑2** signal quality and latency SLOs, and drive **Onboarding Factory v2** throughput while keeping **Metering** spotless for monthly close.

**Sprint Goal:** Lock GA‑caliber operations: FS quality & complaint rates well under thresholds, Predictive stable under real tenant load, MP‑D pilot delivering vetted packets at volume, XAI‑2 exports fast and complete, metering exports pristine, and two tenants onboarded via packs.

**Success KPIs:**

- SLO: **0** Sev‑1; burn alarms **< 12m** total; p95 (4‑hop/100k) **≤ 0.84s**
- FS GA: GA tenants’ e2e p95 **≤ 1.20s**, complaint rate **< 1.0%**, ctr@5 ≥ **+6%** vs baseline
- Predictive: coverage **≥ 80%** of GA tenants, audits **≥ 99%**, zero rollbacks
- MP‑D pilot: **10–12** sources live with DPIA/license packets; median request‑to‑connect SLT **< 2d**
- XAI‑2: export coverage **≥ 98%**; counterfactual hints **≥ 92%**; export p95 **≤ 180ms**
- Metering: variance **≤ 0.25%**; 100% tenants received scheduled exports
- Onboarding: **+2** tenants live via factory v2; zero go‑live policy blocks

---

## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals

### In‑Scope

- **FS GA ops:** quality dashboards (ctr@5/success@5/complaints), stitched provenance bundles, license‑aware blending regression tests, fallback to single index.
- **Predictive ops:** quotas, abuse rules, on‑call playbooks, model card 1.4 customer view, rollback rehearsal smoke.
- **MP‑D pilot:** expand sources, add partner feedback loop, signed audit packets & SLA tracker.
- **XAI‑2 ops:** export latency SLOs, failure buckets, a11y copy, caveat banners, opt‑out accounting.
- **Metering month‑end:** rotation rehearsal, drift alarms, invoice preview batch, finance dashboard polish.
- **Onboarding factory v2:** two tenants, policy simulator, appeal tokens, evidence bundles.
- **Ops hygiene:** warmers v3 tuning, noisy‑alert pruning, access review exports, runbook automation (tier‑1).

### Non‑Goals

- MP‑D commercial transactions.
- FS personalized ranking beyond current blending & policy gates.
