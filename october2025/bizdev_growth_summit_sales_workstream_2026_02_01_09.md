## 6) Risks & Mitigations
- **Security stalls** → CFK gate; office hours; pre‑answered FAQ; audit‑log exemplars.  
- **Vehicle uncertainty** → Early KO/CS alignment; multiple route options; teaming with primes.  
- **Partner attribution gaps** → Mandatory tagging; dashboard review; shared follow‑up SLAs.  
- **Pilot scope creep** → Minimal viable scope; milestone credits; rollback plan.
