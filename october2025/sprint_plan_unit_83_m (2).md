[ORACLE MODE – Fusion & Forecast]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Sprint Window Proposal:** Oct 20 – Oct 31, 2025 (2-week cadence)
- **Focus:** Deepen IntelGraph trust chain: claim provenance simulation, reasoning drift detection, and red team trials.
- **Workstream Theme:** Trust, tested and traceable — attack the graph with red-cell logic, audit trace resilience.
- **Target Output:** Hardened, verified graph path and export trail with RAG/LLM drift tests and emulation outputs.

---

## FINDINGS & RATIONALE
- The previous sprint (Oct 6–17) laid groundwork for evidence confidence, provenance locking, and ABAC enforcement.
- Existing tripwire planning and lineage hash trees offer structural integrity but untested resilience.
- Gaps remain in reasoning robustness (NL→Cypher), LLM-induced drift, and export chain manipulation vectors.

To close the loop, this sprint focuses on **attack simulation**, **resilience scoring**, and **LLM vulnerability modeling** to assert graph security under stress.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY OBJECTIVES (Sprint: Oct 20–31)
1. **RAG Drift Testing Harness**  
   - Build a test set of questions over same graph with varying prompt conditions.  
   - Compare response sets, detect hallucination or policy bypass.
2. **Red Team Trial Protocols**  
   - Emulate graph poisoning, lineage spoofing, and over-permissive query surfaces.  
   - Score attack success vs. SLO breach or audit failure.
3. **Export Integrity Fuzzing**  
   - Introduce edge-case doc types, malformed evidence, and ambiguous licenses.  
   - Track provenance validator responses and false-pass rates.
4. **Drift Diff Dash**  
   - Visualize claim diffs, confidence regression, and assertion variance across runs.

### SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS (Next Sprint)
- OPA Constraint Builder UI
- Federated Graph Policy Compiler

## PROOF-CARRYING INTELLIGENCE
- **Sources:** Prev sprint output, IntelGraph state diff, Maestro logs.
- **Assumptions:** Red team tooling operates in controlled lab context.
- **Uncertainty:** Model-specific drift patterns may vary with vendor.
- **Verification:**
  - Simulated LLM queries + real-time diff visualization
  - Red-team runbook w/ known attack vectors and expected audit triggers
