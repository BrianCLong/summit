# do a gap analysis between the current state of the project and where Recorded Future is going to be. Generate our PRD for MVP-2 and GA that exceeds all of their features measurably.

Performing the gap analysis between the current state of Recorded Future and where they are headed in 2025, then generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for MVP-2 and General Availability (GA) that measurably exceeds their features.

First I'll summarize the current state and upcoming roadmap/features of Recorded Future based on the search results.

Recorded Future Current State:

- Leading advanced cyber threat intelligence platform with real-time, actionable insights.
- Features include threat intelligence, vulnerability intelligence, asset management, risk prioritization, detection of fraud, malware, brand protection, digital footprint mapping, AI text summarization.
- Provides over 9 modules with 100+ integrations.
- AI and Intelligence Graph power threat detection with automation across internal telemetry and external sources.
- Strong capabilities in ransomware lifecycle mitigation, third party threat intelligence, attack surface discovery, and vulnerability management.
- Backed by Mastercard acquisition; strong in financial services.
- Used by governments, enterprises spanning tech, media, healthcare, telco, manufacturing.
- Uses generative AI to speed detection of compromised cards on illegal sites.
- Emphasis on integration with SOAR, SIEM, ticketing systems.
- Continuous monitoring, compliance monitoring, asset discovery.

Upcoming 2025 Roadmap and Enhancements:

- Expanded ransomware mitigation with holistic attack lifecycle visibility.
- Enhanced third party intelligence customization and tracking.
- Updates across modules including collection and geopolitical threat use cases.
- Autonomous Threat Operations with AI-powered real-time threat response.
- Integration increasing between Mastercard payment platform and Recorded Future intelligence.
- More AI-driven automated insight generation and situational awareness.
- Expanded data sources and intelligence graph real-time updates.
- Expansion of generative AI to improve threat detection and analysis speed.

Next step is to structure a gap analysis and then the PRD targeting MVP-2 and GA phases that exceed these capabilities measurably. I will now proceed to consolidate this into a clear response with gap analysis and PRD outline.Here is a gap analysis summary between the current Recorded Future platform and its 2025 roadmap, followed by a PRD outline for MVP-2 and GA that measurably exceeds Recorded Future’s capabilities.

This approach produces a platform that outperforms Recorded Future by introducing autonomous AI-driven threat operations, predictive simulations for attack surface and vulnerability management, open orchestration layer for extensibility, and cross-domain physical-cyber intelligence fusion with supply chain risk foresight.

If desired, these can be broken down further into detailed user stories, technical specs, and milestone timelines. Would you like to proceed with that?
