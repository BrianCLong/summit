**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2026-05-11-sprint36-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0

**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q2’26 “Scale & Pilotization” (wave 4)

## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star
**Polish at Scale; Prep H2 Bets.** Cement FS **open‑GA** quality under heavier usage, keep **Predictive** rock‑solid across most tenants, expand **Marketplace Discovery (MP‑D)** pilot footprint with compliance guardrails, drive **XAI‑2** export latency lower, close **Metering** to finance standards, and increase **Onboarding Factory v2** throughput. Seed H2 epics (Federated Search v2, Marketplace transactions discovery, Explainability 2.1) with RFCs.

**Sprint Goal:** Zero‑drama operations at scale; MP‑D pilot ≥12–14 sources; XAI exports both **complete** and **fast**; finance sign‑off on month‑to‑date metering; +2 tenants onboarded via self‑serve packs; H2 RFC seeds merged.

**Success KPIs:**
- SLO: **0** Sev‑1; burn alarms **< 10m** total; p95 (4‑hop/100k) **≤ 0.83s**  
- FS GA: e2e p95 **≤ 1.18s**; complaint rate **< 0.9%**; ctr@5 ≥ **+6%** vs baseline  
- Predictive: tenant coverage **≥ 85%**, audits **≥ 99%**, zero rollbacks  
- MP‑D pilot: **12–14** sources live; median request‑to‑connect SLT **< 36h**  
- XAI‑2: export coverage **≥ 98.5%**; counterfactual hints **≥ 93%**; export p95 **≤ 160ms**  
- Metering: variance **≤ 0.25%**; 100% tenants received scheduled exports  
- Onboarding: **+2** tenants live; zero go‑live policy blocks  
- H2 seeds: **3 RFCs** merged (FS v2 planner, MP‑D transactions discovery, XAI‑2.1 UX/data model)

---
## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals
### In‑Scope
- **FS GA ops @ scale:** quality dashboards, stitched provenance bundles, license‑aware blending regression tests, single‑index fallback drills.
- **Predictive GA ops:** quotas & abuse, on‑call drills, model card 1.4 surfaced, rollback smoke.
- **MP‑D pilot expansion:** partner intake SOP, DPIA/license packets, signed audit trails; SLA tracker.
- **XAI‑2 ops:** minimize export latency, bucket failures, a11y copy, caveat banners, opt‑out accounting.
- **Metering month‑end:** rotation rehearsal, drift alarms, invoice preview batch, finance dashboards.
- **Onboarding factory v2:** two tenants via packs with policy sim and evidence bundles.
- **H2 RFC seeds:** author/merge initial RFCs for FS v2 planner, MP‑D transactions discovery, XAI‑2.1.
- **Ops hygiene:** warmers v3 tuning; alert pruning; access review exports; tier‑1 automation polish.

### Non‑Goals
- MP‑D commercial transactions (discovery only).  
- FS rank personalization beyond current blending.
