# MC Sprint — Q4’25 / Sprint 24 (2025‑11‑10 → 2025‑11‑21)
**Slug:** `mc-sprint-2025-11-10-sprint24-v1-0-0`  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025‑09‑29 (America/Denver)  
**Team:** Mission Control (MC)  
**Release Train:** Q4’25 “Foundations GA” (wave 4 — GA Cutover)

---
## 0) Sprint Theme & North Star
**Cutover to GA (controlled).** Finalize production hardening, complete compliance evidence for **SOC2 Type I** sign‑off, move **Predictive Suite** from preview → **controlled GA** for allow‑listed tenants, ship **Offline Kit 1.3** with automated rollback of divergent merges, and expand connector coverage to **T20‑C**. Lock GA checklist, run an end‑to‑end DR drill, and freeze change windows ahead of release week.

**Sprint Goal:** A GA‑eligible build with audited provenance, tested blue/green & DR, complete controls evidence, and a minimal yet delightful operator UX. Connectors at 20 with airtight licenses and mapping evidence.

**Success KPIs:**
- p95 (4‑hop/100k) **< 1.0s** on prod‑like shadow  
- Blue/green switch **< 3m**; DR RTO **< 15m**, RPO **< 60s** (staging DR)  
- Cost Guard: ≥ **10** valid blocks; **0** critical false blocks  
- Predictive controlled GA: **3 tenants** live; audit coverage **100%**  
- Offline 1.3: automatic rollback renders clean state on 99th‑percentile conflict  
- SOC2 Type I binder **100%** submitted; gap remediation tickets closed  
- Connectors **T20‑C** complete (20/20 with manifests, DPIA, license/TOS checks, golden IO tests)

---
## 1) Scope & Non‑Goals
### In‑Scope
- GA checklist execution; change‑freeze protocol; cutover rehearsals.  
- Disaster Recovery (DR) drill: backup/restore, key rotation under DR, verifier re‑sign.  
- Predictive Suite: guardrail polish; per‑tenant quotas; operator throttles; model card 1.2.  
- Offline Kit 1.3: conflict auto‑rollback, operator safe‑harbor undo, enhanced divergence report.  
- Connectors T20‑C; mapping wizard final polish; reviewer queues & SLAs.  
- Compliance: SOC2 Type I evidence finalization; secure SDLC attestations; access reviews; vendor DPAs.  
- Pen‑test remediation round‑up (P1/P2 only).

### Non‑Goals
- Public marketplace listing or self‑serve onboarding.  
- Predictive Suite open GA (remain controlled GA this wave).

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **DR surprise gaps** → pre‑drill inventory; practice runs; verifier re‑sign rehearsal.  
- **Policy regressions under load** → shadow traffic + fuzz; persisted‑query warmers.  
- **Predictive misuse at GA** → quotas, throttles, audit sampling; rollback playbooks.  
- **A11y regressions** → automated checks in CI; keyboard‑only test pass.  
- **License rule drift** → checksum registry; human review queue; dual‑control overrides.

---
## 10) Metrics & Reporting
- Latency & hot‑path heatmaps; DR timing; contradiction & license analytics; cost guard actions; SOC2 evidence coverage; connector pass rate.  
- Weekly: burndown, scope ledger, blocker aging, GA readiness scoreboard.

---
## 11) Demo Script (10–12 min)
1. GA checklist in UI → freeze window toggle → rollback rehearsal.  
2. DR drill replay (time‑compressed): restore, key rotation, verifier re‑sign success.  
3. Persisted query warmers: before/after latency deltas.  
4. Predictive controlled GA tenant run; model card 1.2; audit sample.  
5. Cost Guard: heavy query blocked with actionable hints; appeal analytics.  
6. Offline 1.3: induce conflict, show auto‑rollback + signed report.  
7. Connectors T20‑C: license gate check; golden tests snapshot; a11y walkthrough.

---
## 12) Backlog Index & Sizing
- GA/DR: 6 stories @ 5–8 pts  
- Core/policy polish: 4 stories @ 3–5 pts  
- Provenance/compliance: 4 stories @ 3–5 pts  
- Predictive GA: 3 stories @ 5–8 pts  
- Offline 1.3: 3 stories @ 3–5 pts  
- Connectors T20‑C: 20 × (2–5 pts)

---
## 13) Change Log (for this sprint plan)
- **v1.0.0 (2025‑09‑29):** Initial Sprint 24 plan; GA cutover, DR drill, Predictive controlled GA, Offline 1.3, T20‑C connectors, SOC2 Type I binder complete.
