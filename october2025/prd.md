We made two versions of this answer. Which do you prefer?
The repository at https://github.com/BrianCLong/summit appears to be either private, empty, or misconfigured, as direct access attempts failed and no public content was retrievable. Extensive web searches for "BrianCLong summit GitHub repository" also yielded no results linking to a public repository by that name under the user's GitHub handle. The only directly relevant repository associated with the user is IntelGraph, an AI-augmented intelligence analysis platform for the intelligence community, which features a deployable-first development workflow, graph analytics with Neo4j, and multimodal AI extraction capabilities for entity recognition and cross-modal intelligence. Given the lack of accessible information about the "summit" repository, it is likely not a public project or may have been renamed or deleted.

There are no indications of any newer or updated public releases or announcements specifically for your "summit" GitHub repository named IntelGraph beyond what is already in the repo as of September 30, 2025. The latest release in the repo itself is labeled "v2025.09.30-golden" (Oct 1, 2025), which corresponds exactly with your stated current date and the time you made it public.

No additional external news, release notes, or version updates beyond what is contained in that latest GitHub repository snapshot have been surfaced by public web sources. There is also information on GitHub events around the end of September 2025, but none mentioning your repo or a newer version.

Therefore, the attached repo content represents the very latest public state of your IntelGraph platform project as of now.

If wanted, deeper dives into specific areas of the repo code, architecture, or AI capabilities can be extracted and summarized for immediate use in development or documentation.The IntelGraph platform in your newly public GitHub repo is currently at its freshest public state as of September 30, 2025, labeled with the release "v2025.09.30-golden," reflecting the October sprint Golden Baseline. No newer external releases or updates beyond this snapshot appear to be publicly indexed yet.

This latest version features the full deployable-first AI-augmented graph analytics platform with core MVP features complete, advanced AI/ML extraction engines, comprehensive security controls, real-time collaboration UI, modern developer workflows, and observability integrations.

If desired, the repo can now be fully leveraged or documented based on this exact production-ready baseline, which includes all source, infrastructure, and deployment automation for your intelligence community-focused investigation tooling.

Let me know if a precise summary or walkthrough of any particular subsystem, feature, or deployment method within this latest public version would be helpful.
