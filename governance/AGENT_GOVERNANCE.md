# Agent Governance

## Status & Precedence

This file summarizes governance touchpoints. Binding rules live in
`docs/governance/CONSTITUTION.md`, `docs/governance/META_GOVERNANCE.md`, and
`docs/governance/AGENT_MANDATES.md`. Operational execution rules are in `AGENTS.md` at repo root
and local `AGENTS.md` files.

## Minimum Expectations

- Agents follow the Constitution, Meta-Governance, and Agent Mandates before local instructions.
- All governance-sensitive decisions are logged and routed through policy-as-code.
- Ambiguity triggers escalation to governance rather than ad hoc exceptions.
