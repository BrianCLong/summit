# Regulatory Definitions

## Glossary

### Capture

The condition where a regulatory body is effectively controlled or overly influenced by the industry it is supposed to regulate. We strictly avoid this.

### Clean Hands

The state of having no hidden conflicts of interest, no off-the-books agreements, and no reliance on "grey area" interpretations of the law.

### Policy-as-Code

The practice of defining regulatory and ethical rules in a programming language (Rego) that can be executed automatically, ensuring deterministic enforcement.

### Provenance

The unforgeable history of an object or decision. In our context, the complete chain of custody for every data point and AI inference.

### Quid-Pro-Quo

"Something for something." An exchange of favors. Strictly prohibited in all regulatory interactions.

### Revolving Door

The practice of hiring former regulators immediately into lobbying or compliance roles to leverage their personal connections. We enforce a "Cooling Off" period.
