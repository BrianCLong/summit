# Regulatory Strategy Memo

## Executive Summary

Our strategy is to treat regulation not as a hindrance to be minimized, but as a set of requirement specifications to be automated. We aim to convert "compliance cost" into "compliance feature velocity."

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Compliance as Infrastructure

Instead of building "compliant products," we build a "compliant infrastructure" (IntelGraph) that makes non-compliance technically impossible for applications built on top of it.

### 2. The "Glass House" Approach

We assume that all our internal decision logic will eventually be public. We design for that day. This forces clean architecture and eliminates "dark patterns."

### 3. Weaponized Transparency

We use our ability to be transparent as a competitive advantage against entrenched competitors who rely on opacity. By raising the standard of required transparency, we force competitors to incur costs they cannot sustain.

## Goals for Q3-Q4

1.  Achieve 100% Policy-as-Code coverage for GDPR and AI Act requirements.
2.  Publish our internal "Ethics Guardrails" as an open standard.
3.  Establish the "Clean Hands" brand in the EU market.
