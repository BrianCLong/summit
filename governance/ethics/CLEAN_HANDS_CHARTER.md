# Clean Hands Charter

## Purpose

This document establishes the board-approved intent to operate with absolute ethical clarity in all regulatory and competitive environments. It serves as the primary "ethics perimeter" for the organization.

## Core Tenets

### 1. Zero Tolerance for Regulatory Capture

We do not seek to capture regulators. We seek to empower them with transparency.

- **Prohibited:** Drafting private legislation, offering quid-pro-quo benefits, or engaging in "revolving door" hiring practices for influence.
- **Required:** All regulatory interactions must be documented and, where legally permissible, public.

### 2. Radical Transparency

Our systems are designed to be auditable by default.

- **Prohibited:** "Black box" algorithms in critical decision paths.
- **Required:** Provenance logs for all AI decisions, accessible to oversight bodies.

### 3. Competitor Engagement

We compete on merit and technical superiority, not political entrenchment.

- **Prohibited:** Smear campaigns or non-public lobbying against competitors.
- **Required:** Use public standards to expose competitor lock-in.

## Operational Enforcement

This charter is enforced via Policy-as-Code (OPA). Violations of these tenets in code or process are treated as critical security incidents.
