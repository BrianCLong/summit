# Ethics Escalation Path

## Purpose

To provide a safe, clear, and mandatory path for escalating ethical concerns or potential violations of the Clean Hands Charter.

## Escalation Levels

### Level 1: Automated Policy Violation

- **Trigger:** OPA policy denial or CI/CD check failure.
- **Action:** Developer must fix the code to comply. No override allowed without Level 3 approval.

### Level 2: Ambiguity / Grey Area

- **Trigger:** A situation where the "Clean Hands Charter" is unclear.
- **Action:** File a formal "Ethics Clarification Request" (ECR).
- **Response:** Governance Team must issue a public ruling within 72 hours.

### Level 3: Critical Incident / Whistleblowing

- **Trigger:** Evidence of intentional bypass of ethics controls, or external pressure to violate the charter.
- **Action:** Direct report to the Board Ethics Committee.
- **Protection:** Whistleblowers are protected by non-retaliation clauses and the technical inability of the system to trace anonymous reports.
