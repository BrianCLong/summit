# Our Approach to Regulation and Governance

Summit is designed to operate responsibly in regulated environments without relying on special treatment, exemptions, or private influence.

We engage with regulators and standards bodies transparently and in public or documented forums. We do not seek to shape regulation through private agreements or undisclosed advocacy.

Our systems are built with:

* Policy-as-code enforcement
* Full auditability and provenance
* Jurisdiction-aware compliance
* Independent review readiness

We believe regulation should protect users and markets. Our goal is to make compliance automatic, verifiable, and scalable—so innovation and accountability can advance together.
