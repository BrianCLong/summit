# Governance Disclosure

## Commitment to the Public

This document outlines our public commitments to ethical AI and corporate governance.

## 1. Algorithmic Accountability

We commit to providing an explanation for any decision made by our AI systems that significantly affects an individual or organization. This explanation will be based on cryptographic provenance, not post-hoc rationalization.

## 2. No Secret Rules

We will not enforce hidden rules or shadow-bans. Our content moderation and ranking policies will be published as open-source logic whenever safety allows.

## 3. Data Sovereignty

We recognize that user data belongs to the user. We act as a custodian, not an owner. We commit to zero lock-in; users can export their data and its lineage at any time.

## 4. Auditor Access

Accredited 3rd-party auditors will be granted direct, read-only access to our compliance logs and policy definitions to verify our adherence to these commitments.
