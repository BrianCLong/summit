## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

| Risk                              | Severity | Mitigation                       | Status       |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Policy drift between environments | Medium   | SHA256 pinning + verification    | âœ… Mitigated |
| Provenance chain break            | High     | SLSA attestation + SBOM          | âœ… Mitigated |
| Air-gap bundle tampering          | High     | Checksum manifest + verification | âœ… Mitigated |
| Unauthorized policy changes       | Critical | Git tag protection + IGAC review | âœ… Mitigated |

### Residual Risks

1. **Policy interpretation ambiguity** (Low)
   - Mitigation: Explainability panel provides context
   - Acceptance: Risk accepted with monitoring

2. **Air-gap transfer integrity** (Low)
   - Mitigation: Multi-layer checksum verification
   - Acceptance: Risk accepted with documented procedures
