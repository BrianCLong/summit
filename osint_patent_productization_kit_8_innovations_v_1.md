## 3) Innovation‑by‑Innovation Packs

### IN‑001 — Adaptive OSINT Access Engine
**IDF Title:** Self‑healing, persona‑orchestrated access for resilient OSINT collection
**Core Insight:** Treat access as a policy‑bounded, learning marketplace: swap personas, routes, and fetch tactics under a cost/legality governor with continuous drift sensing.

**Illustrative Claim Thesis:**
- *Novelty:* joint optimization of (persona, route, fetch‑plan) under site‑specific behavioral constraints + feedback from drift detectors.

**Method Claim (draft):**
1. A method for resilient data acquisition comprising: (a) profiling a source by passively estimating behavioral constraints; (b) selecting a scraper‑persona and traffic plan by solving a multi‑objective policy that minimizes detection risk and legal cost; (c) executing requests with adaptive pacing and feature toggles; (d) monitoring DOM/API drift by structural fingerprints; (e) mutating the fetch‑plan using a learned refactoring model upon drift; and (f) emitting a provenance log with compliance explanations.

**Key Modules:** persona library; route balancer; drift detector; auto‑refactorer; legality/cost governor; provenance logger.

**IDF Title:** Real‑time anchor‑graph fusion for text, image, video, audio, and structured signals
**Core Insight:** Normalize modalities to anchorable evidence units; perform streaming joins around anchors with uncertainty propagation.

**Method Claim (draft):** receive multi‑modal inputs → compute normalized anchors (faceprint, voiceprint, handle, keyphrase, device fingerprint) → maintain an anchor‑graph with per‑edge uncertainty → perform streaming joins to update entity hypotheses → surface alerts when posterior belief crosses thresholds → emit explainable bundles.

**Modules:** modality normalizer; anchor generator; streaming joiner; uncertainty engine; explain panel.

**Benchmarks:** *Fusion‑Latency P95* (<1s at 50k anchors); *Entity‑F1*; *Explain Coverage* (citations per assertion).
