definitions:
  releasable_main: Main is releasable when Release Train dashboard marks candidate_type=main as promotable_state=success.
  time_to_green: Minutes between merge commit timestamp and last required gate success for that commit.
  flake: A gate is flaky if it required multiple runs or attempts for the same commit before success.
  gate_duration: Gate runtime derived from GitHub Actions run started_at to updated_at for matched workflows.
  policy_drift: Count of soft gate violations and branch protection mismatches (intentionally constrained until governance feed wired).
