This project ingests metadata and short summaries from the [tmgthb/Autonomous-Agents](https://github.com/tmgthb/Autonomous-Agents) repository (MIT license at the repository level). Summit stores extracted paper metadata, bullet summaries, and provenance fields (source path, commit SHA, repository URL) to maintain traceability back to the original source. No upstream content beyond short bullets is copied verbatim, and all records retain source identifiers for citation and deduplication.
