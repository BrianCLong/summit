# Topicality Summit Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
Version 2.0 (IntelGraph / Topicality Summit)

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted
by you to Topicality LLC, Topicality Summit, and Brian C. Long (collectively,
the "Licensor") for any Contributions you submit to any Topicality Summit
repositories or related projects (each, a "Project"). By submitting a
Contribution, you accept the terms below on behalf of yourself and your
organization (if applicable). If you are submitting on behalf of an
organization, you represent that you are authorized to bind that
organization.

## 1. Definitions
- **Contribution**: Any source code, object code, documentation, data,
  feedback, patches, designs, models, prompts, tests, or other materials that
  you submit to a Project in any form.
- **Submit**: Any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
  to the Project or its maintainers, including but not limited to pull
  requests, patches, feature suggestions, issue comments, or emails.
- **You** (or **Your**): The individual or legal entity submitting the
  Contribution.

## 2. Work Made for Hire and Assignment
To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree that your Contributions are
"work made for hire" for the Licensor. To the extent any Contribution (or any
portion of it) is not considered a work made for hire, you hereby assign and
transfer to the Licensor all right, title, and interest in and to the
Contribution, including all intellectual property rights. Where assignment is
not permitted, you grant the Licensor an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable,
worldwide, royalty-free license (with rights to sublicense) to use,
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise exploit the
Contribution without restriction. You will execute documents and take actions
reasonably requested to perfect these rights.

## 3. Copyright License Grant
You grant the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, make
available, and distribute your Contributions and any derivative works.

## 4. Patent License Grant
You grant the Licensor and its recipients a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to
make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer
your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone
or in combination with the Project to which it was submitted.

## 5. Moral Rights and Waiver
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you waive and agree not to
assert any moral rights in your Contributions, including rights of
attribution and integrity, against the Licensor and its recipients.

## 6. Source of Contributions; Third-Party Works
You represent and warrant that:
- Each Contribution is your original creation, or you otherwise have
  sufficient rights to grant the licenses and assignments above; and
- Your Contribution does not knowingly infringe or misappropriate any
  intellectual property or proprietary rights of a third party; and
- No Contribution contains confidential or export-controlled information,
  unless expressly agreed in writing by the Licensor; and
- If any part of your Contribution is based on, derived from, or includes
  third-party works, you will clearly identify the source and license of
  those works in your submission and comply with any additional requirements
  stated by the Licensor for incorporating third-party code or assets.

## 7. Certifications
By submitting a Contribution, you certify that:
- The Contribution was created in compliance with applicable laws, including
  export control and sanctions regimes;
- If you are an individual, you are legally entitled to grant the licenses,
  assignments, and waivers above; and
- If you are acting on behalf of an organization, you have the authority to
  bind that organization, and the organization accepts the terms of this
  Agreement.

## 8. Support, Warranties, and Acceptance
You provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" basis without warranties of any
kind. The Licensor is not obligated to provide support for your Contributions
or to include them in any Project. The Licensor may decline to accept or may
remove any Contribution at its discretion.

## 9. Publicity
Except as required for standard attribution or license notices, neither party
will use the other's name, logos, or trademarks without prior written
permission.

## 10. Termination
This Agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated by written notice.
The licenses, assignments, and waivers granted for Contributions already
submitted survive any termination. Sections intended by their nature to
survive will survive termination.

## 11. Entire Agreement
This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement
between you and the Licensor regarding Contributions to the Projects and
supersedes all prior proposals, understandings, and agreements, whether oral
or written, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
