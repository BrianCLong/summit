# Evidence Service

The evidence service collects witness chains, replay tokens, and metric outputs for evaluator review.

- Stores Merkle commitments for pipeline artifacts and tier manifests.
- Generates peer-review packages combining interface docs, logs, and minimal datasets.
- Publishes digests to the transparency log and links them to attestation evidence when available.
