# Structured PromptPacks

This directory contains JSON-based prompt templates (PromptPacks) that enforce the Summit AI Coding Policy.

## Directory Structure
- `schema/`: JSON schemas for validating PromptPacks.
- `templates/`: Pre-defined templates for common tasks.

## Usage
These templates are designed to be consumed by agents or IDE helpers to ensure all mandatory policy sections (Goal, Constraints, Non-goals, etc.) are present and formatted correctly.
