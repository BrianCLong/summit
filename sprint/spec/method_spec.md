# IntelGraph Platform - Method Specification

## Formal Specification of Proposed Improvements

### Core Architecture Overview

#### System Components

1. **React Client** - Frontend application with graph visualization
2. **GraphQL API** - Backend with Apollo Server
3. **Neo4j** - Graph database for entities and relationships
4. **PostgreSQL** - Relational database for metadata
5. **TimescaleDB** - Time-series database for metrics
6. **Redis** - Cache and session storage
7. **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** - Authorization policies
8. **AI/ML Pipeline** - Multimodal analysis components

#### API Interface Specification

```graphql
type Entity {
  id: ID!
  type: String!
  props: JSON
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime
}

type Relationship {
  id: ID!
  from: ID!
  to: ID!
  type: String!
  props: JSON
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

type Investigation {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  entities: [Entity!]!
  relationships: [Relationship!]!
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

type Query {
  entities(type: String, limit: Int = 25): [Entity!]!
  semanticSearch(query: String!, limit: Int = 10): [Entity!]!
  investigation(id: ID!): Investigation
}

type Mutation {
  createEntity(input: EntityInput!): Entity
  createInvestigation(input: InvestigationInput!): Investigation
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

- **Entity Search**: O(log n) with proper indexing
- **Relationship Traversal**: O(k) where k is the number of related entities
- **Graph Analytics**: Varies by algorithm (centrality: O(n²), pathfinding: O(n + m))
- **AI Processing**: O(n) for linear model processing, varies for deep learning models

#### Space Complexity

- **Graph Storage**: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges
- **Cache Layer**: O(c) where c is cache capacity
- **AI Model Memory**: O(m) where m is model size

### Core Invariants

#### Data Integrity Invariants

1. **Entity-Relationship Consistency**: All relationship references must point to existing entities
2. **Type Safety**: Entity types must be valid according to schema
3. **Temporal Consistency**: Creation timestamps must be chronological
4. **Unique Identification**: All entities and relationships must have globally unique IDs

#### System State Invariants

1. **Authorization**: All API operations must pass OPA policy checks
2. **Rate Limiting**: Request rates must not exceed configured thresholds
3. **Session Validity**: JWT tokens must be valid and not expired
4. **Database Connection**: All database operations must maintain connection integrity

### Proposed Enhancements

#### 1. Enhanced Graph Analytics Module

- **Algorithm**: Centrality measures (betweenness, closeness, eigenvector)
- **Implementation**: Neo4j Graph Data Science library integration
- **Performance Target**: Sub-second response for graphs up to 100K nodes
- **Complexity**: O(n²) for betweenness centrality, O(n log n) for PageRank

#### 2. Real-time Collaboration Framework

- **Mechanism**: WebSocket-based real-time updates
- **Conflict Resolution**: Operational Transformation or CRDTs
- **Performance Target**: < 100ms latency for collaborative updates
- **Concurrency Model**: Optimistic concurrency control

#### 3. Intelligent Entity Resolution

- **Algorithm**: Probabilistic entity matching with ML-based similarity
- **Implementation**: Fuzzy matching + vector embeddings
- **Complexity**: O(n) for approximate matching with indexing
- **Accuracy Target**: >95% precision for high-confidence matches

#### 4. Adaptive Caching Strategy

- **Caching Layer**: Multi-tier cache (in-memory, Redis, CDN)
- **Eviction Policy**: LRU with TTL and access pattern analysis
- **Consistency Model**: Eventual consistency with cache invalidation
- **Performance Target**: >95% cache hit rate for common queries

#### 5. Advanced AI/ML Pipeline

- **Modalities**: Text, image, audio, video processing
- **Processing**: NLP, computer vision, speech recognition
- **Pipeline**: Asynchronous job queue with priority scheduling
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling based on workload

### Interface Specifications
