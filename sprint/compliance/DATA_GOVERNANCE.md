## Data Retention Policies

### Temporary Data (Automatically Deleted)

- Session data: 30 days after session end
- Cache data: Configured TTL (typically 1-7 days)
- Log data: 90 days (security logs: 7 years)

### Operational Data (Manual Review)

- User accounts: Until account deletion request
- Investigations: As per customer policy or legal requirements
- Audit logs: 7 years for security and compliance

### Archival Data (Long-term Storage)

- Processed intelligence outputs: As per customer requirements
- System configuration: Until system decommission
- Compliance documentation: 7+ years

## Security Controls

### Encryption

- Data at rest: AES-256 encryption
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3
- Key management: Hardware security modules or cloud KMS
- Client-side encryption: Optional for highly sensitive data

### Access Controls

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Session management and timeout

### Audit Logging

- All data access and modification
