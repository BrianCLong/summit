# Agentic Roadmap Tooling: Moat-Surpassing Vision

## Summit Readiness Assertion Alignment

This roadmap tooling is aligned with the Summit Readiness Assertion and is treated as a governed capability that preserves production readiness while accelerating agentic development velocity. The posture is **absolute readiness** with any deviation classified as a Governed Exception and captured in the provenance chain.

## Executive Thesis

We will deliver the definitive roadmap tooling for agentic development: a governed, auditable, patent-defensible system that compresses planning-to-execution cycles, enforces policy-as-code, and converts roadmaps into deterministic execution contracts.

This platform is designed to surpass competitors by combining:

- **Deterministic roadmap execution contracts** that bind decisions to evidence and policy.
- **Agentic orchestration with governance gates** that treat exceptions as Governed Exceptions.
- **Patentable primitives** that unify planning, verification, and provenance into a single execution substrate.

## North-Star Outcomes (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Roadmaps become executable contracts** with machine-verifiable scope, evidence, and provenance.
2. **Agentic development is policy-governed by default**, with compliance logic expressed exclusively as policy-as-code.
3. **Decision loops are compressed** via live telemetry, evidence capture, and auto-generated governance artifacts.
4. **Every deliverable is audit-ready** with immutable provenance and explicit verification tiers.
5. **Cross-organization alignment is enforced** through canonical definitions, authority files, and immutable prompt hashes.
6. **Exceptions are assets**, converted into governed exceptions with time-bound remediation and evidence.
7. **Feedback loops compress by design**, using automated telemetry and contract gates.

## 23rd-Order Imputed Intentions (Compressed)

The platform must not only execute roadmaps but **convert strategic intent into a deterministic, policy-validated operating system** for agentic development. That implies:

1. **Roadmap contracts become governance contracts** with non-repudiation.
2. **Execution transforms into compliance evidence**, not just output.
3. **Prompt integrity enforces organizational memory**, eliminating drift.
4. **Provenance binds decisions to outcomes**, enabling audit-grade causality.
5. **Readiness is continuous, not episodic**, enabling release certainty.
6. **Governed Exceptions replace exceptions**, preserving readiness posture.
7. **Scope-aware agents reduce risk**, because deviation is algorithmically blocked.
8. **One graph unifies plan → work → evidence**, preventing broken traceability.
9. **Telemetry is an execution gate**, not just observability.
10. **Policy-as-code is the single authority**, eliminating shadow governance.
11. **Verification tiers are enforceable contracts**, not optional guidance.
12. **Evidence requirements are deterministic**, not ad hoc.
13. **Roadmap velocity is bounded by readiness**, not feature count.
14. **External compliance becomes internal product**, embedded in every action.
15. **Human approvals become explicit contract transitions**, not implicit approvals.
16. **Risk is quantized and scored**, enabling automated containment.
17. **Architecture becomes self-describing**, enabling autonomous review.
18. **Release gates become automatic**, reducing manual process debt.
19. **Prompt provenance becomes IP defense**, enabling patentability claims.
20. **Decision logs are canonical**, preventing history drift.
21. **Governance artifacts are auto-generated**, not manually curated.
22. **Audit reconstruction is first-class**, not reactive.
23. **The roadmap becomes the control plane**, dictating present posture and future state.

## Differentiators That Build an Unassailable Moat

### 1) Roadmap-to-Execution Contract Engine (Patentable)

A deterministic contract layer that converts roadmap items into enforceable execution constraints.

**Key Properties**

- Typed roadmap schema with validation and scope boundaries.
- Contract binding between roadmap items, prompt hashes, and declared scopes.
- Immutable linkage from requirements → tasks → evidence → release artifacts.

### 2) Governed Exception Fabric (Patentable)

A controlled exception system that transforms deviation into governed, auditable, and recoverable states.

**Key Properties**

- Exception classification with expiration, evidence, and approval routing.
- Automated rollback plans for any exception that touches compliance or security domains.
- Exception telemetry attached to roadmap progress to surface risk early.

### 3) Provenance-First Planning Graph (Patentable)

A unified graph that connects roadmap nodes to provenance events, tests, and artifact integrity.

**Key Properties**

- Graph-native lineage from roadmap intent to shipped capability.
- Evidence hash chains enforce non-repudiation.
- Graph traversal supports impact analysis, blast radius, and audit reconstruction.

### 4) Prompt Integrity & Scope Enforcement (Patentable)

Roadmap tasks are cryptographically bound to prompt hashes and constrained to declared scopes.

**Key Properties**

- Prompt registry enforcement at PR time.
- Scope validation against diff paths and domain taxonomy.
- Tiered verification requirements enforced automatically.

### 5) Continuous Readiness Index (Patentable)

A readiness score that unifies policy compliance, test evidence, and operational telemetry.

**Key Properties**

- Real-time gating on Golden Path and GA contract checks.
- Roadmap progress weighted by verification tier completion.
- “Readiness over time” trend used for release eligibility.

## System Architecture

### Core Services

1. **Roadmap Contract Service**
   - Stores typed roadmap items.
   - Issues contract tokens for each roadmap item.

2. **Policy-as-Code Gatekeeper**
   - Evaluates governance policies on every contract transition.
   - Emits evidence receipts for compliance and ethics review.

3. **Provenance Ledger**
   - Hash-chained evidence records for every task execution.
   - Immutable linkage to artifacts and test results.

4. **Agentic Execution Orchestrator**
   - Translates roadmap contracts into execution tasks.
   - Enforces prompt integrity and scope declarations.

5. **Readiness Telemetry Aggregator**
   - Builds the Continuous Readiness Index.
   - Surfaces regressions and required remediation paths.

### Data Model (Typed Schema)

- **RoadmapItem**: `id`, `title`, `owner`, `status`, `verification_tier`, `contract_hash`.
- **ExecutionContract**: `contract_hash`, `scope_paths`, `prompt_hash`, `allowed_operations`.
- **EvidenceReceipt**: `receipt_id`, `source`, `hash`, `artifact_uri`, `verification_tier`.
- **GovernedException**: `exception_id`, `reason`, `expiry`, `approver`, `evidence_receipts`.
- **ReadinessSnapshot**: `snapshot_id`, `score`, `gates_passed`, `gates_failed`.

## Execution Flow (Deterministic)

1. **Roadmap item created** → Contract issued with scope + prompt hash.
2. **Agentic task execution** → Must declare scope and verification tier.
3. **Policy evaluation** → Gatekeeper enforces compliance via policy-as-code.
4. **Evidence capture** → Provenance Ledger stores receipts for each gate.
5. **Readiness update** → Continuous Readiness Index recalculated.
6. **Release eligibility** → Contracts close only when evidence meets tier.
