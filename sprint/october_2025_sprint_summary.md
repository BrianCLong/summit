# IntelGraph Platform - October 2025 Sprint Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the completion of the October 2025 sprint for the IntelGraph platform, with a focus on establishing the measurement → control layer and implementing the Aurelius Output Contract.

## Sprint Deliverables

### 1. Aurelius Output Contract Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
All components of the Aurelius Output Contract have been successfully implemented:

- **Executive Summary**: Complete documentation of the IntelGraph platform value proposition
- **Design & Architecture**: Repository map, method specification, and technical documentation
- **Implementation**: Makefile with proxy targets, smoke tests, and hardened patch infrastructure
- **Experiments & Benchmarks**: Configurable benchmark framework with seeded experiments
- **IP Portfolio & Legal**: Patent specification with claims, prior art analysis, and FTO analysis
- **Compliance & Governance**: Third-party dependency analysis, license compliance, and data governance
- **Integration**: Release notes, PR plan, and SDK stubs
- **Commercialization**: Go-to-market brief and kanban board with time-boxed milestones

### 2. Measurement → Control Layer ✅ COMPLETED
The measurement → control layer has been fully implemented with automated gating and actionable feedback:

- **SLO Thresholds & Evaluator**: Hard and soft SLO enforcement with regression guard
- **PR Comment Bot**: Automatic PR comments with performance tables and PASS/FAIL status
- **OpenTelemetry Stubs**: Tracing instrumentation for performance analysis
- **Neo4j PROFILE Capture**: Actionable graph query performance metrics
- **IP/Compliance Trail**: Automatic summary of claims and prior art on PRs

### 3. Infrastructure Hardening ✅ COMPLETED
All infrastructure components have been hardened for production use:

- **Patch System**: Robust patch application with --check and --reverse flags
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated validation
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Quality gates with security scanning
- **Baseline Capture**: Automated baseline establishment and refresh

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Automated Performance Gating
- Hard SLO enforcement in CI (fail if exceeded)
- Soft regression guard (10% default threshold)
- Automatic issue creation on SLO failure with performance tables
- PR comments with rich markdown tables showing PASS/FAIL status

### 2. Actionable Performance Insights
- OpenTelemetry tracing with trace IDs for explainability
- Neo4j PROFILE capture with dbHits and row counts
- Graph analytics with centrality measures and pathfinding
- Semantic search with vector embeddings

### 3. IP-First Approach
- Patent specification with ≥2 independent + ≥8 dependent claims
- Prior art analysis with concrete citations and technical deltas
- FTO analysis with comprehensive claim chart seed
- Automated IP/Compliance trail on PRs

### 4. Production-Ready Infrastructure
- Hardened patch application system with conflict resolution
- CI/CD workflows with comprehensive testing and validation
- Pre-commit hooks with security scanning
- Automated baseline capture and refresh
