# Market Intel Module

This module governs the ingestion and processing of market intelligence signals (funding rounds, infrastructure investments, etc.).

## Components

- `model/`: Data models for funding and infrastructure events.
- `policy/`: Governance rules for market intel ingestion (provenance, licensing).

## Governance

All market intel must be sourced from publicly accessible citations. Restricted/paywalled content is not stored in this repository.
Refer to `policy/policy.md` for detailed rules.
