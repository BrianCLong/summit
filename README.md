**Summit is the undeniable operating system for verifiable, agent-driven open-source intelligence (OSINT) and complex investigations.**
Designed for Enterprise Intelligence, SOC Teams, Government, Defense, and Legal researchers, Summit transforms opaque, ad-hoc research into a mathematically provable, automated science. By replacing manual analytical toil with an immutable chain-of-custody, Summit empowers investigators to uncover truth rapidly with audit-grade AI orchestration.

### 🎯 Key Product Vision & Strategy
* **Provable Intelligence:** Differentiates through deterministic, verifiable chain-of-custody. Every alert and risk score is explainable down to the captured raw artifacts.
* **Code-Enforced Governance:** Strict policies enforced at the tool adapter level, turning unstructured scraping into reproducible, compliant casework.
* **Deterministic Replay:** The ability to rerun an investigation byte-for-byte, proving exactly how a conclusion was reached.

For detailed product strategy, see [Product Vision](docs/product/vision.md) and [Product Roadmap](docs/product/roadmap.md).

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 Agentic AI**: Multi-agent orchestration for autonomous research
- **🕸 Knowledge Graphs**: Neo4j + GraphRAG for connected intelligence
- **📡 Real-time Ingest**: Streaming connectors for CSV, S3, REST APIs
- **🔍 Vector Search**: Semantic retrieval with embeddings
- **📈 CompanyOS SDK**: Enterprise intelligence APIs
- **🔒 Security Hardened**: Production-ready CORS, Helmet, observability

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Neo4j 5.x (via Docker)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/BrianCLong/summit.git
cd summit

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start infrastructure (Neo4j, Postgres, Redis)
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:4000`

### 🌟 Golden Path (Recommended)

For a deterministic and clean bring-up of the local development environment:

```bash
# Automates: make clean -> make bootstrap -> make up
./scripts/golden-path.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
make clean      # Clean build artifacts and docker system
make bootstrap  # Install Python venv and Node dependencies
make up         # Start all services via Docker Compose
```

Refer to [Golden Path Troubleshooting](docs/dev/golden-path-troubleshooting.md) for common issues (like Docker rate limits).

### First Query

```bash
# GraphQL playground
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ health { status version } }"}'

# Or use the web UI
open http://localhost:3000
```

## 🏛 Architecture

Summit follows a modular microservices architecture:

## 🧩 Core Components

- **IntelGraph**: Central graph data model for entities, relationships, evidence, and provenance to enable link analysis and multi-hop queries.
- **Maestro Conductor**: Workflow orchestration for job DAGs, retries, policy enforcement, observability, and SLO tracking, driven by IntelGraph state.
- **CompanyOS**: Knowledge, runbooks, and business logic APIs integrated with graph data and orchestrated workflows.
- **Switchboard**: Ingestion, normalization, deduplication, enrichment, and routing of events into the platform’s core services.
- **Provenance Ledger**: Evidence-first audit trail for explainable outputs, lineage, and compliance-ready reporting across the platform.

- **Neo4j/Postgres**: Database replication
- **Webhooks**: Real-time event streaming

See: [Connector Documentation](docs/connectors/README.md)

### GraphRAG

Retrieval-augmented generation with knowledge graphs:

- Entity extraction & linking
- Multi-hop graph traversal
- Vector similarity search
- LLM-powered synthesis

See: [GraphRAG Guide](docs/graphrag/README.md)

### Agents

Autonomous AI agents for research and analysis:

- **Jules**: PR reviewer, code analyzer
- **Codex**: Task brief generator
- **Observer**: Telemetry and monitoring

See: [Agent Development](docs/agents/README.md)

## 📡 API Reference
