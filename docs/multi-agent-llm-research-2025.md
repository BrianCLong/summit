# Multi-Agent LLM Research & Frameworks (2025)

This guide summarizes leading multi-agent large language model (LLM) research papers, production-ready frameworks, and demo resources that shipped with reproducible code in 2025. Use it as a launchpad for prototyping or benchmarking complex, role-based AI agent systems.

## 1. Multi-Agent LLM Overview

Recent work highlights how specialized language model agents collaborate through clearly defined roles—such as data gathering, analytical reasoning, and strategic planning—to improve accuracy, efficiency, and long-context handling. Public demos frequently showcase travel planning assistants that coordinate flight, lodging, transportation, and activity agents to deliver cohesive itineraries end-to-end.

- **Highlights:** Context-aware browsing, iterative synthesis, and multi-modal result aggregation.
- **Demo Assets:** Ready-to-deploy React, Gradio, and CLI interfaces.

### Haystack
- **Focus:** Production-grade semantic search and question answering with agentic retrieval pipelines.
- **Highlights:** Strong documentation, enterprise reliability, and hybrid search strategies.
- **Demo Assets:** GitHub samples demonstrating multi-hop retrieval and workflow automation.

## 3. Conferences and Demo Platforms

Flagship conferences—including AAMAS 2025 and AAAI 2025—featured live demos of multi-agent systems with open-source repositories and interactive frontends. Featured projects spanned web-based chat orchestration, process automation suites, and robotics integrations, each emphasizing reproducible code and deployment instructions.
