# Assessor Walkthrough Script (5-Minute Screencast)

**(Assumes you are sharing your screen and narrating the actions)**

### 1. Opening (30 seconds)

"Hello, and welcome to the Summit General Availability readiness review. My name is Jules, and I'll be guiding you through the evidence pack. Summit is a production-grade intelligence analysis platform. This review pack is a curated, evidence-based snapshot of our readiness for a GA release. It's designed to demonstrate that our release process is governed by deterministic controls, is fully auditable, and has well-defined procedures for handling failures."

### 2. Repo & GA Readiness Index (60–90 seconds)

"We're starting here, at the root of the Summit repository. All of our GA readiness artifacts are centralized in the `docs` directory.

I'm opening `docs/releases/GA_READINESS_INDEX.md`. This is the canonical starting point for any release readiness review. You can see it clearly states the current eligibility criteria for a GA release. It also serves as an index, pointing to the key workflows and runbooks. For example, here are direct links to the GA verification workflow, the release cut process, and the runbooks for rollback and incident response. This document is your map for the entire process."

### 3. Evidence Bundle Tour (2–3 minutes)

"Now, let's look at the evidence itself. Release evidence is packaged into a downloadable bundle, typically a `.zip` file, generated by our CI pipeline. I have a recent one downloaded and unzipped here.

The first thing to notice is the `MANIFEST.json`. This file lists every artifact included in the bundle, from compliance snapshots to test reports. For integrity, we also have a `SHA256SUMS` file, so you can verify that no artifacts were tampered with after generation.

Next, the `decision.json` file is critical. It contains the explicit 'GO' or 'NO-GO' decision for the release, signed off by the required stakeholders.

The most important file for tracing evidence is the `EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`. This document maps every single control in our governance framework to the exact piece of evidence in this bundle that proves the control is met. For example, if you want to verify our static analysis control, you can find the entry here and click the link to see the raw `semgrep-report.json`."

### 4. Assessor Review Flow (1–2 minutes)

"To make this process as efficient as possible, we've created a guided review plan. I'm now opening the `ASSESSOR_QUICK_START.md` file, which is also in this review pack.

This document lays out a 60-minute 'golden path' review. It starts with the highest-level question—'Are we ready for GA?'—and walks you through answering it by looking at specific artifacts. It gives you a series of steps, what to open, what question to answer, and what 'good' looks like. This allows you to sample the evidence in a structured way, starting from the top down. It also clearly defines what is in scope for this review and what isn't. We recommend you start here to structure your assessment and capture any findings."

### 5. Closing (30 seconds)

"Finally, it's important to know that this entire pack is reproducible. The same `pnpm release:bundle` command that our CI uses can be run locally to regenerate this exact set of artifacts from a specific commit.

If you have questions or identify areas that need remediation, please open an issue in the GitHub repository and reference the specific artifacts or controls from this review. Thank you for your time."
