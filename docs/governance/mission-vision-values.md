## Mission

Deliver agent-first intelligence that **elevates every human contributor**, pairing accountable people with autonomous agent squads so enterprises can scale impact without sacrificing trust, safety, or employment stability.

## Vision

Become the most trusted enterprise automation partner by proving that **governed agent teams create sustainable human leverage**—measured by productivity, career growth, and zero involuntary reductions due to automation.

## Values

1. **Human Amplification First** – Every automation initiative must expand the capacity, capability, or career trajectory of the people it touches.
2. **Provable Governance** – Transparency, disclosure packs, and auditability are non-negotiable prerequisites for every agent deployment.
3. **Mutual Accountability** – Agents operate with policy guardrails; humans retain mission ownership and escalation authority.
4. **Evidence Over Claims** – Outcomes are validated with shared metrics, disclosure artifacts, and customer attestations.
5. **People-Positive Economics** – Automation savings are reinvested into upskilling, tooling, and new opportunities for the teams we serve.

## Operating Guardrails

- **Linkage to Policy:** All positioning and marketing assets must align with the [Agent-First Positioning Policy](../policy/agent-first-positioning-policy.md).
- **Governance Alignment:** Disclosures, audit trails, and policy labels follow the standards defined in the [Documentation Governance Charter](documentation-charter.md) and [COMPLIANCE guide](../COMPLIANCE.md).
- **Mission Integrity:** Any initiative that conflicts with the employment pledge or introduces workforce risk triggers an immediate executive review.

## How This Informs Go-To-Market

- **Messaging:** Every asset emphasizes partnership between agents and humans, referencing the employment pledge and disclosure-first governance.
- **Product Proof:** Collateral links to measurable evidence (e.g., Maestro run IDs, IntelGraph dashboards) that show uplift without layoffs.
- **Customer Success:** Engagement plans include reskilling budgets, learning pathways, and quarterly attestations documented in governance logs.
