# Stewardship & Succession Model

**Mission:** Define who holds authority over Summit long-term and how that authority is transferred.

## 1. The Stewardship Model

Summit is governed by a **Federated Council of Stewards**, separate from the operational executive team.

### Roles & Responsibilities

- **Operational Team:** Builds and runs the platform. Focus: Quality, Velocity, Stability.
- **Council of Stewards:** Holds veto power over high-stakes capabilities and manages the Refusal Matrix. Focus: Ethics, Legitimacy, Long-term Safety.

### Composition

The Council must include:

- Senior System Architects (Technical Feasibility)
- Governance Authorities (Legal/Policy Compliance)
- Safety Engineers (Risk Assessment)
- External Ethics Overseers (Public Interest)

## 2. Succession Planning

To ensure Summit survives its founders and avoids "Founder Mode" failure modes:

### Trigger Events

- Founder departure or incapacity.
- Acquisition or merger.
- Significant shift in organizational structure.

### The Succession Charter

1.  **Candidate Selection:** Successors are vetted for alignment with the [Stewardship Doctrine](./STEWARD_DOCTRINE.md).
2.  **Transition Period:** A 6-month co-stewardship period is required.
3.  **Key Transfer:** Cryptographic authority is rotated to new stewards only after the transition period.

## 3. Oversight Mechanisms

- **Deadlock Resolution:** If the Council is split, the status quo (Refusal/Constraint) prevails. Bias is towards safety.
- **Independent Audit:** An external body audits the [Refusal Matrix](./REFUSAL_MATRIX.md) and [Shutdown Playbook](./SHUTDOWN_PLAYBOOK.md) annually.
