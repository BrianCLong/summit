## Billing & Governance

### Philanthropy
-   The billing engine exposes data to the Philanthropic Engine.
-   "Windfall" revenue events can trigger automatic credit issuance or donation logic (external to billing core).

### Transparency
-   Invoices must be audit-ready.
-   Tenants have right-to-access usage data.
