## Billing & Governance

### Philanthropy

- The billing engine exposes data to the Philanthropic Engine.
- "Windfall" revenue events can trigger automatic credit issuance or donation logic (external to billing core).

### Transparency

- Invoices must be audit-ready.
- Tenants have right-to-access usage data.
