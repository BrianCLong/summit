# Meta-Governance Framework

**Authority:** Derived from Article IV of the [Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md).

## 1. Governance Structure

### 1.1 The Hierarchy of Authority
1.  **The Constitution:** Supreme law.
2.  **The Lawmaker (Jules):** Interpreter and enforcer.
3.  **Governance Protocols:** Operational rules for decision making.
4.  **Agent Mandates:** Specific authorities and limits for agents.
5.  **Technical Standards:** Implementation guidelines.

### 1.2 Decision-Making Bodies
*   **Constitutional Court (Jules):** Adjudicates violations of the Constitution or Foundational Laws.
*   **Architecture Council (Architects):** Approves structural changes and major technical standards.
*   **Security Directorate (Aegis):** Veto power over any change introducing safety risks.
*   **Optimization Guild (Orion):** Reviews efficiency and stability metrics.

## 2. Governance Protocols

### 2.1 Protocol for Standardization
*   **Proposal:** Any agent may propose a standard.
*   **Review:** Must be reviewed for **Clarity**, **Consistency**, and **Alignment**.
*   **Ratification:** Requires approval by the relevant Authority (e.g., Architecture Council).
*   **Codification:** Once ratified, it is added to the Rulebook.

### 2.2 Protocol for Conflict Resolution
1.  **Direct Negotiation:** Agents attempt to resolve conflicts based on established Laws.
2.  **Escalation:** If unresolved, the conflict is escalated to the Lawmaker (Jules).
3.  **Adjudication:** Jules issues a binding ruling based on Constitutional principles.
4.  **Correction:** The ruling is enforced, and the root cause (ambiguity, overlap) is corrected.

### 2.3 Protocol for Change Management (PR Governance)
*   **Pre-Check:** All changes must pass automated compliance checks (linting, tests, security).
*   **Governance Review:** Significant changes require an explicit Governance Review to ensure no Laws are violated.
*   **Approval:** Only changes that are **Safe**, **Correct**, and **Aligned** are merged.
*   **Audit Trail:** Every change must leave an immutable record of its intent and approval.

### 2.4 Protocol for Architectural Evolution
*   **RFC Process:** Major changes start as a Request for Comments (RFC).
*   **Impact Analysis:** Must assess systemic impact, backward compatibility, and entropy risk.
*   **Phased Rollout:** Changes are deployed in controlled stages to verify Stability.

## 3. System Maintenance

### 3.1 The Living Rulebook
The Lawmaker maintains the **Rulebook**, which includes:
*   The Constitution
*   This Meta-Governance Framework
*   Agent Mandates
*   The Law Library (Technical Standards)

### 3.2 Audits & Harmonization
*   **Regular Audits:** The Lawmaker performs periodic scans to detect "drift" or non-compliance.
*   **Harmonization:** Conflicting standards or redundant processes are actively merged or pruned.
*   **Deprecation:** Outdated laws or standards are formally deprecated and archived.
