## Epic 5 — Stability at Scale (make growth safe)

1. Build multi-tenant fairness controls for all expensive operations.
2. Implement tenant-level quotas/limits aligned to packaging and margin.
3. Add overload/brownout modes for noncritical features.
4. Optimize top cost/latency drivers with evidence (queries, caches, batch).
5. Implement performance regression tests for Tier-0 journeys and new workflows.
6. Run quarterly scale tests (load + failure) and ship findings.
7. Improve dependency resilience: fallbacks, caches, graceful degradation.
8. Track unit cost per core action and enforce regression gates.
9. Reduce incident recurrence with “top 10 causes” burn-down.
10. Improve on-call health via automation and alert hygiene.
11. Delete unbounded retries, unbounded queues, and unbounded exports.
