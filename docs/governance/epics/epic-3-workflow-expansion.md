## Epic 3 — Workflow Expansion Beyond MVP3 (new value without new chaos)

1. Identify top 3 post-GA workflows from the wishbooks (highest impact + evidence).
2. Define end-to-end acceptance criteria (journey complete, recoverable, supportable).
3. Build thin vertical slices that unlock partial value weekly.
4. Add governance controls as you go (roles, audit, limits) so enterprise adoption follows.
5. Instrument new workflows with funnels and outcome metrics at launch.
6. Implement templates and defaults to reduce setup burden.
7. Ensure portability: export packs for new objects and actions.
8. Provide API/webhook coverage for new workflows if promised.
9. Run usability tests before broad rollout; ship fixes fast.
10. Add deprecation plan for any old flow replaced by the new one.
11. Delete “half-workflows” that create tickets and churn.
