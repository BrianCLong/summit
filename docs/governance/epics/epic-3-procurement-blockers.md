# Epic 3 — GA Procurement Blockers Killer List (ship what closes enterprise deals)

1.  Build a ranked list of procurement blockers from real deals (security, legal, IT).
2.  Ship Trust Pack v1: security overview, IR policy, subprocessors, uptime posture.
3.  Add admin exports: audit logs export + retention settings evidence.
4.  Implement SSO baseline and tighten admin MFA/session policies.
5.  Provide IP allowlisting or conditional access if it’s a recurring blocker.
6.  Add “evidence packs” generator: screenshots/config exports + signed attestations.
7.  Create a questionnaire deflection knowledge base (approved answers + links).
8.  Build “security review mode” docs: architecture diagram, data flow, controls mapping.
9.  Instrument “time stuck in procurement” and reduce systematically.
10. Add a fast-lane for deals on standard posture (no bespoke promises).
11. Delete any marketing/security claims you can’t evidence.
