## Epic 8 — “Full Council” Big Bets Program (3 bets, not 30 wishes)

1. Select 3 cross-council big bets for the next half (with explicit kill criteria).
2. Form tiger teams with single-threaded owners and protected capacity.
3. Write one-page “bet briefs”: problem, users, success metrics, risks, sequence.
4. Build dependency map and lock prerequisites before feature sprawl.
5. Ship a thin “beta slice” in 4–6 weeks for each bet.
6. Establish weekly bet review cadence (metrics + risks, not status).
7. Create a comms plan: internal updates + customer pilot updates.
8. Decide at each checkpoint: expand, pivot, or kill—no limbo.
9. Capture learnings into platform primitives and patterns.
10. Publish a quarterly “bets report” with results and decisions.
11. Delete big bets that don’t move metrics by the checkpoint.
