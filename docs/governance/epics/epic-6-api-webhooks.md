# Epic 6 — API/Webhooks GA+ (developer surface that doesn’t embarrass you)

1.  Lock GA API surface: endpoints, scopes, rate limits, error contracts.
2.  Publish OpenAPI and enforce contract tests in CI.
3.  Implement signed webhooks with retries, idempotency, and replay UI.
4.  Add per-tenant API/webhook health dashboards (deliverability, failures, latency).
5.  Create sandbox tenants with seeded data and reset buttons.
6.  Implement versioning + deprecation policy with a real calendar.
7.  Build SDK/codegen pipeline to prevent drift (release aligned).
8.  Add “integration runbooks” and common recipes in docs.
9.  Implement abuse controls: burst limits, anomaly detection, credential rotation.
10. Build partner certification tests (they pass before you endorse).
11. Delete undocumented endpoints and “special partner” hooks.
