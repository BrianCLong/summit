3. Add granular audit logs with export and SIEM integration options.
4. Implement retention policies per org/workspace with deletion verification.
5. Add policy templates (data access, exports, approvals) for common enterprise needs.
6. Build org-level dashboards: usage, limits, integrations health, security posture.
7. Implement delegated admin roles and approval workflows for sensitive actions.
8. Add org-level change control: feature toggles, release tracks, freezes.
9. Provide “regulated mode” defaults where needed (stricter posture).
10. Create admin onboarding wizard + readiness checklist.
11. Delete bespoke enterprise controls by converging to productized policies.
