# Epic 9 — Wishbook-to-Roadmap Execution Kernel (beyond GA, no sprawl)

1.  Build a single backlog view: wishbook items tagged to workflows and metrics.
2.  Re-score using post-GA telemetry (activation, SLOs, cost, ticket drivers).
3.  Select 3 cross-council “big bets” for the next half with kill criteria.
4.  Sequence prerequisites first (platform primitives) and freeze drift.
5.  Convert big bets into thin weekly slices with verification steps.
6.  Create a trade-off ledger: new scope requires explicit de-scope.
7.  Maintain a “commitments register” (sales promises, pilots, deadlines) with owners.
8.  Run weekly council readout: shipped, killed, metrics moved, next decisions.
9.  Enforce deletion quota alongside new work (services, flags, endpoints, UX drift).
10. Publish a monthly “portfolio memo” internally: truth + actions + next targets.
11. Delete wishbook items with no owner, no metric, or no customer evidence.
