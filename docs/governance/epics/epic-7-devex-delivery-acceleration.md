## Epic 7 — DevEx & Delivery Acceleration (ship more, break less)

1. Reduce CI time by killing flake and parallelizing critical suites.
2. Implement one-command local dev + seeded test data.
3. Provide shared libs for retries/timeouts/logging/auth (golden path adoption).
4. Build codemods for common migrations (framework upgrades, component updates).
5. Standardize release tooling: canary, ramp, rollback, verification tests.
6. Implement preview environments with TTL and safe data.
7. Improve code review throughput: PR size norms and review SLAs.
8. Track cycle time and blocked time; remove top friction quarterly.
9. Create internal “how-to” playbooks for common changes (jobs, events, schema).
10. Run quarterly DevEx retro and ship 3 concrete improvements.
11. Delete bespoke pipelines and snowflake repo conventions.
