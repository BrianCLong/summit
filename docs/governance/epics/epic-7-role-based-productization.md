# Epic 7 — Role-Based Productization (enterprise controls without bespoke code)

1.  Define role templates (admin, auditor, operator, viewer, support) with least privilege.
2.  Implement delegated admin and approval workflows for sensitive actions.
3.  Add policy templates (exports, retention, integrations, org settings) with defaults.
4.  Build org-level change controls (feature toggles, release tracks, freezes).
5.  Implement tenant-level quotas aligned to packaging and safety.
6.  Provide audit log filtering/search and export formats for SIEM ingestion.
7.  Add “access review” reports for admins (who has what, last used).
8.  Build a “rollout wizard” for org-wide deployment (invite, policies, checks).
9.  Instrument governance feature adoption as expansion leading indicators.
10. Create a regulated-mode configuration profile (stricter defaults).
11. Delete bespoke enterprise knobs by converging to templates.
