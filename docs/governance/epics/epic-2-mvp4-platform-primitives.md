## Epic 2 — MVP4 Platform Primitives (make the next wave cheap to build)

1. Finalize canonical object model for MVP4 (users, orgs, entitlements, artifacts, events).
2. Build/upgrade entitlements service to support upcoming modules cleanly.
3. Implement event schema registry and compatibility enforcement.
4. Add idempotency + outbox patterns to critical write paths.
5. Standardize auth scopes for internal and external APIs.
6. Provide a service template (“golden path”) with observability/security baked in.
7. Implement migration tooling for legacy patterns (dual-run + cutover).
8. Build internal developer portal/service catalog with ownership and SLOs.
9. Establish platform SLOs and on-call ownership.
10. Run quarterly platform deletion (retire one legacy primitive each cycle).
11. Delete “platform as an idea”—make it a shipped interface with contracts.
