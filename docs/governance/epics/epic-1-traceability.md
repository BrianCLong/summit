## Epic 1 — “Council to Code” Traceability (every wish becomes a shipped artifact or a corpse)

1. Assign each wishbook item a permanent ID and owner.
2. Link IDs to epics, PRDs, RFCs, tickets, and commits (bidirectional).
3. Build a traceability dashboard: wish → epic → shipped → metric movement.
4. Require “ship note” per item: what shipped, where, how to verify, what changed.
5. Require “kill note” per killed item: why, what replaced it, what assumption failed.
6. Add automated status sync from issue tracker to the wishbook index.
7. Implement “no orphan work” rule: no code without an epic ID on Tier-0 repos.
8. Add audit logs for scope changes (who changed what, when, why).
9. Publish weekly “traceability report” to councils and execs.
10. Run quarterly traceability audit and close gaps.
11. Delete untraceable work from roadmap credit.
