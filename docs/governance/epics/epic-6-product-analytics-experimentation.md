## Epic 6 — Product Analytics & Experimentation Platform (stop guessing)

1. Define canonical event taxonomy and schema governance.
2. Implement experiment framework (assignment, exposure logging, guardrails).
3. Build funnel dashboards for activation and new workflows (self-serve).
4. Add feature adoption tracking tied to roles and segments.
5. Implement cohort analysis and retention curves in one place.
6. Add anomaly detection for metrics (adoption spikes/drops, errors, cost).
7. Create “launch measurement checklist” and enforce it.
8. Train PMs/Eng on experimentation ethics and statistical basics.
9. Run monthly “metrics integrity” audits and fix drift.
10. Tie roadmap decisions to measured outcomes and publish learnings.
11. Delete experiments that can’t be measured or would harm trust.
