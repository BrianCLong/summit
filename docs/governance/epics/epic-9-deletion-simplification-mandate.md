## Epic 9 — Deletion & Simplification Mandate (the only way “beyond” works)

1. Set quarterly deletion targets: services, endpoints, flags, UI patterns, vendors.
2. Create a deprecation calendar with tooling and customer comms.
3. Require every new capability to name what it replaces (or justify net-new).
4. Implement “dual-run maximum window” policy with forced cutover dates.
5. Track complexity metrics: service count, dependency edges, config knobs, build time.
6. Reward teams for deletion and simplification (OKRs and recognition).
7. Run monthly architecture deletion review and publish results.
8. Kill unused features based on telemetry (not sentiment).
9. Remove legacy data pipelines and orphan datasets quarterly.
10. Reduce configuration surface area with templates and “boring defaults.”
11. Institutionalize the rule: **if you don’t delete, you don’t scale.**
