# Epic 1: AI Usage Inventory & Policy Baseline (stop shadow AI)

1.  Inventory every AI use: internal tools, customer-facing features, vendor AI, employee copilots.
2.  Classify use cases by risk: low (drafting), medium (recommendations), high (decisions/eligibility).
3.  Publish an AI acceptable use policy (what’s allowed, prohibited, approval needed).
4.  Define data rules: what can be sent to AI tools, what cannot (PII, secrets, customer data).
5.  Implement an “approved AI tools” list with SSO and logging requirements.
6.  Create AI exceptions registry with expirations (no permanent shadow tools).
7.  Train staff on safe AI usage and prompt hygiene.
8.  Implement DLP blocks for restricted data into unapproved AI endpoints.
9.  Build an AI incident playbook (leak, bias claim, hallucination harm).
10. Establish AI governance council (Legal/Security/Product) with decision SLAs.
11. Delete unapproved AI tools and remove API keys from personal accounts.
