# Epic 4: Customer-Facing Disclosure & Claims Discipline (don’t create liability)

1.  Define what you will disclose: AI is used, limitations, expected behavior, escalation path.
2.  Create AI UX patterns: confidence cues, citations, “check this” warnings where appropriate.
3.  Publish acceptable use and prohibited use for AI features.
4.  Align marketing claims to measured performance; keep evidence packs.
5.  Add “no reliance” language where appropriate (bounded, enforceable).
6.  Implement incident reporting channel for AI harm and misuse.
7.  Create complaint handling workflow and rapid remediation playbook.
8.  Provide customers with controls: opt-outs, logging, policy settings.
9.  Maintain change log for model behavior and major updates.
10. Train Sales/CS on AI talk tracks and forbidden promises.
11. Delete AI superlatives (“perfect,” “guaranteed”) from public surfaces.
