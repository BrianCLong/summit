# Epic 2: Data Governance for AI (rights, provenance, and minimization)

1.  Define what data can be used for training/fine-tuning (and who approves).
2.  Implement dataset provenance tracking (source, license/rights, consent, retention).
3.  Build “training data contracts” and approval workflow (internal + vendor).
4.  Tag data with purpose and restrictions; enforce in pipelines.
5.  Implement anonymization/pseudonymization where feasible for AI pipelines.
6.  Build opt-out controls for customers where applicable (contract-aligned).
7.  Restrict model prompts/logs storage and apply retention rules.
8.  Prevent secrets/PII from entering prompts via redaction and guardrails.
9.  Maintain subprocessor disclosures for AI vendors and model providers.
10. Run quarterly audits of AI datasets and usage logs.
11. Delete datasets with unclear rights or unnecessary sensitivity.
