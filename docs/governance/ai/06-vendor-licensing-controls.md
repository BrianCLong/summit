# Epic 6: Vendor & Licensing Controls for AI (don’t donate your crown jewels)

1.  Review vendor AI terms: training on your data, retention, confidentiality, subprocessors.
2.  Negotiate “no training on customer data” by default (or make it opt-in with compensation).
3.  Implement contractual and technical controls for data sent to vendors (minimize).
4.  Maintain model/provider inventory with risk tier and contract posture.
5.  Build exit plans: portability, model swap, data deletion attestations.
6.  Ensure IP ownership for outputs and derived works is defined in contracts.
7.  Monitor vendor model changes and deprecations; plan migrations early.
8.  Implement procurement gate for AI vendors (Security + Legal required).
9.  Maintain a license compliance program for AI datasets and weights (if applicable).
10. Track vendor incidents and enforce notification/response SLAs.
11. Delete “free tier” vendor usage that bypasses enterprise terms.
