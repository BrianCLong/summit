# Epic 9: AI Governance & Board Visibility (treat AI as enterprise risk)

1.  Establish AI governance council with a charter and decision SLAs.
2.  Maintain AI risk register: data rights, hallucination harm, bias, security, vendor lock-in.
3.  Track KPIs: model performance, complaint rates, refusals, incidents, cost per action.
4.  Publish monthly internal AI memo: what shipped, what changed, what broke, what’s next.
5.  Enforce exceptions registry expirations (shadow AI dies quickly).
6.  Maintain training completion and policy acknowledgment tracking.
7.  Keep board appendix for high-risk AI features and material incidents.
8.  Run annual AI tabletop: model failure + media + regulator + customer harm.
9.  Tie roadmap capacity to AI risk mitigation work (not optional).
10. Audit AI posture quarterly (controls, contracts, datasets, logs).
11. Institutionalize the rule: **AI is a product surface and a liability surface—govern it.**
