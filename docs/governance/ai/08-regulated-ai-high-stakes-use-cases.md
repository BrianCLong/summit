# Epic 8: Regulated AI & High-Stakes Use Cases (compliance by design)

1.  Identify regulated/high-stakes categories (employment, credit, health, education, legal).
2.  Prohibit high-stakes decisions without explicit governance and human review.
3.  Implement documentation: purpose, risks, mitigations, evaluation results.
4.  Provide explainability artifacts where required (inputs, rationale, limits).
5.  Implement bias testing and disparate impact monitoring where applicable.
6.  Establish customer contract clauses for AI use and responsibilities.
7.  Maintain audit logs suitable for regulators (scoped, privacy-safe).
8.  Run quarterly compliance reviews for high-risk AI features.
9.  Create incident notification matrices for AI-related harms.
10. Train teams on regulated AI constraints and escalation.
11. Delete ambiguous “AI decides” features that cross into regulated territory.
