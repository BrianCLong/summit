# Competitive Positioning: Narrative IO Inference & Convergence

## Positioning
- Many systems detect **keywords/claims**; Summit adds **implicit-default + structural redundancy + long-horizon identity** detection.
- **Constraint:** Summit claims **detection support**, not intent proof.

## Differentiation
- **Interpretive Defaults:** Extracts what is *presupposed*, not just what is said.
- **Structural Redundancy:** Detects same logic in different words (e.g., metaphors).
- **Identity Tracking:** Tracks narrative evolution over time (mutations).
