# Summit Stewardship Doctrine

> **PRIME DIRECTIVE**
>
> Summit is not merely infrastructure; it is **stewarded power**.
> We affirm our right to refuse, constrain, sunset, or shut down capabilities—even when profitable, demanded, or politically pressured.
> Nothing ships unless it strengthens our ethical credibility and institutional trust.

## 1. Authority & Legitimacy

This doctrine establishes the **final authority layer** for the Summit platform. It supersedes commercial contracts and short-term operational goals. The legitimacy of Summit depends on its ability to say "no" decisively.

## 2. Strategic Objectives

### Objective A — Refusal & Non-Participation

**"What Summit will not do, even if asked."**
We maintain a [Refusal Matrix](./REFUSAL_MATRIX.md) defining explicit non-goals and prohibited uses (e.g., coercive population control, autonomous lethal decision-making).

### Objective B — Graduated Constraint

**"How power is reduced safely before harm occurs."**
We employ a graduated constraint ladder to throttle scope, fidelity, and automation levels under stress or uncertainty.

### Objective C — Ethical Shutdown

**"How Summit ends without chaos or capture."**
We maintain a [Shutdown Playbook](./SHUTDOWN_PLAYBOOK.md) to ensure safe, orderly end-of-life procedures that prevent data loss or hostile capture.

### Objective D — Stewardship Succession

**"Who holds responsibility when creators step back."**
We define a [Stewardship Model](./STEWARD_MODEL.md) to transfer authority to a trust, foundation, or public-benefit entity, ensuring long-term alignment.

## 3. Execution Guardrails

- ❌ **No silent refusal:** Decisions must be logged.
- ❌ **No irreversible power:** Capabilities must be constrainable.
- ❌ **No ambiguity:** Authority must be clear.
- ❌ **No ethics theater:** Policies must be enforced by code (`server/src/config/stewardship.ts`, `policy/stewardship.rego`).

## 4. Stop Condition

We consider this doctrine active when Summit can safely:

1.  **Say No** (Refusal)
2.  **Slow Down** (Constraint)
3.  **End** (Shutdown)
4.  **Transfer** (Stewardship)
