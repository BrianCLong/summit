# Evidence Map
# Contract:
# - Every Evidence ID emitted into evidence/ga-evidence-manifest.json MUST be registered here
#   either as an exact `evidence[].id` entry OR matched by `patterns[]`.
# - Patterns support '*' wildcard only (glob-style).

schemaVersion: "1.0"

patterns:
  # Allow whole classes of verify artifacts without enumerating each output file
  - "EV-VERIFY-*"
  # Allow subject artifacts with varying hashes
  - "EV-SUBJECT-*"

evidence:
  # Subjects are typically stable and should be explicit (recommended).
  # However, to avoid churn when subject digests change, we use patterns above.
  # Exact IDs can be added here if strict control is needed for specific items.
