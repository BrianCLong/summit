# Executive Readout: 2026 Regulatory Landscape
**Date:** January 25, 2026
**To:** Summit Leadership / Board
**From:** Regulatory Intelligence Lead

## 1. What Changed in the Regulatory Landscape
The "Wait and See" era is over. 2026 brings enforcement-heavy regimes with direct impact on Summit's architecture and go-to-market.

*   **EU AI Act (Aug 2026):** Transitioned from "Transparency" to **"High-Risk" obligations** for systems influencing democratic processes or critical infrastructure. This impacts our Narrative Engine.
*   **GDPR (Jan 2026):** Enforcement is now "Harmonized" across borders. The "One-Stop-Shop" is faster, and "Urgent Procedures" (24h response) are live.
*   **FedRAMP (20x):** Shift to **Machine-Readable Evidence (OSCAL)**. "Paper-based" compliance is becoming a competitive disadvantage.
*   **Defense (CMMC 2.0):** Encryption is no longer a "Get out of Jail Free" card. If we hold keys, we are in scope.

## 2. What Summit Already Covers
Our "Governance-First" architecture provides a strong defensive moat:
*   ✅ **Provenance Ledger:** Solves the "Right to Explanation" and data lineage requirements.
*   ✅ **Litellm Gateway:** Already supports region-pinning for Data Sovereignty.
*   ✅ **Policy-as-Code:** Our OPA infrastructure is ready to ingest new regulatory constraints.

## 3. What Must Be Done Before GA (Blockers)
To sell into Regulated Enterprise and Government by Q3 2026, we must:
1.  **Reclassify Narrative Engine:** Formally treat it as "High-Risk AI" and implement the required Risk Management System (Art 9).
2.  **Define CUI Enclave:** Explicitly architect a "Defense Edition" that isolates CUI, acknowledging that our standard SaaS encryption is insufficient for CMMC L2.
3.  **Operationalize Cross-Border Response:** Document the "Break-Glass" workflow for urgent DPA inquiries.

## 4. What Is Safe to Defer
*   **Full OSCAL Automation:** We can launch with manual artifacts (Rev5 SSP) and build the JSON exporter post-GA (P2).
*   **Remote Access Transfer Impact Assessments (TIA):** We can rely on standard clauses for launch, provided we restrict production access severely.

## 5. Strategic Recommendation
**Treat Compliance as a Product Feature.**
By automating the "High-Risk" controls (Systemic Risk Assessment, Provenance), Summit can sell "Safety" to buyers who are terrified of the EU AI Act penalties (up to 7% of turnover). We should market our **Provenance Ledger** as a "Regulatory Shield."
