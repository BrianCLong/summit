# Epic 1 — Board Narrative Architecture (make governance a weapon)

1.  **Define the 3 board narratives**: growth, risk, and execution (one page each).
2.  **Establish board decision cadence**: what decisions happen when, and what inputs they require.
3.  **Create a board “metrics constitution”**: (10–15 canonical metrics, definitions locked).
4.  **Implement a board memo template**: context → decision → risks → asks → next steps.
5.  **Build a board action log with owners and due dates**: (no forgotten commitments).
6.  **Create a standing “risk register” appendix**: (top 10 risks, mitigations, dates).
7.  **Define what triggers out-of-cycle board updates**: (incidents, investigations, liquidity).
8.  **Align committee charters (audit/comp/risk) to actual work and reporting.**
9.  **Institute pre-reads 5–7 days before meetings**: (no meeting-by-surprise).
10. **Train execs on board communication discipline**: (short, factual, decision-oriented).
11. **Delete slide-deck theater; prioritize crisp memos with evidence.**
