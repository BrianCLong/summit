4.  **Keep committee minutes and approvals complete and organized.**
5.  **Establish delegated authority matrix and enforce it.**
6.  **Implement disclosure controls for material events** (who decides materiality).
7.  **Standardize insider trading compliance** (windows, 10b5-1 if relevant, training).
8.  **Maintain cap table accuracy and option plan governance in board materials.**
9.  **Ensure proper approvals for related-party transactions.**
