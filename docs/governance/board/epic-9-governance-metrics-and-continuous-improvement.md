1.  **Track governance KPIs**: board action closure rate, pre-read timeliness, decision latency.
2.  **Measure board pack quality via director feedback** (structured, not informal).
3.  **Maintain evergreen governance calendar** (meetings, audits, comp cycles).
4.  **Audit governance artifacts annually** (minutes completeness, approvals, policies).
5.  **Keep exceptions registry for governance deviations with expirations.**
6.  **Refresh risk register quarterly and measure mitigation progress.**
7.  **Review D&O, cyber, and key policies annually; document changes.**
8.  **Maintain succession planning and executive talent updates to board quarterly.**
9.  **Build board-level transparency into culture**: consistent truth, no spin.
10. **Run annual governance retro with board and exec team.**
11. **Institutionalize the rule: good governance accelerates decisions.**
