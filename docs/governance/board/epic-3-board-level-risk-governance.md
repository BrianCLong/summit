# Epic 3 — Board-Level Risk Governance (risk is a managed portfolio)

1.  **Maintain enterprise risk register with owners, mitigations, ship dates.**
2.  **Define risk appetite statements** (security, compliance, liquidity, concentration).
3.  **Implement risk scoring and quarterly reassessment.**
4.  **Tie risks to controls and evidence** (no “we’re on it”).
5.  **Report incidents and near-misses with prevention shipped and deadlines.**
6.  **Track exceptions/waivers and force expiry** (board-visible).
7.  **Implement third-party/vendor risk reporting** (top vendors, posture, concentration).
8.  **Add regulatory/political risk updates where relevant** (market access threats).
9.  **Run annual board tabletop**: breach + media + regulator + customer churn.
10. **Ensure D&O and cyber insurance posture is reviewed annually.**
11. **Delete “risk as a paragraph” — require measurable posture.**
