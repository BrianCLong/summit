# Epic 2 — Board Pack Production System (reduce scramble, increase truth)

1.  **Centralize board pack source data** (one repo + one metrics layer).
2.  **Automate creation of core charts from canonical metrics** (no hand edits).
3.  **Build a monthly close calendar that feeds board reporting on time.**
4.  **Implement “numbers freeze” policy with change log for late corrections.**
5.  **Add commentary requirements**: every chart gets “what changed/why/what next.”
6.  **Maintain a “board appendix library”** (security, compliance, sales, product).
7.  **Add red/amber/green only where tied to objective thresholds.**
8.  **Implement board pack review workflow**: Finance → Legal → CEO → final.
9.  **Store board materials in a controlled data room with retention rules.**
10. **Run post-meeting retro**: what confused them, what landed, what to improve.
11. **Delete bespoke one-off analyses that aren’t reusable next cycle.**
