# Epic 7 — Board Engagement on Strategy (make them useful, not ornamental)

1.  **Pre-wire major decisions with 1:1s to avoid meeting ambushes.**
2.  **Create board working sessions for key topics** (pricing, M&A, platform, international).
3.  **Use directors as network nodes**: customer intros, hiring, partnerships (logged asks).
4.  **Build a “board help” pipeline**: requests → owners → follow-through.
5.  **Provide competitive landscape updates with evidence and implications.**
6.  **Share product demos focused on outcomes and risk posture.**
7.  **Use scenario planning**: base/upside/downside with actions per scenario.
8.  **Track and report on board-sourced value** (hires, intros, deals).
9.  **Rotate deep dives across functions** (security one quarter, data next, etc.).
10. **Keep discussions grounded in canonical metrics and risk register.**
11. **Delete board time spent on operational trivia.**
