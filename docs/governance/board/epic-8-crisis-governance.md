# Epic 8 — Crisis Governance (when it burns, governance must still work)

1.  **Define crisis triggers that activate board notification protocol.**
2.  **Create a crisis call tree**: CEO, GC, Security, Comms, board chair.
3.  **Build board-ready incident briefing template** (facts, impact, actions, timeline).
4.  **Establish privilege protocol for crisis communications** (preserve work product).
5.  **Maintain a “public statements” discipline and spokesperson rules.**
6.  **Keep a standing outside counsel + forensics bench** (pre-negotiated).
7.  **Run annual crisis tabletop with directors** (breach + regulator + media).
8.  **Track crisis decisions and approvals in a decision log in real time.**
9.  **Post-crisis: deliver prevention plan with dates and accountability.**
10. **Review insurance notifications and coverage posture during crisis.**
11. **Delete improvisational board comms—use the protocol.**
