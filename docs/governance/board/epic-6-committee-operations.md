# Epic 6 — Committee Operations (audit/comp/risk that actually works)

1.  **Define committee charters with clear scope and annual calendars.**
2.  **Build committee-specific dashboards** (audit: controls; comp: talent; risk: top exposures).
3.  **Create briefing templates and pre-reads for each committee meeting.**
4.  **Implement action logs and follow-up cadence per committee.**
5.  **Establish management “owners” per committee topic** (single-threaded).
6.  **Run annual committee self-assessments and refresh charters accordingly.**
7.  **Ensure comp decisions are tied to measurable outcomes and role benchmarks.**
8.  **Maintain whistleblower and investigation reporting to the appropriate committee.**
9.  **Align audit committee reporting with finance close and external audit timelines.**
10. **Track committee decisions and ensure they appear in the minutes.**
11. **Delete committee meetings that don’t produce decisions or actions.**
