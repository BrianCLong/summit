# Epic 5 — Investor Comms & Expectation Management (control the external story)

1.  **Define investor update cadence**: monthly email, quarterly memo, ad hoc triggers.
2.  **Create a standard investor update template** (metrics, narrative, asks).
3.  **Implement a “what we will not disclose” policy** (sensitive ops, customer details).
4.  **Maintain a consistent KPI set across investor comms and board packs.**
5.  **Track investor questions and answer them with a single canonical doc.**
6.  **Create crisis investor comms templates** (incident, lawsuit, exec change).
7.  **Establish who can speak to investors and what requires counsel review.**
8.  **Build an investor data room with versioned artifacts** (same as board hygiene).
9.  **Train execs on forward-looking statements discipline.**
10. **Maintain a fundraising readiness kit** (metrics, story, diligence pack).
11. **Delete fragmented investor narratives across execs—one story only.**
