# Governance & Provenance

Summit is built on the principle that **intelligence requires evidence**. In an era of AI-generated content, trusting the output requires verifying the process.

## Provenance Philosophy

We treat **decision provenance** as a first-class citizen. Every insight, relationship, or conclusion generated by the system (whether by a human or an AI agent) is recorded with:

1. **Who/What**: The agent or user ID.
2. **When**: High-precision timestamp.
3. **Why**: The input data, prompt, or reasoning chain used.
4. **Evidence**: References to source documents or raw data.

## How It Works

### IntelGraph & Maestro

- **IntelGraph** stores the *current state* of the world (Nodes and Edges).
- **Maestro** orchestrates the *workflows* that modify that state.

When Maestro executes a runbook (e.g., "Investigate IP Address"):
1. It creates a trace of every step.
2. Any new data added to the graph is linked back to that trace.
3. Evidence files (screenshots, raw JSON, logs) are stored in **Evidence Directories** and hashed.

### The Provenance Ledger

All critical actions are logged to a tamper-evident **Provenance Ledger**. This ensures:

- **Auditability**: You can replay the decision tree of an investigation.
- **Accountability**: "Human-in-the-loop" gates are cryptographically signed.
- **Reproducibility**: Same inputs + same agents = same results (or at least, explainable deviations).

## Supply Chain Security (SLSA)

Summit applies these same principles to its own delivery:
- **SBOMs**: Software Bill of Materials are generated for every build.
- **SLSA Provenance**: Build artifacts include provenance attestations, ensuring the code you run matches the source code in the repo.

## Key Benefits

- **Defensible Analysis**: Use Summit for legal or compliance-heavy investigations.
- **AI Safety**: Detect hallucinations by verifying the evidence chain.
- **Operational Trust**: Know exactly who changed a configuration or graph element.
