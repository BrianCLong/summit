# Defense Data Handling (CUI & CMMC)
**Status:** Mandatory for Defense/Federal Clients
**Standard:** CMMC 2.0 (Level 2), NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3
**Scope:** Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)

## 1. Executive Summary
Summit requires strict architectural and procedural controls for handling CUI. Compliance with CMMC 2.0 Level 2 is a baseline requirement for all defense-related deployments. **Encryption alone is insufficient.**

## 2. The "Encryption ≠ Compliance" Rule
**Explicit Policy:** Encrypting CUI at rest and in transit does **NOT** exclude a system from CMMC scope if Summit possesses the decryption keys.
*   **Excluded:** Only if Summit processes CUI as fully opaque blobs *without* access to keys (e.g., client-side encryption).
*   **In-Scope:** All normal SaaS processing, indexing, and AI inference.

## 3. CUI Enclave Architecture
Defense data must be isolated in a designated "CUI Enclave" (GovCloud or dedicated instance).

### 3.1 Architectural Requirements
*   **Isolation:** Logical separation from commercial tenants (separate VPC/Subscription).
*   **FIPS Validated Cryptography:** All encryption modules must be FIPS 140-3 (or 140-2 transition) validated.
    *   *Check:* `openssl fipsinstall` verification in container boot.
*   **Data Residency:** CONUS-only storage and processing.

### 3.2 Access Control (CMMC AC.L2-3.1.x)
*   **US Persons:** Operational access restricted to verified US Persons (where required by specific contract/ITAR).
*   **MFA:** Phishing-resistant MFA (YubiKey/WebAuthn) mandatory for all administrative access.
*   **Privileged Access:** Just-in-Time (JIT) access only; no standing admin privileges.

## 4. FedRAMP Moderate Alignment
CMMC Level 2 is aligned with NIST 800-171, which maps to FedRAMP Moderate.

*   **Gap Analysis:** We track the "NIST 800-171 vs. 800-53" delta in `compliance/cmmc_gap_analysis.csv`.
*   **Inheritance:** We inherit physical security controls from the underlying CSP (AWS GovCloud/Azure Gov).

## 5. Incident Reporting (DFARS 252.204-7012)
*   **Timeline:** Incidents affecting CUI must be reported to DoD CIO within **72 hours**.
*   **Evidence preservation:** Capture image of affected systems immediately. Do not reboot/clean until forensic copy is made.
*   **Chain of Custody:** strict logging of who handled the evidence.

## 6. Development Lifecycle
*   **Code repositories:** Source code typically does NOT contain CUI.
*   **Test Data:** **NEVER** use real CUI for testing. Use synthetic data generated by `scripts/generate_synthetic_cui.py`.
