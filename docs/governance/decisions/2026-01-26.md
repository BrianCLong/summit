# Governance Decision Record - 2026-01-26

## Context
A recovery operation was initiated to salvage value from unmerged branches and consolidate governance artifacts for GA readiness. Multiple duplicate implementations of provenance generation were found.

## Decisions

### 1. Canonicalization of Provenance
- **Decision:** Adopt `scripts/compliance/generate_provenance.ts` as the single source of truth for SLSA v1.1 provenance generation.
- **Rationale:** Aligns with governance directory structure while maintaining industry-standard formatting.
- **Action:** Deleted `.ci/gen-provenance.js` and `.ci/verify-provenance.js`. Updated `Makefile` and `scripts/merge_s25.sh`.

### 2. Canonicalization of SBOM
- **Decision:** Adopt `scripts/compliance/generate_sbom.ts` as the canonical SBOM generator.
- **Rationale:** Centralizes compliance scripts.
- **Action:** Updated script to generate valid CycloneDX JSON.

### 3. Security Hardening Salvage
- **Decision:** Cherry-picked fail-closed export signing logic from `sentinel-fix-export-fail-closed`.
- **Rationale:** Critical security vulnerability fix required for GA.

### 4. Governance Constraints (Turn 7)
- **Decision:** Adopted `governance/constraints.yaml` and associated verification scripts from `jules-turn-7-constraints`.
- **Rationale:** Enforces required release abort gates (Turn #7).

### 5. Observability Integration
- **Decision:** Integrated Grafana dashboards and Loki/Promtail config from `summit-monitoring-observability`.
- **Rationale:** Provides necessary visibility for GA operations.

## Status
- **GA Readiness:** Improved.
- **Duplication:** Reduced.
- **Traceability:** High.
