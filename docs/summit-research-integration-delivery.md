# Summit Research Integration Delivery Report

This report documents the implementation work that operationalises the research integration plan across Summit's product pillars.

## GraphAI Platform
- Added federated query planning primitives that respect locality, sovereignty, and privacy budgets, exposed via new FastAPI endpoints for planning, diffusion analytics, and graph foundation model benchmarking.
- Implemented analytics utilities for distribution-shift detection, fluid diffusion community weighting, and narrative telemetry aggregation to support Influence Operations (IO) heuristics.

## Maestro Conductor & Workflow Automation
- Extended the orchestration planner with residency-aware scoring, sovereign routing enforcement, and privacy cost tracking.
- Introduced narrative scorecard recording with automatic playbook augmentation to keep response libraries aligned with emerging disinformation tactics.

## Analyst Workbench
- Enhanced the tri-pane controller with narrative telemetry ingestion, emotional risk scoring, and volatility measurement to drive narrative forensics dashboards.

## Governance & Trust Layer
- Augmented the policy engine with Just Intelligence guardrails requiring explicit collection justification, proportionality checks, and bias audit mitigations before high-risk operations can proceed.
- Expanded provenance logging via federated workcell plans to capture privacy costs, residency decisions, and policy rationales per subgraph query.

## Cross-Cutting Outcomes
- New automated obligations highlight rapid-response communications, disclosure charters, and media-literacy boosts when IO signatures escalate.
- The delivery work maintains end-to-end traceability from policy decisions through runtime orchestration and analyst-facing diagnostics.
