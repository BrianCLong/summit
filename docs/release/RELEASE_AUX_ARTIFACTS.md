# Release Auxiliary Artifacts

## Current Release Artifacts
The current release process generates the following artifacts:

1.  **Docker Images**: Built and pushed to the container registry via release workflows (`release-ga.yml`, `release-train.yml`).
2.  **Supply Chain Compliance Bundle**: Generated by `scripts/bundle-release-evidence.sh`. This includes:
    *   SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials)
    *   Signatures (Cosign)
    *   Vulnerability Reports
    *   Provenance Attestations
    *   Basic configuration file snapshots
    *   This artifact is critical for SLSA Level 3 compliance and is cryptographically signed.

## Proposed Ops Evidence Pack (Adjunct)

The **Ops Evidence Pack** is a new, optional artifact designed to support operational teams and incident response. It is distinct from the supply-chain compliance bundle and is **not** signed or part of the SLSA provenance chain.

### Contents
The Ops Evidence Pack aggregates:
*   **Operational Documentation**: Runbooks (`docs/ops/`, `docs/runbooks/`).
*   **Monitoring Configuration**: Alert rules (`monitoring/alerts.yaml`), Dashboards (`monitoring/dashboards/`).
*   **System Configuration**: Sanitized configuration files and Kubernetes manifests.
*   **Operational Scripts**: Tools from `scripts/ops/` for debugging and maintenance.

### Generation & Release
*   **Generator Script**: `scripts/verification/generate_ops_evidence_pack.sh`
*   **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/generate-ops-evidence-pack.yml`
*   **Trigger**:
    *   Manual `workflow_dispatch` on demand.
    *   Optional `upload_to_release` flag to attach the pack to a GitHub Release.

### Usage
This pack is intended for:
*   **Incident Response**: Rapid access to the runbooks and alerts active at the time of release.
*   **Audits**: Operational process verification (distinct from code/artifact verification).
*   **Pre-GA Handoff**: Providing Ops teams with a snapshot of the operational surface.
