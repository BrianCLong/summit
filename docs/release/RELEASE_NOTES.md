# v5.4.0-batch3 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-01-29
**Release Type:** Batch 3 Feature Release
**Release Captain:** Antigravity

---

## Highlights

This release consolidates "Day 2" advanced capabilities into the Summit Platform, including Audit Logging, Agent Skills Architecture, and Cognitive Resilience. It also includes the previously integrated Batch 1 (Unblockers) and Batch 2 (Evidence/OSINT) foundation layers.

---

## Integrated Features (Batch 3)

### Compliance & Safety

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging service for all sensitive Investigation and Evidence actions.
- **Cognitive Resilience**: New MOE module (`CognitiveShaping`) to mitigate analyst potential bias and cognitive load.

### AI & Agents

- **Agent Skills Registry**: Python-based registry for dynamic skill registration, enabling easier extension of agent capabilities.

### Foundations (Batch 1 & 2 Included)

- **Evidence Framework**: Migrated to V1 Array schema for Evidence Bundles.
- **OSINT Module**: Core OSINT ingestion capabilities (News API, Twitter/X scraper stubs).
- **Environment**: Unified `.env.example` and health check endpoints.

---

## Upgrade Notes

1.  **Database Migration**: Run `pnpm db:migrate` to apply the new Audit Log schemas.
2.  **Evidence Format**: Legacy `dictionary`-based evidence indexes are deprecated. The system defaults to the `array`-based V1 format. The `EvidenceWriter` class handles this transparently.
