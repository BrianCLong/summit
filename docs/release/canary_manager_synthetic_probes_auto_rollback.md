# Reliability & Release Initiative — Canary Manager, Synthetic Probes, Auto-Rollback

## Mission & Outcomes

- **Objective:** Reduce change-failure rate through coordinated canary orchestration, synthetic verification, and automated rollback governed by policy.
- **Key Results:**
  - Median rollback execution < 5 minutes.
  - False abort rate < 2% per quarter.
  - Synthetic probe service availability ≥ 99.9%.

## Scope (MVP, 6 Weeks)

1. **Canary Controller**
   - Deploy Argo Rollouts (or Flagger) with standardized rollout templates (`rollouts.yaml`).
   - Integrate metrics-based promotions using multiple indicators (latency, error rate, saturation, synthetic probe scores).
   - Emit promote/abort webhooks to downstream automations.
2. **Synthetic Probe Service**
   - Implement HTTP flow definitions in YAML, mapped to SLO objectives.
   - Support environment-specific targets (staging, pre-prod, prod) with shared libraries for auth/session setup.
   - Stream probe results to observability platform and error-budget calculators.
3. **Rollback Engine**
   - Automate rollback through CI/CD integration with policy evaluation (error budget, change windows).
   - Enforce signed manifest validation and admission policy checks before promotion.

## Definition of Ready

- Documented promotion criteria and guardrail thresholds for each environment.
- Published error budget policies (limits, burn-rate formulas, freeze conditions).
- Enumerated target environments with required blast-radius limits and dependencies.

## Definition of Done

- Canary promotions require both synthetic probe passes and real-user metric health.
- Automatic rollback triggers on SLO burn or policy violations, completing within the target <5m median.
- Promotion, probe, and rollback events logged with signed evidence artifacts.

## Deliverables

- Versioned `rollouts.yaml` templates and controller configuration packs.
- Synthetic probe definitions (YAML) plus shared libraries for auth, fixtures, and observability wiring.
- Rollout playbooks covering promotion, pause, abort, and rollback drills.
- Dashboards: SLO burn, canary cohort comparison, synthetic probe reliability, and rollback latency.
- Incident runbook for rollback execution and verification.
- Promotion and rollback logs archived for compliance evidence.

## Interfaces

- **Rollout manifests:** `rollouts.yaml` (per service); annotation schema documented.
- **Synthetic probes:** YAML flows referencing shared configs; schedule + SLO binding metadata.
- **Automation webhooks:** Promote/abort endpoints for notifying CI/CD, ChatOps, and incident tooling.

## Security Gates

- All deployment manifests must be signed (cosign/Sigstore) prior to admission.
- Admission controllers reject unsigned container images.
- Policy checks enforce provenance and environment-specific allowlists before promotion.

## Observability & Evidence

- Live dashboards demonstrating healthy canary promotion.
- Recorded rollback simulation/game-day showcasing automated recovery.
- Promotion logs capturing decision criteria, metrics snapshots, and signatures.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Metric flakiness:** Use composite health scoring across primary metrics, synthetic probes, and event logs; include manual override protocol.
- **Hidden dependencies:** Synthetic end-to-end probes mimic real user journeys to surface upstream/downstream coupling issues.
- **Probe drift:** Periodic replay validation and schema linting to maintain probe fidelity.

## Track B (Post-MVP Explorations)

- Adaptive canaries that adjust traffic weights and feature flags based on live metric confidence.
- Chaos-lite fault injections during canary stages to validate rollback responsiveness.
