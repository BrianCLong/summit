# Maestro Service Level Objectives (SLOs) Documentation

## Overview

This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the Maestro platform, along with their corresponding Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Error Budgets. These SLOs are critical for ensuring the reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness of Maestro services.

## Key SLOs

### 1. API Response Latency

*   **Objective:** 99.5% of API requests should complete within 200ms over a 30-day rolling window.
*   **SLI:** `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` (latency metric from Prometheus/Grafana).
*   **Error Budget:** 0.5% of requests can exceed the 200ms threshold.
*   **Burn Rate Alerts:** Configured to trigger warnings at 5% and critical alerts at 10% error budget consumption.

### 2. Database Availability

*   **Objective:** Database should be available 99.9% of the time over a 30-day rolling window.
*   **SLI:** Ratio of successful database requests to total database requests.
*   **Error Budget:** 0.1% of downtime is tolerated.
*   **Burn Rate Alerts:** Configured for early warning and critical alerts based on burn rate.

### 3. Run Success Rate

*   **Objective:** Maestro runs should succeed 99.0% of the time over a 7-day rolling window.
*   **SLI:** Ratio of successful Maestro runs to total Maestro runs.
*   **Error Budget:** 1.0% of runs can fail.
*   **Burn Rate Alerts:** Configured for early warning and critical alerts based on burn rate.

## Error Budget Policy

Error budgets are consumed when the SLI falls below the defined objective. When the error budget is consumed, it triggers alerts and may lead to operational reviews and prioritization of reliability work.

## Alerting Strategy

Burn rate alerts are configured in Prometheus/Alertmanager and integrated with the Maestro AlertCenter. Alerts are categorized by severity (warning, critical) and routed to appropriate on-call teams (email, Slack, PagerDuty).

## Weekly Review Process

A weekly review meeting is held with relevant stakeholders (Engineering, Product, Operations) to:
*   Review current SLO compliance.
*   Analyze error budget consumption.
*   Identify trends and potential issues.
*   Prioritize reliability work based on error budget burn.
