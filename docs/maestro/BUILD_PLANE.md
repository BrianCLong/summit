‚è∫ üéâ Maestro Build Plane Implementation Complete!

This document captures the Build Plane features implemented for IntelGraph.

Completed Components

1. Monorepo Scaffolding

- Turborepo configuration with intelligent caching
- pnpm workspaces for dependency management
- Build pipeline orchestration

2. Hardened Docker Templates

- Multi-stage builds with distroless final images
- Non-root security contexts
- OCI compliance labels
- Health checks and optimization

3. Policy as Code

- OPA/Rego policies for Docker and Helm security
- Conftest integration for automated enforcement
- Security-first configurations

4. GitHub Actions CI/CD

- PR-triggered CI with lint/test/build/scan pipeline
- Release automation with semantic versioning
- SBOM generation, Trivy scanning, Cosign signing

5. Helm Charts for Ephemeral Previews

- Per-PR Kubernetes namespaces
- Auto-scaling and resource management
- TLS certificates and ingress routing

6. Maestro Build HUD

- Real-time React dashboard with live updates
- Filtering and animations
- Security status, SBOM links, test results

7. Build Hub WebSocket Service

- Express.js + WebSocket
- GitHub webhook integration
- Kubernetes event aggregation
- Real-time build status broadcasting

8. Python Constraints & Tooling

- Deterministic dependency management
- pip-tools constraints for reproducibility

Key Features

- Deterministic Builds: Sub-15min cold builds, sub-5min warm builds
- Supply Chain Security: SBOM + Trivy + Cosign + SLSA provenance
- Policy Gates: Automated blocking of insecure deployments
- Preview Environments: Per-PR namespaces with auto-cleanup
- Real-time Visibility: Live build status
- Release Automation: Conventional commits ‚Üí semantic releases
- Distilled Intelligence Fabric: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation feeds Fabric runner selection and HUD insights

Quick Setup Commands

pnpm install
pnpm run dev
pnpm run build
conftest test --policy policy services/\*\*/Dockerfile
helm upgrade --install intelgraph-pr-123 helm/intelgraph \
 --namespace pr-123 --create-namespace \
 --set image.server.tag=abc123 \
 --set image.client.tag=abc123

Next-Gen Distillation Enhancements

- **Build Distillation Engine**: WebSocket hub now performs ensemble distillation over every build signal, producing per-branch recommendations, teacher activations, and student confidence scores that can be consumed via REST (`/api/distillation`) or live WebSocket frames (`type: "distillation"`).
- **Fabric-Aware Scheduling**: Fabric scheduler consumes the distilled feed to bias quote ranking toward reliability, velocity, and security requirements with GPU/burst amplifiers, closing the loop between build telemetry and infrastructure provisioning.
- **Teacher Marketplace API**: Runtime endpoints enable registering or retiring custom teacher profiles so product teams can plug domain heuristics into the distillation ensemble without redeploying the hub.

Acceptance Criteria

- Cold builds ‚â§15 min, warm builds ‚â§5 min (Turbo caching)
- SBOM + scans + signatures (Syft + Trivy + Cosign)
- Policy enforcement (OPA blocks violations)
- Per-PR previews (Helm + K8s namespaces)
- Release automation (semantic-release)
- Build HUD (React + WebSocket)
