# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1) Executive Summary
**Product**: Maestro Build Platform (MBP)

**Owner**: TBD (Platform PM)

**Status**: Draft

**Last Updated**: 2025‑09‑02

**Vision**: A unified, Git‑native build & deploy platform that fuses the best of modern PaaS, serverless/edge, and CI/CD—delivering instant previews, hermetic builds with global caching, progressive delivery, and enterprise‑grade governance by default.

**Target Users**: Frontend & full‑stack devs, platform engineers/SREs, security/compliance leads, data & AI teams, product squads at startups → enterprise.

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Hermetic builds + remote cache** across monorepos and languages (Bazel/BuildKit class), dramatically shrinking cycle time.
- **Universal runtimes & targets** (Edge/Workers, Functions, Containers, Static) with one declarative manifest.
- **Progressive delivery & rollbacks** baked in (canary, blue/green, feature flags) with policy‑aware guardrails.
- **Provenance, SBOM & SLSA‑class attestations** generated per build for compliance and supply‑chain security.
- **Cost guardrails & FinOps**—budgets, heatmaps, and per‑project efficiency scores.

**Success (12 months)**:
- p95 time‑to‑first‑deploy ≤ 10 minutes for new repos
- Build cache hit rate ≥ 60% org‑wide; p95 incremental build time ≤ 3 minutes
- Rollback time ≤ 60 seconds (any target)
- Net promoter score (Dev) ≥ 55; monthly active projects ≥ 2,500

**Strategic Alignment**: Accelerates product delivery, reduces infra toil, and raises security posture—positioning MBP as the opinionated “golden path” without vendor lock‑in.

**High‑Level Scope (MVP → GA)**: Git‑native pipelines & previews, universal builder, global cache, multi‑runtime deploys (Edge/Functions/Containers/Static), observability, secrets, SSO/RBAC, audit, policy‑as‑code, canary & instant rollback, managed Postgres/Redis, queues/cron, global CDN.

**Rough Effort**: 10–14 eng for MVP (3 squads: Build, Runtime, Platform), + shared SRE/Design/Sec.

---

## 2) Problem Statement & Opportunity
**Problems today**
- Fragmented toolchain (CI, artifacts, deploy, CDN, DB, observability) → context switching & slow feedback.
- Unreliable caching across monorepos; cold builds & redundant work balloon costs.
- Edge/serverless/container options require different manifests & mental models.
- Rollbacks are risky, compliance is bolt‑on, and FinOps lacks real‑time signals.

**Opportunity**
- Consolidate the best of Vercel/Netlify (DX, previews), Render/Railway/Fly.io (simplicity + containers), Cloudflare (edge), GitHub/GitLab (pipeline ergonomics), and enterprise policy/audit—into one **opinionated yet portable** platform.
- TAM spans startups to enterprise platform teams; clear willingness to pay for speed, security, and governance.

**Primary Outcomes**
- **Lead**: time‑to‑merge & deploy shrinks 30–60%.
- **Secure**: SBOM/attestation coverage 100% of builds.
- **Efficient**: ≥ 25% infra cost reduction via cache hits, right‑sizing, and budgets.

## 3) User Requirements & Stories
**Personas**
1. **Frontend Dev (Maya)** – wants instant previews, framework autodetect, on‑demand revalidation, zero YAML.
2. **Full‑stack Dev (Arman)** – needs functions + DB + queues with local dev parity and easy secrets.
3. **Platform Eng/SRE (Jules)** – demands hermetic builds, reproducibility, policy gates, and fast rollbacks.
4. **Security Lead (Rina)** – needs SBOMs, provenance, SSO/RBAC/SCIM, OPA policies, audit search.
5. **FinOps/Eng Manager (Kai)** – cares about budgets, usage caps, heatmaps, and cost per deploy.

**Top Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done**
- As a dev, I commit code and get a live preview URL in < 2 minutes.
- As an SRE, I can roll back any service in < 60 seconds with zero data loss.
- As Security, I can prove what code/artifacts were deployed, by whom, under what policy.
- As FinOps, I can set budgets and see per‑PR cost deltas before merge.

**Representative User Stories (MVP)**
- *Preview Envs*: “As a dev, I want auto PR previews with seeded data so PMs can review UI without local setup.”
  - **Acceptance**: URL posted to Git provider; data seeded via snapshot; expires on PR close; password‑optional.
- *Remote Cache*: “As an SRE, I want remote cache for monorepo builds so re‑runs avoid redundant work.”
  - **Acceptance**: ≥60% cache hit rate on labeled demo monorepo; cache keys include lockfiles + toolchain.
- *Progressive Delivery*: “As a platform eng, I want canary & blue/green for functions/containers.”
  - **Acceptance**: traffic splitting 1–99%; automated rollback on SLO breach; one‑click/manual override.
- *Provenance*: “As Security, I want SBOM + SLSA attestations per build and signed releases.”
  - **Acceptance**: SBOM (SPDX/CycloneDX) attached; in‑toto attestations; verify via CLI.
- *Budgets*: “As FinOps, I want per‑project budgets and alerts.”
  - **Acceptance**: caps & soft limits; PR shows projected delta; Slack/Email alerts on breach.

**Resourcing**
- *Build Squad*: pipeline, cache, runners, SBOM/provenance.
- *Runtime Squad*: deploy targets, rollout controller, edge/CDN.
- *Platform Squad*: control plane, identity/policy, observability, billing/FinOps.

## 10) Risks & Mitigations
- **Cache correctness & security** → content‑addressed keys; per‑tenant isolation; TTLs; provenance pinning.
- **Rollout safety** → health gates, automated rollback, error budget policies, dark‑launch.
- **Cold start costs** → warm pools for functions; predictive prebuilds; edge compute for latency‑sensitive paths.
- **Vendor lock‑in perception** → portable artifacts (OCI), open manifest, export tools.
- **Compliance scope creep** → prioritize SLSA/SBOM first; stage SOC2; later HIPAA/PCI add‑ons.
