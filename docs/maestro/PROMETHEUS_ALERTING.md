# Maestro Prometheus Alerting & Runbooks Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for Prometheus alerting and the integration with runbooks for the Maestro platform. Effective alerting ensures timely detection of issues, and well-defined runbooks facilitate rapid response and resolution.

## Alerting Principles

- **Actionable Alerts:** Alerts should indicate a clear problem that requires human intervention.
- **Severity-Based:** Alerts are categorized by severity (e.g., critical, warning) to prioritize response.
- **Runbook-Driven:** Every alert should have a corresponding runbook to guide the response.
- **Minimize False Positives:** Alert thresholds are continuously tuned to reduce alert fatigue.

## Alert Categories

### 1. Service Level Objective (SLO) Alerts

- **Purpose:** Triggered when SLOs are breached or error budgets are burning rapidly.
- **Metrics:** Latency, error rate, availability, cost.
- **Examples:**
  - `SLOBurnRateHigh`: Error budget consumption is accelerating.
  - `SLOErrorBudgetExhausted`: Error budget is fully consumed.

### 2. System Health Alerts

- **Purpose:** Monitor the health and performance of underlying infrastructure and services.
- **Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network throughput, process health.
- **Examples:**
  - `HostHighCpuUsage`: Server CPU utilization exceeds threshold.
  - `DiskFull`: Filesystem usage is critically high.

### 3. Application-Specific Alerts

- **Purpose:** Monitor application-specific metrics and business logic.
- **Metrics:** Queue depth, batch processing rates, API call failures, specific error codes.
- **Examples:**
  - `MaestroQueueDepthHigh`: Message queue depth is increasing rapidly.
  - `RoutingDecisionFailures`: High rate of failed routing decisions.

## Alert Threshold Tuning

- **Baseline Analysis:** Establish baselines for normal system behavior.
- **Historical Data:** Analyze historical data to identify patterns and set appropriate thresholds.
- **Feedback Loop:** Continuously review alert effectiveness and adjust thresholds based on false positives/negatives.
- **7-Day Review:** Regular review of alert performance to ensure <2% false positives.

## Blackbox Probes

- **Purpose:** Monitor external-facing endpoints and critical user journeys from an outside perspective.
- **Tools:** Prometheus Blackbox Exporter.
- **Checks:** HTTP status codes, response times, content validation.

## Tenant-Aware Cost Guards

- **Purpose:** Monitor and alert on cost overruns for individual tenants.
- **Metrics:** Cost per tenant, cost per pipeline, cost per model.
- **Alerts:** Triggered when tenant spending approaches or exceeds defined budgets.

## Paging Review

- Regular review of paging policies and on-call rotations to ensure alerts reach the right people at the right time.
- Post-incident reviews include an assessment of alert effectiveness and paging response.

## Runbook Integration

Every alert is linked to a specific runbook that provides step-by-step instructions for investigation, diagnosis, and resolution.
