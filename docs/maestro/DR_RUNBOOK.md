# Maestro Disaster Recovery (DR) Runbook

## Overview

This runbook outlines the procedures and considerations for recovering the Maestro platform in the event of a disaster. It covers Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective (RPO), and failover procedures to a secondary region.

## Objectives

*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** <Define RTO, e.g., 4 hours>
*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** <Define RPO, e.g., 15 minutes>

## Architecture for DR

*   **Primary Region:** <e.g., AWS us-east-1>
*   **Secondary Region:** <e.g., AWS us-west-2>
*   **Data Replication:** <Describe data replication strategy, e.g., continuous asynchronous replication of databases, S3 cross-region replication>
*   **Application Deployment:** <Describe how applications are deployed in the secondary region, e.g., IaC templates, pre-provisioned instances>

## Failover Procedures

This section details the step-by-step process for initiating a failover to the secondary region.

### 1. Declare Disaster

*   Confirm disaster impact and scope.
*   Initiate incident response process (refer to On-call & Escalation documentation).

### 2. Initiate Failover

*   **DNS Update:** Update DNS records to point to the secondary region's load balancers/endpoints.
*   **Database Failover:** Promote replica database in secondary region to primary.
*   **Application Deployment/Scaling:** Deploy or scale up application instances in the secondary region.
*   **Dependency Checks:** Verify connectivity to all external dependencies (e.g., IdPs, external APIs).

### 3. Post-Failover Verification

*   Perform smoke tests on all critical functionalities.
*   Monitor system health and performance.
*   Confirm RTO/RPO targets are met.

## Failback Procedures

This section outlines the process for returning operations to the primary region once the disaster is resolved.

## Quarterly DR Drills

Regular quarterly DR drills are conducted to:
*   Validate the runbook procedures.
*   Test the effectiveness of replication and failover mechanisms.
*   Train on-call teams.
*   Identify areas for improvement.

(Drill reports and findings are maintained in a separate system.)
