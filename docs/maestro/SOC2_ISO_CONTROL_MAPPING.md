# Maestro SOC2/ISO Control Mapping Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a mapping of SOC2 Trust Services Criteria and ISO 27001 controls to Maestro's technical implementations and the evidence collected to demonstrate compliance. This mapping is essential for auditability and maintaining our security and compliance posture.

## ISO 27001 Annex A Controls Mapping

(This section would detail the mapping of ISO 27001 Annex A controls to Maestro's implementations. It would follow a similar table format as the SOC2 mapping.)

## Evidence Collection

Evidence for each control is collected and stored in a WORM-compliant manner. PRs are blocked if required evidence is missing, ensuring an auditable trail.

- **Evidence Storage:** S3 Object Lock (Compliance mode)
- **PR Enforcement:** `enforce-ga-gates` workflow
- **Auditor Access:** Secure access to evidence repository and audit logs.
