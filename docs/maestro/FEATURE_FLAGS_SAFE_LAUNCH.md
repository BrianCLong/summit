# Maestro Feature Flags & Safe Launch Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines Maestro's strategy for using feature flags to enable safe and controlled launches of new features. Feature flags facilitate dark launches, progressive exposure, and provide immediate rollback capabilities, minimizing risk during deployment.

## Feature Flag Service (Conceptual)

Maestro utilizes a feature flag service to dynamically control the availability of features without requiring code deployments.

*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   **Toggle Features:** Turn features on/off for specific users, groups, or environments.
    *   **Targeting:** Define rules for who sees a feature (e.g., by tenant, user ID, percentage of users).
    *   **Rollout Management:** Control the gradual rollout of features (progressive exposure).
    *   **Kill Switch:** Immediately disable a problematic feature.
    *   **Telemetry Integration:** Track feature usage and impact.

*   **Integration Points:**
    *   **Backend:** Feature flag checks in API endpoints and business logic.
    *   **Frontend:** Conditional rendering of UI components based on flag status.
    *   **CI/CD:** Automated testing of features under different flag states.

## Safe Launch Strategies

### 1. Dark Launch

*   **Description:** Deploying a new feature to production with its feature flag turned off for all users. This allows for testing in a production environment without impacting users.
*   **Use Cases:** Performance testing, integration testing with other production services, validating deployment pipelines.

### 2. Progressive Exposure (Canary Rollouts with Flags)

*   **Description:** Gradually rolling out a new feature to a small percentage of users, then incrementally increasing the exposure.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Enable feature for internal users/QA.
    2.  Enable for 1% of users.
    3.  Monitor key metrics (SLOs, errors, performance).
    4.  If stable, increase to 5%, then 10%, 50%, and finally 100%.
*   **Rollback:** If issues are detected, the feature flag can be immediately toggled off, effectively rolling back the feature without a code deployment.

## Telemetry & Monitoring

Comprehensive telemetry is collected for all feature flags to monitor their impact and detect anomalies.

*   **Metrics:** Feature usage counts, performance metrics (latency, errors) for code paths under flags, A/B test results.
*   **Dashboards:** Dedicated dashboards to visualize feature flag rollouts and their impact on key metrics.
*   **Alerts:** Alerts configured for significant deviations in metrics when a feature flag is enabled or changed.

## Rollback by Flag

The ability to toggle a feature flag off serves as an immediate rollback mechanism, allowing for rapid response to production issues caused by new features.

## Flags in Repository

Feature flag definitions (e.g., default states, targeting rules) are managed as code in the repository, ensuring version control and auditability.
