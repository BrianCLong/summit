# Maestro “Autonomous Intelligence” — Executive One‑Pager

**What it is**  
A provenance‑first orchestration plane that coordinates heterogeneous AI models, agents, tools, and pipelines with hard guardrails (policy, cost, SLOs) and progressive autonomy (L0–L5). It routes across providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/NIM/vLLM), manages multi‑agent graphs, and ships with EvalOps + progressive delivery so autonomy is earned via metrics.

**Why it matters (unfair advantages)**

- **Evidence‑first by design**: Every action has inputs, policies hit, costs, and traces — signed into a provenance ledger.
- **Policy‑aware routing**: Jurisdiction/PII tags drive model selection; dual‑control for high autonomy.
- **EvalOps gates**: Changes to agents/prompts/models cannot land without scorecards and SLO burn forecasts.
- **Utilization & cost wins**: vLLM+Ray continuous batching, KV reuse, auto‑spill/fallback; portfolio router optimizes for quality/latency/cost/reliability/sovereignty.
- **Safe speed**: Canary + analysis + instant rollback for prompts/agents; kill‑switch + freeze windows.

**Primary users**

- Operators/SRE, Developers/Prompt & Agent Authors, Release/Compliance, Stakeholders/Analysts.

**Key capabilities (v1)**

- Agent Graphs with HITL and resumability; Router with pins, content tags, fallbacks; EvalOps scorecards; vLLM serve lane; Progressive delivery; Evidence‑first UI (DAG, Timeline, node logs, CI annotations, Compare prev; Routing Studio; Pipelines Validate/Explain; Secrets status/test; Obs embeds).

**Targets (SLOs/KPIs)**

- Router decision < **50ms p95** in‑cluster
- Serving throughput **≥ 2.5×** baseline; cost/request **≥ −20%**
- Brownout fallback success **> 98%**
- Scorecard quality **≥ +5%** over baseline; hallucination **≤ 1.0%**
- MTTR with auto‑rollback **< 2 min**; canary time **−30%**

**60‑Day Plan (milestones)**

- **M1 (Wks 1–2):** Router shadow, OTEL wrappers, Eval runner skeleton
- **M2 (Wks 3–4):** vLLM lane + telemetry, Scorecards UI, Router Decision panel
- **M3 (Wks 5–6):** Canary+rollback, Alerts & budgets, Providers status/test
- **M4 (Wks 7–8):** Agent Graphs+HITL, Autonomy gates, Chaos drills, Graph diff

**Top risks & mitigations**

- Provider brownouts → multi‑region, fallbacks, chaos drills
- Cost spikes → per‑step caps + auto‑downgrade, alerts
- Quality drift → nightly evals, PR blocks on thresholds
- Policy gaps → default‑deny unknown tags, dual‑control

**Asks**

- GPU budget for vLLM lane; CI permissions for GH annotations; Grafana/Prom/Loki cluster; policy owner for jurisdiction taxonomy.
