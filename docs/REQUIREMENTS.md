# Summit Project Requirements (Civil War Use Case)

Summit should enable resilient, covert, and high-throughput OSINT/graph analytics, team orchestration, and autonomous operations in hostile, fragmented, or degraded environments.

---

### Feature Checklist for Summit (Civil War Use Case)

- Data Ingest & Collection
  - "Collect real-time data streams from social media, emergency feeds, encrypted messaging, HAM/shortwave, and sensor networks"
  - "Ingest breached credentials, domain infrastructure, and custom datasets from conflict sources for threat mapping"

- Threat Intelligence, Early Warning & Incident Response
  - "Automate detection of actor clusters, botnets, and coordinated information/narrative campaigns"
  - "Identify fake accounts and digital disinformation using network, engagement, and content pattern analysis"
  - "Integrate third-party and custom threat databases for rapid identification of hostile units, actors, and infrastructure"

- Temporal, Geospatial, and Cross-platform Correlation
  - "Map activity timelines to spot campaign launches, mobilization events, and critical system compromise windows"
  - "Correlate and visualize cross-platform account clusters and duplicative messaging for tracking adversary comms"
  - "Geospatially display incidents, chokepoints, safe zones, and infrastructure targets on live-updating maps"

- Orchestration, Automation, and Autonomous Agent OPS
  - "Define and trigger runbooks for incident response, field requests, supply chain/evacuation tasking, asset protection, and remote server management—automated with escalation steps"
  - "Deploy fleets of specialized autonomous agents for info collection, analysis, posting, or multi-channel dissemination"
  - "Automate onboarding/extraction of team personnel with all cross-system access, lockout, and audit controls"

- Secure Collaboration, Redundancy, and C2
  - "Collaboratively manage project, versioning, branching, and CI/CD with secure, permissioned Git workflows—enable fork/merge for parallel ops"
  - "Embed secret scanning and vulnerability alerts for all code, configs, and deployed assets"
  - "Integrate encrypted storage, secure artifact transmission, and fault-tolerant data sync across split networks"
  - "Continuous availability checks and self-healing protocols for critical services, embedded in orchestration layer"

- Monitoring, Audit, and Governance
  - "Enable live logs and visual dashboards for workflow status, trigger outcomes, and audit trails"
  - "Automate SLA, authorization, and workflow rules for safe, compliant deployment in zero-trust/contested environments"
  - "Enforce process, credential, and operation separation at all layers for resilience against supply chain and inside threats"

### Prompt Examples for Specific Features

- "Summit, ingest all priority sources and route through graph analytics with timestamp and actor attribution overlays."
- "Orchestrate real-time threat detection runbooks for flagged comms, spinning up agent fleets for cross-platform sweep and attribution."
- "Deploy agent nets to triangulate physical and online emergent threats by combining social streams, breach records, and device pings."
- "Automate vetting, credential lifecycle, mission access, and remote revocation—log every access for after-action review."
- "Map infrastructure sabotage, humanitarian zones, and adversary strongholds with temporal and geospatial update overlays."
- "Enable resilient, permissioned code collaboration and CI/CD for distributed teams; harden all workflows against interception or compromise."
- "Audit all workflow results and auto-escalations; export visual dashboards and log digests to secure, off-network storage."

### Use Case Deep Dive

| Use Case                | Purpose                                   | Tech/Prompt Summary                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intelligence Collection | Map conflict actors, threat movements     | "Ingest channels, correlate signals, visualize graph with timelines" |
| Incident Response       | Automate alerting/mitigation of breaches  | "Runbook triggers, multi-step auto response, agent deployment"       |
| Secure Comms/Collab     | Resilient team ops in split networks      | "GitOps, CI/CD with secret scanning, encrypted sync"                 |
| Influence Monitoring    | Track info ops, narrative manipulation    | "Cross-platform analysis, bot/fake detection, actor clustering"      |
| Tactical Orchestration  | Field team, asset, evac, supply chain ops | "Automate requests, resource allocation, live status checks"         |

### State Assumptions:

- Communications, power, and cloud may be degraded or intermittently available—drive for edge, resilient, multi-platform deployment.
- Security, privacy, attribution, and auditability of every action matter; conflict context privileges zero-trust and anomaly detection.
- Needs include high agility for team scaling, parallelization for mass events, and code isolation for adversarial scenarios.

All prompts above enable tactical, operational, and strategic response in civil war conditions—with documented provenance, chain of custody, and audit.
