# Moat Analysis: Why Summit Holds for 10 Years

## 1. Executive Summary

Summit is building a **Compound Moat** that integrates technical superiority with regulatory lock-in. Competitors may copy our features, but they cannot replicate our **Data Gravity** or **Governance Entanglement**.

## 2. The Four Moat Layers

### Layer 1: The Technical Moat (Coordination Physics)

* **The Advantage:** We detect *coordination*, not *content*. This is physics, not semantics.
* **Why it's durable:** AI models will get better at lying (semantics), but they cannot bypass the laws of thermodynamics (entropy). Generating "organic" traffic patterns requires exponentially more compute/cost for the attacker.
* **Defensibility:** High. Requires fundamental graph-architecture, not just an API wrapper.

### Layer 2: The Data Moat (Provenance Graph)

* **The Advantage:** Every detection feeds the `NarrativeLineage` graph. The more we detect, the smarter the system becomes at fingerprinting actor TTPs.
* **Why it's durable:** Network effects. A detected swarm on Client A protects Client B instantly.
* **Defensibility:** Medium-High. Data accumulates over time.

### Layer 3: The Governance Moat (Compliance Lock-In)

* **The Advantage:** We output **Audit-Grade Evidence Bundles** mapped to SOC-2 and ISO.
* **Why it's durable:** Once a Board adopts Summit as their "System of Record" for risk, switching costs become prohibitive. We become the "ERP of Risk."
* **Defensibility:** Very High. Regulatory integration creates sticky enterprise contracts.

### Layer 4: The Narrative Moat (Category Definition)

* **The Advantage:** We framed the problem as "Infrastructure Defense," making "Content Moderation" look like a toy solution.
* **Why it's durable:** We own the language (e.g., "Swarm Entropy," "Narrative Shepherd").
* **Defensibility:** High. First-mover advantage in defining the mental model for CISOs.

## 3. Irreversible Advantage Flags

* [x] **Graph Ontology Standard:** We set the schema for how swarms are described.
* [x] **Regulatory Integration:** We are written into the compliance checklists.
* [x] **Cost Inversion:** We make it more expensive to attack than to defend.
