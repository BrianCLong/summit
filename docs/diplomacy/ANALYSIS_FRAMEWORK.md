## Relationship Analysis Framework

### Bilateral Relationship Assessment Model

#### 1. Relationship Quality Scoring (0-100)

**Components:**
- Political Relations (30%): Diplomatic engagement level, leadership rapport
- Economic Relations (25%): Trade volume, investment flows, economic interdependence
- Security Relations (20%): Defense cooperation, intelligence sharing, alliance membership
- Cultural Relations (15%): People-to-people ties, educational exchange, tourism
- Strategic Alignment (10%): UN voting alignment, shared values, common interests

**Calculation:**
```
Quality Score = (Political * 0.30) + (Economic * 0.25) + (Security * 0.20) +
                (Cultural * 0.15) + (Strategic * 0.10)
```

#### 2. Relationship Status Classification

- **Strategic Partnership** (80-100): Deep cooperation across all domains
- **Comprehensive Partnership** (70-79): Strong ties with minor friction
- **Normal** (50-69): Stable but transactional relationship
- **Strained** (35-49): Significant friction, limited cooperation
- **Tense** (20-34): High friction, minimal engagement
- **Hostile** (0-19): Adversarial, active conflict

#### 3. Trend Analysis

**Short-term Trend** (0-6 months):
- Based on recent events, statements, and actions
- High weight on current incidents

**Medium-term Trend** (6-24 months):
- Based on policy shifts and structural changes
- Balanced weighting of events

**Long-term Trend** (24+ months):
- Based on strategic interests and systemic factors
- Lower weight on individual incidents

#### 4. Trajectory Prediction

**Factors:**
- Leadership stability
- Domestic political pressures
- Economic interdependence
- Security environment
- Third-party influence

**Confidence Levels:**
- Very High (90-100%): Strong indicators, clear trajectory
- High (75-89%): Good indicators, probable trajectory
- Medium (50-74%): Mixed signals, uncertain trajectory
- Low (25-49%): Weak indicators, volatile situation
- Very Low (0-24%): Insufficient data, highly unpredictable

## Policy Analysis Methodology

#### 3. Policy Consistency Scoring

```
Consistency = 100 - (StdDev of positions over time * multiplier)
```

**Interpretation:**
- 90-100: Highly consistent
- 70-89: Generally consistent
- 50-69: Moderately consistent
- 30-49: Inconsistent
- 0-29: Highly volatile

#### 4. Policy Shift Detection

**Indicators:**

#### 5. Policy Alignment Calculation

```
Alignment(Country A, Country B) =
  Σ(Agreement on position i * weight i) / Σ(weight i) * 100
```

**Alignment Interpretation:**
- 90-100%: Near-complete alignment
- 70-89%: Strong alignment
- 50-69%: Moderate alignment
