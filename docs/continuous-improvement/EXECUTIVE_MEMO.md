# Executive Continuous Improvement Memo

**To:** Summit Leadership & Stakeholders
**From:** Continuous Improvement Systems Owner
**Subject:** Wiring Trust into Delivery Execution

### Summary

We have operationalized a closed-loop system where customer trust signals directly influence roadmap planning. Summit now learns from feedback without depending on ad-hoc heroism or destabilizing our delivery cadence.

### The Mechanism

We have established a 6-step loop (Signal → Interpretation → Decision → Planning → Execution → Verification) that formalizes how we react to trust data.

### Key Controls

1.  **Zero-Sum Discipline**: We do not simply "add" trust fixes to a full plate. Every addition requires a subtraction, ensuring our capacity remains realistic and execution stable.
2.  **Governance Integrity**: Trust fixes are not emergency hacks. They pass the same rigorous OPA policies and graduation gates as feature work.
3.  **Signal Filtering**: We differentiate between "noise" and genuine "trust erosion" to prevent roadmap thrash.

### Outcome

By making trust-driven changes visible and governed, we convert "incidents" into "assets"—improving our system's credibility with every iteration. We are moving from **trust-aware** (watching dashboards) to **trust-driven** (evolving behavior).

Summit is now designed to get smarter and more trustworthy with time.

**Signed,**
Continuous Improvement Systems Owner
