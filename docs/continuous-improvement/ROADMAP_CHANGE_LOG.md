# Roadmap Change Log

This log tracks all roadmap adjustments driven by Trust Signals.

| Date       | Signal Source          | Severity | Added Item          | Removed/Deferred Item  | Rationale                                    |
| :--------- | :--------------------- | :------- | :------------------ | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | [Link to Issue/Ticket] | P0/P1/P2 | [Feature/Fix Added] | [Feature/Epic Removed] | [Why this trade-off increased overall trust] |

## Usage

- This log must be updated whenever a "Trust Signal" alters the committed roadmap.
- It serves as the system of record for the "Zero-Sum Capacity" rule.
