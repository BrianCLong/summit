# POST_LIFE_RISK — Post-Life Risk & Misuse Monitoring

> **Mission:** Ensure Summit is **not resurrected improperly**.

## 1. Risk Landscape

Even after death, the _idea_ or the _code_ of Summit can be dangerous.

### 1.1. Threat Vectors

- **Zombie Forks:** Unauthorized parties spinning up the codebase without the ethical constraints.
- **Brand Hijacking:** Using the "Summit" name to sell inferior or malicious tools.
- **False Provenance:** Forging cryptographic proofs that claim to be from the original Summit ledger.

---

## 2. Monitoring Criteria

The Custodian and allied automated sentinels will monitor for:

### 2.1. Digital Footprint

- **Keyword Scanning:** "Summit Framework", "Summit Provenance", "Summit Fork" on GitHub, GitLab, and dark web forums.
- **Registry Monitoring:** New Docker Hub or PyPI packages claiming Summit lineage.

### 2.2. Cryptographic Anomalies

- **Fake Signatures:** Any appearance of signatures purporting to use the destroyed Root Keys.
- **Ledger Forks:** Attempts to publish competing histories of the `ProvenanceLedger`.

---

## 3. Response Playbooks

### 3.1. The "Disavowal" Protocol

If a Zombie Fork appears:

1.  **Verification:** Confirm the fork is unauthorized.
2.  **Public Notice:** Publish a signed alert to the Memorial Site.
    > "WARNING: The instance at [URL] is NOT the original Summit. It is unverified and potentially unsafe."
3.  **Cryptographic Proof:** Release a specific proof showing the divergence from the canonical chain.

### 3.2. Legal & Institutional Action

- **Cease & Desist:** Issue standard IP takedown notices for trademark infringement (if applicable).
- **Notification:** Inform the Council of Solvers alumni network.

---

## 4. Institutional Notification Paths

- **Global:** UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (if applicable).
- **Regional:** Relevant Cyber Security Agencies (CISA, ENISA).
- **Academic:** Partner Universities holding the Archive.

---

## 5. Long-Term Sentinel

An automated, low-resource script (`sentinel-bot`) will run indefinitely on the Memorial Site server.

- **Function:** Daily check of the `proof-of-death.json` availability.
- **Function:** Weekly search for high-risk keywords.
- **Alerting:** Emails the Custodian if anomalies are found.
