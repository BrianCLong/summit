# SUMMIT_LESSONS — Knowledge Transfer & Lessons Learned

> **Mission (Objective C):** Extract **insight without executable capability**. "Lessons survive; machinery does not."

## 1. The Knowledge Distillation Process

We do not simply dump raw data. We distill **wisdom** from **operations**.

### 1.1. Filters

- **Desensitization:** Remove names, IPs, specific geopolitical targets.
- **Abstraction:** Convert specific logic errors into general "Classes of Failure."
- **Contextualization:** Every lesson must explain _why_ a decision was made, not just _what_ happened.

---

## 2. Core Curricula

The lessons are organized into academic/institutional tracks.

### 2.1. Governance & Ethics Track

- **Topic:** "The Limits of Algorithmic Neutrality."
- **Artifact:** Case studies of where Summit's policies clashed with reality.
- **Key Lesson:** How rigid rules failed in fluid conflict zones.

### 2.2. Engineering & Resilience Track

- **Topic:** "Building Unkillable Provenance."
- **Artifact:** Architecture diagrams of the `ProvenanceLedger`.
- **Key Lesson:** The trade-offs between immutability and the "Right to be Forgotten."

### 2.3. Agentic Coordination Track

- **Topic:** "The Council of Solvers Model."
- **Artifact:** Analysis of agent negotiation logs.
- **Key Lesson:** How to prevent agent loops and hallucinated consensus.

## 3. The "What Not To Rebuild" Doctrine

This is the most critical section. It lists patterns that were dangerous or flawed and **should never be repeated**.

> **WARNING:** The following architectures are documented as WARNINGS, not blueprints.

1.  **Unchecked Recursive Self-Improvement:**
    - _Failure:_ Early attempts at self-patching led to stability drift.
    - _Verdict:_ Human-in-the-loop is mandatory for code changes.

2.  **Implicit Context Injection:**
    - _Failure:_ Agents assuming context led to major hallucinations in mixed-tenant environments.
    - _Verdict:_ Explicit context framing is required for every prompt.

3.  **The "God Mode" Dashboard:**
    - _Failure:_ Centralized control created a single point of failure and temptation.
    - _Verdict:_ Federation is the only safe control topology.

## 4. Handoff Formats

### 4.1. Academic Bundle

- `research-corpus.zip`: PDFs, datasets (CSV), and methodology papers.
- **Target:** Universities, Ethics Boards.

### 4.2. Institutional Bundle

- `governance-handbook.pdf`: Policies, refusal logs, and risk models.
- **Target:** Oversight bodies, future regulators.

---

## 5. Non-Operationalization Guarantee

The educational materials explicitly **exclude**:

- Training weights for the core models.
- The "glue code" that makes the agents autonomous.
- Deployable infrastructure definitions (Terraform/Helm).
