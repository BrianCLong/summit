### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Verify nightly health workflow is scheduled:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow view merge-train-health.yml
   ```
````

2. **Run initial health check:**

   ```bash
   make -f Makefile.merge-train mt-health
   ```

3. **Optional: Configure Slack alerts**
   ```bash
   gh secret set SLACK_MERGE_TRAIN_WEBHOOK --body "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
   ```

### ðŸ“Š First Nightly Report

The first automated health report will run tonight at **02:00 UTC** (~6 PM PT).

**Check it here:**

- Actions tab â†’ Merge Train Health Check workflow
- Artifacts section â†’ `merge-train-health-report-*`
- Issues tab â†’ Look for ðŸš¨ alerts if health <60

### ðŸ“ˆ Baseline Metrics (as of merge)

| Metric        | Current | Target (90d) |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Open PRs      | 343     | <100         |

**Monday (Day 1):** Run triage on 148 conflicting PRs

```bash
make -f Makefile.merge-train mt-triage
```

**Tuesday (Day 2):** Generate hotspot report & update CODEOWNERS

make -f Makefile.merge-train mt-hotspots
# Review /tmp/hotspot-report.csv
# Update .github/CODEOWNERS as needed
```

**Wednesday (Day 3):** Close stale draft PRs

```bash
make -f Makefile.merge-train mt-close-stale

```bash
make -f Makefile.merge-train mt-health
make -f Makefile.merge-train mt-metrics
```

**Friday (Day 5):** Merge ready PRs (express + standard lanes)

```bash
make -f Makefile.merge-train mt-express-lane  # Auto-merge eligible
make -f Makefile.merge-train mt-standard-lane # Review-ready
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "make: command not found"

**Solution:** Use scripts directly:

```bash
./scripts/merge-train-health-dashboard.sh
./scripts/triage-conflicting-prs.sh
```

### "gh: command not found"

**Solution:** Install GitHub CLI:

```bash
brew install gh  # macOS
sudo apt install gh  # Ubuntu
```

### Workflow doesn't trigger

**Solution:** Manually trigger first run:

```bash
gh workflow run merge-train-health.yml
gh run watch  # Monitor progress
```

### Health score always shows critical

**Possible causes:**

- Open PR count is very high (>300)
- Conflict rate is high (>50%)
- Low merge velocity (<5/day)

**Solutions:** Follow Week 1 execution plan above
