# Mecha-Rachkovsky, Mecha-Okhrana, and Mecha-Cheka Educational Prototype Blueprint

**Project Lead:** Historical Codex Integration Initiative  
**Target Launch:** 2026 Digital Codex Conference  
**Initial Concept Package Due:** 19 October 2025

## 1. Vision & Learning Outcomes
- Deliver three archival-focused mecha avatars that operate as interactive docents inside Intelgraph Codex-enabled learning venues (virtual museums, educator-led simulations, and web-based archives).
- Reinforce ethical stewardship of historical knowledge by centering preservation, provenance, and critical analysis of early 20th-century Russian archival practices.
- Provide modular interaction pathways—guided tours, semantic search dialogues, graph-assisted timelines, and quizzes—that adapt to learner personas while remaining culturally sensitive and non-violent.

### Core Learning Objectives
1. Explain how data coordination, preservation, and revolutionary-era documentation evolved between 1880 and 1925.  
2. Demonstrate responsible data ethics, including privacy awareness, source verification, and anti-misinformation protocols.  
3. Encourage participatory archival exploration by connecting learners with historians’ commentary, curated primary sources, and contextual timelines.

## 2. Prototype Profiles

### 2.1 Mecha-Rachkovsky — “Knowledge Nexus Coordinator”
- **Scale & Form:** 1.8 m streamlined humanoid silhouette with luminescent codex glyphs and projected graph nodes orbiting a central “knowledge nexus” core.
- **Primary Function:** Facilitates information synthesis and contextual linking across archival nodes. Users can request semantic comparisons, highlight diplomatic correspondences, or follow data-probe visualizations that trace provenance chains.
- **Signature Interactions:**
  - **Dynamic Graph Weaving:** Intelgraph-powered overlays show relationships among dossiers, correspondents, and geopolitical events.
  - **Curated Dialogues:** Historian-scripted conversations on information coordination ethics, featuring branching prompts tied to verified archival citations.
  - **Analysis Workshops:** Interactive labs where learners assess document credibility using guided checklists and “data probe” annotations.

### 2.2 Mecha-Okhrana — “Custodian of Cultural Records”
- **Scale & Form:** 2.2 m guardian archetype with layered shields that resemble encrypted ledgers and archival lockboxes.
- **Primary Function:** Protects and contextualizes cultural artifacts, emphasizing preservation protocols and respectful display of sensitive materials.
- **Signature Interactions:**
  - **Holographic Knowledge Shields:** Defensive overlays that reveal metadata, conservation histories, and handling requirements when learners interact with artifacts.
  - **Preservation Patrols:** Story-driven walkthroughs illustrating how archivists mitigate degradation, implement redundancy, and document restoration decisions.
  - **Ethics Clinics:** Scenario-based quizzes probing privacy boundaries, cultural considerations, and classification practices, scored with gentle feedback loops.

### 2.3 Mecha-Cheka — “Revolutionary Archivist Curator”
- **Scale & Form:** 2.0 m agile, modular chassis featuring rotating codex wheels, neural filament arms, and adaptable display panels.
- **Primary Function:** Illuminates societal change narratives by linking revolutionary-era documents, personal testimonies, and policy evolutions without glorifying enforcement tactics.
- **Signature Interactions:**
  - **Timeline Loom:** Learners assemble multi-perspective timelines via draggable Intelgraph nodes that highlight cause-and-effect relationships.
  - **Document Assemblies:** Mix-and-match modules invite comparison of primary accounts, encouraging reflection on bias, voice, and omissions.
  - **Reconstruction Studios:** Collaborative workspaces where classes co-create annotated storymaps, supervised by historian-approved prompts.

## 3. Experience Architecture
- **Multi-Modal Delivery:** Support VR installations, 2D web portals, and educator-led projection experiences using responsive UI kits and subtitle/voiceover options.
- **Accessibility Commitments:** WCAG 2.2 AA alignment; customizable text-to-speech, adjustable color contrast, multilingual subtitle packs (EN, RU, FR, ES), and motion-reduction toggles.
- **Soft-Interaction Protocols:** All gestures remain non-contact; avatars use light beams, holograms, or projection pointers. Safety disclaimers emphasize fictional, educational intent.

## 4. Intelgraph Codex Integration
- **Semantic Query Pipeline:**
  - Curated datasets vetted by partner historians; ingestion via Intelgraph Codex connectors with provenance tags and usage rights metadata.
  - Natural-language understanding bound to scripted response trees; no autonomous free-roam exploration beyond approved corpora.
- **Graph Visualization Toolkit:** Utilizes reusable Intelgraph widgets for timeline arcs, relationship matrices, and comparative heatmaps, optimized for low-poly rendering.
- **API Hooks & Telemetry:** Privacy-first interaction logging (session opt-in, anonymized metrics, GDPR-compliant retention). Virtual LIDAR proxies measure spatial proximity solely for interface adjustments.

## 5. Technical Specifications
- **Rendering:** Low-poly meshes (<45k tris per avatar), shared shader library with baked lighting for eco-conscious performance. Target 60 FPS on mid-range WebGL devices.
- **Animation System:** State machine blending for gestural sequences (guidance, acknowledgement, storytelling) sourced from reusable motion-capture clips.
- **AI Runtime:** Intelgraph conversational microservices orchestrated through scripted scenario packs; sandboxed to prevent unsanctioned knowledge claims.
- **Fail-Safes:**
  - Session watchdog monitors latency, gracefully degrades to 2D storyboard mode if performance dips below thresholds.
  - Content filter layer blocks unverified queries, triggers historian escalation queue when learners request sensitive topics.
- **Deployment Targets:** Browser-based WebGL builds, VR lab packages (OpenXR compliant), and lightweight kiosk mode for museums. CDN distribution with asset streaming and offline cache fallbacks.
