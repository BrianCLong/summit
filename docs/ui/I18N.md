# UI Internationalization Guide

This project uses a lightweight, opt-in i18n helper for the legacy `ui/` React components. The goal is to enable incremental adoption without forcing a full migration.

## Current setup

- Locale dictionary: `ui/i18n/en-US.ts` (exported via `translations` in `ui/i18n/index.ts`).
- Helper: `t(key, values?)` returns the localized string and supports `{{placeholder}}` replacement.
- Example component: `ui/components/Switchboard.tsx` now uses `t()` for common UI strings.

## Adding strings

1. Add a key/value to `ui/i18n/en-US.ts`.
2. Use `t('yourKey')` (or `t('yourKey', { name: 'value' })` for interpolation) in JSX.
3. Keep keys stable and descriptive (e.g., `approvalsInboxTitle`).

## Adding locales

1. Create a new file under `ui/i18n/` (e.g., `fr-FR.ts`) that matches the `TranslationKey` shape.
2. Export it and add it to the `translations` map in `ui/i18n/index.ts`.
3. Wire locale selection as needed (no global switch is enforced yet).

## Lint guard

`eslint.config.mjs` includes a targeted rule for `ui/components/Switchboard.tsx` that blocks new user-facing JSX text or placeholders unless they use `t()`. This keeps the component on the i18n path without impacting the rest of the codebase.
