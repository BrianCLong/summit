# Flaky Test Detection and Quarantine Strategy

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the strategy for identifying, managing, and resolving flaky tests within the IntelGraph test suite. Flaky tests are a significant source of developer frustration and can undermine confidence in the CI/CD pipeline.

## 2. Definition of a Flaky Test

A test is considered flaky if it produces different results (pass/fail) for the same code and environment, without any changes to the code under test.

## 3. Detection Mechanisms

*   **Automated Reruns in CI**:
    *   Configure CI jobs to automatically rerun failed tests a fixed number of times (e.g., 3 times).
    *   If a test passes on a rerun after an initial failure, it is flagged as potentially flaky.
*   **Probabilistic Scoring**:
    *   Track the pass/fail history of each test over time.
    *   Assign a "flakiness score" based on the frequency of inconsistent results.
    *   Tests exceeding a certain flakiness threshold are automatically flagged.
*   **Dedicated Flaky Test Runs**:
    *   Periodically run a subset of known flaky tests or all tests multiple times in isolation to confirm flakiness.

## 4. Quarantine Process

*   **Automated Quarantine Label**:
    *   When a test is identified as flaky (e.g., passes on rerun in CI, or exceeds flakiness score), it is automatically moved to a "quarantine" state.
    *   This can involve adding a specific label (e.g., `@flaky`) to the test file or moving it to a dedicated directory.
*   **Exclusion from Main CI**:
    *   Quarantined tests are excluded from the main CI pipeline to prevent them from blocking merges.
    *   They are run in a separate, nightly job.
*   **Notification**:
    *   Relevant teams (e.g., QA, owning team) are notified when a test is quarantined.

## 5. Resolution and Un-Quarantine

*   **Investigation**:
    *   Dedicated engineering time is allocated to investigate the root cause of quarantined flaky tests.
    *   This may involve analyzing logs, reviewing code, or reproducing the flakiness locally.
*   **Fix and Verify**:
    *   Once the root cause is identified and fixed, the test is updated.
    *   The fix is verified by running the test multiple times in isolation.
*   **Nightly Attempt to Un-Quarantine**:
    *   Quarantined tests are automatically attempted to be un-quarantined in a nightly job. If they pass consistently for a period (e.g., 7 consecutive runs), they are moved back to the main test suite.
*   **Manual Intervention**:
    *   If a test remains flaky after multiple investigation attempts, a ticket is created for manual review and potential re-design or removal.

## 6. Reporting and Metrics

*   **Flakiness Dashboard**:
    *   Visualize the number of flaky tests, their flakiness score, and trends over time.
    *   Track the time tests spend in quarantine.
*   **CI Reporting**:
    *   Test results (including flaky tests) are reported to `test-results/` with trend charts.
    *   Integrate with reporting tools (e.g., Allure, TestRail) for detailed analysis.
