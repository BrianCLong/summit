Public evidence links several vendors and contractors to state-run PSYOPS programs, especially through documented contracts, investigative journalism, and academic analyses. The most prominent connections referenced in open sources are:

## Cambridge Analytica & SCL Group

- **Cambridge Analytica (CA)** and its parent **SCL Group** are directly documented as private sector vendors for military and government psychological operations.[1]
- SCL Group ran contracts for the British Foreign Office, US agencies (including Department of Defense-related work), the Norwegian Defense Research Agency, Saudi Arabia, and the British Army’s Psychological Operations Group.[1]
- Sandia National Laboratories (linked with the Pentagon) collaborated with SCL on behavior change and extremism studies, confirmed by internal documentation.[1]
- These companies' original business models privatized military-grade psychological warfare and behavioral analysis tools, with multiple operations later exposed as state-backed influence campaigns.[2][1]

## Major Tech Companies (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI)

- In July 2025, the Pentagon publicly announced contracts up to $200 million each for Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI (Elon Musk) to "expand military use of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities" including agentic AI workflows for intelligence, information, and campaigning missions.[3]
- xAI unveiled "Grok for Government," a government-targeted AI production line after its contract.[3]
- While not all details specify direct PSYOPS, the stated remit covers national security and influence operations, consistent with PSYOPS goals.[4][3]

## TurbineOne

- The U.S. Army contracted TurbineOne ($98.9M) for battlefield AI, including tools that enable operational units to process, identify, and potentially craft influence content even in signal-dense or denied environments—coinciding with contemporary AI-driven PSYOPS training and doctrine.[5]

## Social Media Platform Leaks and Investigations

- Stanford Internet Observatory and Meta (Facebook) exposed five years of covert influence campaigns run by U.S. military and its contractors using fake social media accounts. Specific disclosures name the use of commercial influence platforms for Central Asia and the Middle East messaging, directly tying "portions" of the operation to vendors working for state-run PSYOPS.[6][2]

## Deepfake & Influence Tech for DoD

- Army special operations units and contractors have openly demonstrated use of “Ghost Machine,” a deepfake and drone platform for information warfare training, confirming sophisticated tech vendors support active measures and cognitive campaigns for military clients.[7]

These sources provide strong public evidence that both traditional military contractors and leading tech/AI firms are directly involved in developing and executing state-run psychological operations, both overt and covert, through contract data, leaked internal documents, and program announcements.[6][2][4][7][5][3][1]
