### Context

Source: Internal research summary from AryaX AI labs on "Mixture of Reasonings" (MoR) two-phase reasoning distillation framework.
Excerpt/why: Product teams need an adaptive training recipe that fuses multiple reasoning styles into a single model, eliminating brittle prompt engineering dependencies while keeping agents general-purpose.

### Problem / Goal

Large language models today frequently depend on brittle, prompt-level heuristics to switch between reasoning behaviors (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-critique, tool planning). This leads to task-specific templates, higher operational costs, and poor generalization. The goal is to implement Mixture of Reasonings (MoR), a two-phase teacher-student training framework that embeds a diverse set of reasoning strategies directly into model weights so agents can fluidly adapt to new tasks without prompt juggling.

### Proposed Approach

- Phase 1 (Teacher strategy synthesis):
  - Curate a bank of reasoning experts (chain-of-thought, decomposition, planning, reflective critique, tool-use orchestration).
  - Use the teacher model to generate paired reasoning traces per task, labeling strategy metadata and performance metrics.
  - Score strategies with reward models capturing accuracy, safety, latency, and downstream cost.
- Phase 2 (Student distillation & policy fusion):
  - Train the student model with multi-objective distillation that conditions on the strategy metadata while learning to predict final answers.
  - Introduce a gating controller that mixes strategies by context, optimizing for adaptive selection during inference without external prompts.
  - Reinforce the distilled policy with self-play evaluations and targeted curriculum refreshes to prevent catastrophic forgetting.
- Platform integration:
  - Extend orchestration pipelines to schedule teacher runs, trace storage, and student fine-tuning jobs.
  - Ship evaluation harnesses that compare MoR-enabled models against prompt-engineered baselines across representative tasks.

### Tasks

- [ ] Define the taxonomy of reasoning strategies and success metrics with responsible AI review.
- [ ] Build the teacher trace generation pipeline with strategy tagging and telemetry capture.
- [ ] Implement the student distillation training loop with strategy-aware conditioning and gating controller.
- [ ] Integrate MoR artifacts (traces, checkpoints, metrics) into model registry and provenance ledger.
- [ ] Automate evaluation suites covering task adaptation, safety regression, and inference cost.
- [ ] Document MoR operational playbooks for data refresh, drift monitoring, and rollback.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Teacher pipeline produces labeled multi-strategy traces with ≥95% telemetry completeness and passes safety audits.
- Student model demonstrates ≥12% average accuracy uplift versus prompt-engineered baseline across benchmark tasks while reducing prompt template count by ≥80%.
- Adaptive gating selects at least three distinct reasoning strategies in live A/B trials with <5% latency regression.
- Evaluation harness reports and dashboards are available in observability stack with drill-down per strategy.
- Comprehensive runbooks exist for retraining, rollback, and anomaly handling.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: TRAIN (model fine-tuning) and READ (strategy telemetry).
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: RA-Model-Training, RA-Trace-Audit.
- Requires human-in-the-loop review for any newly introduced reasoning expert prior to production rollout.

### Dependencies

- Depends on: Expanded reward modeling (#reward-modeling-refresh), observability upgrades (#observability-mor), storage quota increase for trace artifacts (#storage-scale-out).
- Blocks: General-purpose agent release milestone, adaptive routing upgrades.

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Strategy taxonomy ratified, teacher compute budget allocated, safety guardrails approved.
- DOD: Student checkpoints promoted to staging with passing evaluations, observability dashboards operational, runbooks published.
