# Feature engineering

The service exposes a `/feature/build` endpoint that currently computes
node degree features from an edge list. Example request:

```json
{
  "edges": [
    ["a", "b"],
    ["b", "c"],
    ["c", "a"]
  ]
}
```

The response includes each node and its degree:

```json
{
  "features": [
    { "node": "a", "degree": 2 },
    { "node": "b", "degree": 2 },
    { "node": "c", "degree": 2 }
  ]
}
```

Additional feature builders will extend this module as the analytics
stack matures.
