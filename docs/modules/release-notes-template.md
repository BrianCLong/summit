# IntelGraph Safe Mutations – Canary GA Release Notes

**Release Version**: v2.1.0  
**Release Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Release Type**: Major Feature - GA Promotion  
**Risk Level**: Medium (Canary → Production)

## 🚀 **What's New**

### Safe Mutations Framework (Canary → GA)
IntelGraph now enforces comprehensive budget controls and approval workflows for all mutation operations, promoted from canary testing to general availability.

#### **Persisted Queries Enforcement**
- **Phase**: `enforce` (previously `log`) 
- All GraphQL mutations now require pre-approved persisted query hashes
- Emergency bypass disabled (`PQ_BYPASS=0`) for production security
- Introspection queries blocked (`PQ_INTROSPECTION=0`) to prevent schema discovery

#### **Budget Controls & Limits**
- **Canary Tenants**: Daily caps enforced at $25, monthly at $750
- **Auto-Escalation**: Clean tenants auto-promote to $50 daily/$1,500 monthly after 7 days
- **Real-time Enforcement**: Mutations blocked when budget exceeded
- **Reconciliation**: Daily spend calculated and reconciled via BullMQ workers

#### **Four-Eyes Approval System**
Default approval required for:
- **Risk Tags**: `destructive`, `bulk_delete`, `merge_entities`, `purge`, `cross_tenant_move`, `bulk_update`, `schema_change`, `data_export`
- **Cost Threshold**: Operations estimated >$5 USD
- **Approval Flow**: Requires 2+ approver IDs in mutation variables
- **OPA Policy**: Centralized approval logic with signed bundles

#### **Observability & Monitoring**
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Budget utilization, SLO tracking, canary health
- **SLOs Defined**: Budget latency (<30ms p95), reconciliation freshness (95% <24h)
- **Alerting**: Canary budget approaching (80%), exceeded (100%), approval bottlenecks
- **Audit Logging**: Full trail of budget decisions, overrides, and approvals

## 📊 **Impact & Metrics**

### Pre-GA Canary Results (30-day window)
- **Tenants Tested**: `demo`, `test`, `maestro-internal`  
- **Mutation Volume**: 45,000+ operations  
- **False Positive Rate**: 0.03% (well below 0.1% SLO)  
- **Budget Accuracy**: 99.7% spend estimation accuracy  
- **Latency Impact**: +12ms p95 (within 30ms SLO)  
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime maintained  

### Expected Production Impact
- **Mutation Latency**: +10-15ms average (budget validation overhead)
- **Approval Friction**: ~5% of mutations require four-eyes (high-risk operations)
- **Cost Visibility**: 100% mutation cost attribution and tracking
- **Risk Reduction**: 90%+ reduction in uncontrolled/destructive operations

## 🔧 **Operations Changes**

### Required Actions for Ops Team
- [ ] **Verify Alert Configuration**: Confirm Grafana panels show canary data, alerts active
- [ ] **Review Daily FinOps Report**: Check CI artifact generation and email delivery
- [ ] **Test Emergency Procedures**: Validate rollback plan and emergency overrides
- [ ] **Update Runbooks**: Ensure on-call pager links to budget/rollback playbooks

### New Runbooks Available
- 📋 **Go/No-Go Checklist**: `ops/go-no-go-checklist.md`
- 🔄 **Rollback Plan**: `docs/runbooks/rollback-plan.md`  
- 📈 **SLO Monitoring**: `ops/slos-and-alerts.yaml`
- 🧪 **Smoke Tests**: `ops/post-deploy-smoke-tests.sh`

### Monitoring & Alerts
```bash
# Post-deploy verification
./ops/post-deploy-smoke-tests.sh

# Budget health check  
curl -s "$API/health/budget" | jq '.status'

# Canary utilization check
curl -s "$API/admin/budget/status" | jq '.canary_tenants[]'
```

## 🚨 **Rollback Procedures**

### Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Feature flag emergency bypass (use sparingly)
kubectl set env deployment/intelgraph-api PQ_PHASE=log PQ_BYPASS=1

# OPA policy override (2-hour TTL)
curl -X PUT "$OPA_BUNDLE_URL/emergency-override" -d @ops/emergency-bundle.tar.gz
```

### Controlled Rollback Options
1. **Policy Softening**: Raise canary budgets +20%, disable four-eyes for <$10 ops
2. **Blue-Green Switch**: Revert to previous deployment, drain worker queues
3. **Data Recovery**: Compensation log replay for last 50 operations if needed

### Rollback Decision Matrix
| **Scenario** | **Action** | **Approval** | **Timeline** |
|--------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| High latency (>100ms p95) | Feature flag bypass | Engineering Manager | < 5 min |
| Budget calculation errors | Policy override | FinOps + Engineering | < 10 min |  
| False positive denials >1% | Deployment rollback | Principal Engineer | < 15 min |
| Complete system failure | Full rollback + data recovery | Incident Commander | < 30 min |

## 🔒 **Security & Compliance**

### Security Enhancements
- **Persisted Allowlist**: Cryptographically signed, managed via CI artifacts
- **PII Redaction**: Raw prompts blocked from logging outside canary tenants
- **RBAC Enforcement**: Admin overrides restricted to "FinOps Admin" role only
- **Audit Immutability**: All policy decisions logged with correlation IDs

### Compliance Impact
- **SOC2 Controls**: Enhanced change management and approval workflows  
- **Financial Controls**: Real-time budget enforcement and reconciliation
- **Data Governance**: Improved mutation tracking and cost attribution
- **Risk Management**: Four-eyes controls for high-risk operations

## 🐛 **Known Issues & Workarounds**

### Issue 1: Persisted Query Hash Drift
**Symptom**: New client deployments fail with "hash not found" errors  
**Workaround**: Ensure CI pipeline updates Redis allowlist before client deploy  
**Fix**: Automated PQ hash sync planned for v2.1.1  

### Issue 2: Estimator Accuracy for Graph Operations  
**Symptom**: Neo4j relationship traversals occasionally underestimated  
**Impact**: 3-5% of graph mutations may hit budget limits sooner than expected  
**Workaround**: Manual budget increase for graph-heavy workloads  
**Fix**: Enhanced cost modeling in development  

### Issue 3: Four-Eyes Bottleneck During Peak Hours
**Symptom**: Approval backlogs during business hours (9-11am EST)  
**Mitigation**: Auto-escalation to manager approval after 30min delay  
**Monitoring**: `ApprovalBottleneck` alert fires at 50+ pending approvals
