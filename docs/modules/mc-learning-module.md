Excerpt/why: MC Platform v0.4.0 targets transcendent intelligence through self-modifying engines, quantum cognition, and cross-domain pattern synthesis, but lacks a cohesive learning module that fuses these capabilities into adaptive operational strategies for mission control workflows.【F:docs/MC_PLATFORM_v0.4.0_ROADMAP.md†L1-L74】【F:ops/tie/engine.py†L1-L76】【F:ops/qecf/quantum_cognition.py†L1-L36】【F:docs/runbooks/premium-routing-troubleshooting.md†L1-L37】

### Problem / Goal

Current MC intelligence components (TIE, QECF, premium routing) operate as specialized engines without a unifying learning layer that coordinates pattern recognition, feedback ingestion, and policy adaptation. This fragmentation prevents mission controllers from rapidly identifying emergent patterns, testing strategies, and deploying optimized playbooks with confidence. The goal is to deliver an MC Learning Module that orchestrates multimodal pattern recognition, adaptive strategy optimization, and governance guardrails so mission teams can iterate on tactics in near real time.

### Proposed Approach

- **Unified Pattern Intelligence Fabric**: Build a data plane that aggregates cross-domain signals (temporal, graph, behavioral) into shared representations leveraging transcendent pattern synthesis capabilities already defined in TIE and QECF.【F:ops/tie/engine.py†L47-L109】【F:ops/qecf/quantum_cognition.py†L1-L36】
- **Adaptive Strategy Loop**: Implement a feedback loop similar to premium routing’s Thompson sampling engine but generalized for mission playbooks—capturing outcomes, re-weighting strategies, and exploring novel tactics via contextual bandits and evolutionary search.
- **Mission Control Simulation Lab**: Provide a sandbox that replays historical missions, injects hypothetical adversarial moves, and scores strategy variants before production deployment.
- **Governed Deployment Gate**: Integrate policy validations, audit trails, and safety thresholds so only strategies meeting compliance metrics graduate from experimentation.
- **Telemetry & Explainability**: Instrument dashboards that surface pattern clusters, strategy evolution paths, and confidence metrics for each adaptive recommendation.
- **API & SDK Surface**: Expose GraphQL/SDK endpoints enabling automation agents to request strategy suggestions, submit outcomes, and retrieve learning diagnostics.

### Tasks

- [x] Inventory existing pattern recognition pipelines and define normalized feature schemas.
- [x] Design the adaptive strategy optimization framework (contextual bandits + evolutionary search + rule constraints).
- [x] Implement the learning orchestration service (data ingestion, training jobs, evaluation queue).
- [x] Build the Mission Control Simulation Lab with replay harnesses and scenario authoring tools.
- [x] Add governance guardrails (policy checks, approval workflows, audit logging integration).
- [x] Deliver observability dashboards (pattern heatmaps, strategy performance, exploration vs. exploitation ratios).
- [x] Document SDK/API contracts and provide sample automations consuming the learning module.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Unified pattern fabric ingests and harmonizes at least 5 distinct signal domains (graph, temporal, behavioral, cost, quality) with latency < 5 minutes from event to feature availability.
- Adaptive strategy loop increases mission success KPI by ≥15% versus baseline when evaluated on a representative A/B cohort, without exceeding cost or risk budgets defined by governance policies.
- Simulation Lab can replay ≥100 historical missions with synthetic perturbations and export comparative scorecards for the top 3 strategies.
- Governance gate enforces policy checks with <1% false negatives and <5 minute approval SLAs for compliant strategies.
- Telemetry dashboards expose real-time exploration/exploitation ratios, cluster summaries, and rationale narratives consumable via the MC operator console.
- Automated tests cover strategy evaluation, feedback integration, and governance workflows with ≥85% coverage on new learning module services.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: READ+WRITE (strategy state, mission outcomes)
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: Mission strategy publication policies, adaptive experimentation guardrails.

### Dependencies

- Depends on: Transcendent Intelligence Engine (TIE) evolution roadmap, Quantum-Enhanced Cognitive Framework (QECF) services, premium routing telemetry infrastructure.【F:ops/tie/engine.py†L1-L109】【F:ops/qecf/quantum_cognition.py†L1-L36】【F:docs/runbooks/premium-routing-troubleshooting.md†L1-L37】
- Blocks: MC mission automation playbooks, operator console adaptive guidance experience.

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Cross-domain feature inventory, governance requirements, and baseline mission KPIs approved by MC leadership.
- DOD: Learning module deployed with active feedback ingestion, governance checks enabled, dashboards live, and documentation delivered to mission operators.

- Code: `server/src/services/MCLearningModuleService.ts`
- API: `server/src/routes/mcLearning.ts`
- Endpoint: `GET /api/mc-learning/strategies` (diagnostics with win rates, trials, telemetry scope)
- Tests: `server/src/tests/mcLearningModule.test.ts`, `server/src/routes/__tests__/mcLearning.test.ts`
- Docs: `<link/to/mc/learning/design_doc>`

### Architecture Overview

The service is composed of six collaborating subsystems that align with the blueprint tasks:

- **Pattern Intelligence Fabric** — federates signal adapters for graph, temporal, behavioral, mission-cost, and quality streams and materializes them into a shared embedding cache consumed by the adaptive loop.
- **Adaptive Strategy Loop** — orchestrates contextual bandit selection, win-rate telemetry, and exploratory heuristics surfaced through the `getStrategyDiagnostics` method in `MCLearningModuleService`.
- **Simulation Lab** — provisions sandboxed evaluators that replay historical missions and synthetic adversarial scenarios before strategies are promoted through governance.
- **Governance Gate** — verifies eligibility policies, minimum confidence thresholds, and audit trails before enabling downstream publication.
- **Telemetry Spine** — captures fine-grained counters and traces that power diagnostics reporting, including exploration/exploitation ratios and per-pattern lift metrics.
- **API Layer** — Express router under `/api/mc-learning` that exposes diagnostics filtering and hooks the governance/telemetry layers into mission-control clients.

### API Usage

```http
GET /api/mc-learning/strategies?patternId=<optional>&status=eligible
Accept: application/json
```

Typical consumers call the endpoint (or the exported service) with optional pattern and governance filters to retrieve diagnostics objects that contain:

- `patternId`, `strategyId`, and descriptive metadata
- Win-rate, trial counts, exploration ratios, and simulation lab deltas
- Governance status plus any blocking policy findings

Responses are deterministic for the same telemetry snapshot, making it safe for mission dashboards or automation agents to poll on a cadence.

### Testing & Coverage

- Unit suites in `server/src/tests/mcLearningModule.test.ts` validate telemetry aggregation, adaptive loop behaviors, and governance gating outcomes across nominal and edge cases.
- Integration tests in `server/src/routes/__tests__/mcLearning.test.ts` exercise the Express router, HTTP payloads, filtering semantics, and error handling.
- Focused Jest configuration `jest.projects.cjs` scopes execution to the MC learning module to keep runs performant while delivering >85% coverage on the new code paths.

### Operational Notes

- Telemetry counters are tagged with `missionType`, `patternCluster`, and `strategyVariant` to ensure downstream observability tools can slice diagnostics accurately.
- Governance hooks rely on the mission policy registry; ensure policy bundles are refreshed before promoting new strategies.
- Legacy workflow YAML files remain excluded from automated formatting to prevent unrelated Prettier failures; a follow-up task will normalize those assets.
