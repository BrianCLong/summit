# Developer Experience Audit – Maestro Platform

## Audit Scope
- CLI workflows (`tools/deploy`, `tools/ai_*`, `maestro` scripts).
- Portal UI modules (tri-pane control center, canvas, control matrix).
- Documentation touchpoints in `docs/modules`, `docs/platform`, and onboarding playbooks.

## Findings
1. **Fragmented Golden Paths** – Multiple conflicting runbooks for pipeline onboarding. Developers guess between CLI scripts and UI flows.
2. **Limited Contextual Guidance** – UI lacks inline recommendations on policy, guardrails, or deployment readiness.
3. **Telemetry Blind Spots** – No DX sentiment or friction telemetry captured at task boundaries; CLI commands exit silently.
4. **Enablement Debt** – Persona-specific journeys (feature dev vs. SRE) are undocumented, leading to repeated onboarding sessions.
5. **Feedback Loop Gaps** – Incident retrospectives not fed back into developer workflows or golden path updates.

## Remediation Objectives
- Consolidate golden paths per persona with authoritative runbooks.
- Embed AI copilots that use the orchestration knowledge graph to contextualize actions.
- Instrument CLI/UI flows to capture latency, failure reason, and satisfaction pulses.
- Establish telemetry pipelines feeding `observability/dx-metrics` dashboards.
- Provide change management kits and enablement playbooks for rollout.

## KPIs
- Onboarding time to first deployment < 2 days (currently 5 days).
- CLI command satisfaction rating ≥ 4.2/5 measured via inline surveys.
- Reduction in policy violations triggered by developers by 50% due to proactive hints.
- Golden path adherence tracked via knowledge graph events hitting ≥ 80% by end of next quarter.
