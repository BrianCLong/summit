### Context

Source: `docs/CONDUCTOR_PRD_v1.0.md`, `docs/ChatOps/intel_graph_front_end_product_specification_v_1.md`, `docs/ChatOps/intel_graph_frontend_rebuild_maturity_spec_v_1.md`, `docs/ChatOps/intel_graph_frontend_rebuild_roadmap_spec_v_1.md`, `docs/ChatOps/intel_graph_ga_phase_1_master_implementation_prompt_for_the_dev_team.md`, `client/tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts`
Excerpt/why: The project explicitly targets WCAG 2.1 AA and WCAG 2.2 AAA compliance for the UI. This includes keyboard-first navigation, screen reader support, visual accessibility, and automated/manual testing. Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of user experience and a critical compliance requirement.

### Problem / Goal

The current UI may not fully adhere to WCAG AAA accessibility standards, potentially excluding users with disabilities and creating compliance risks. Without a dedicated effort, accessibility gaps can accumulate, making the system difficult or impossible for some users to operate. The goal is to implement comprehensive UI accessibility, ensuring all critical flows and components meet WCAG 2.2 AAA guidelines.

### Proposed Approach

- **WCAG Compliance:** Target WCAG 2.2 AAA for all new UI development and audit existing components against these guidelines.
- **Keyboard-First Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard, including a command palette and intuitive shortcuts.
- **Screen Reader Support:** Implement proper ARIA roles, labels, and live regions to provide meaningful context for screen reader users. Develop screen reader narratives for complex visualizations (graph, timeline, map).
- **Visual Accessibility:** Provide high-contrast themes, reduced motion options, and ensure sufficient color contrast (≥ 4.5:1) for all UI elements.
- **Automated Testing:** Integrate `axe-core` scans into the CI/CD pipeline to catch automatically detectable accessibility violations on every commit.
- **Manual Audits:** Conduct regular manual accessibility audits for complex UI components, especially interactive visualizations, using assistive technologies.
- **Component Library:** Ensure all components in the design system are built with accessibility in mind, providing a11y-compliant primitives and patterns.

### Tasks

- [ ] Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit of the existing UI against WCAG 2.2 AAA guidelines.
- [ ] Prioritize and remediate identified accessibility violations, starting with critical and serious issues.
- [ ] Implement keyboard-first navigation for all core workflows and components.
- [ ] Develop and integrate screen reader narratives for graph, timeline, and map visualizations.
- [ ] Implement high-contrast and reduced-motion themes.
- [ ] Configure `axe-core` as a mandatory CI gate for all frontend code.
- [ ] Establish a process for regular manual accessibility audits.
- [ ] Update component library guidelines to enforce a11y-by-design principles.

### Acceptance Criteria

- All critical user flows are fully operable without a mouse.
- Automated `axe-core` scans pass with zero serious/critical violations on all audited pages.
- Manual audits confirm effective screen reader support and keyboard navigation for complex visualizations.
- Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 95 for all key user journeys.
- Metrics/SLO: Number of WCAG violations = 0 for AAA criteria on critical paths; keyboard navigation coverage > 95%.
- Tests: `jest-axe` for component tests; Playwright E2E tests with `axe-playwright` for critical flows.
- Observability: N/A (accessibility is primarily a testing and design concern).

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: N/A (UI/UX improvement)
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

- Depends on: #<id_of_ci_cd_issue>, #<id_of_test_packs_issue>
- Blocks: Full production readiness and broad user adoption.

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Accessibility strategy and audit plan approved.
- DOD: Merged, all automated and manual accessibility tests passing, documentation updated with a11y guidelines.
