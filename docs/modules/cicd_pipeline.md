### Context

Source: `Autonomous Build Operator â€” Full Roadmap & Tuning Guide`
Excerpt/why: To safely and reliably deploy autonomously generated code, we need a robust CI/CD pipeline that includes quality gates, temporary preview environments, and progressive delivery strategies like canary releases.

### Problem / Goal

The current deployment process is manual and lacks safety checks. There is no automated way to preview changes in an isolated environment or to gradually roll out new versions to production. The goal is to build a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment process and includes gates for quality, ephemeral preview environments, and support for canary deployments and automated rollbacks.

### Proposed Approach

- Integrate with the existing CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions) to trigger the pipeline on every commit to the main branch.
- The pipeline will run a series of quality gates, including linting, unit tests, and integration tests.
- If the gates pass, the pipeline will build a new version of the application and deploy it to a new, isolated, ephemeral environment.
- An automated smoke test will run against the ephemeral environment.
- If the smoke test passes, the new version will be deployed as a canary to a small subset of production traffic.
- The canary will be monitored for errors and performance regressions. If it is healthy, traffic will be gradually shifted to the new version. If not, the pipeline will automatically roll back to the previous version.

### Tasks

- [ ] Create a GitHub Actions workflow for the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Add steps for linting, unit tests, and integration tests.
- [ ] Implement scripting to provision and tear down ephemeral environments (e.g., using Kubernetes or a cloud provider's services).
- [ ] Implement the canary deployment logic (e.g., using a service mesh like Istio or a load balancer).
- [ ] Implement automated rollbacks based on canary health checks.
- [ ] Document the CI/CD pipeline and how to interpret its results.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a code change is merged to main, the CI/CD pipeline is automatically triggered.
- If any quality gate fails, the pipeline stops and the deployment is aborted.
- A successful pipeline results in the creation of an ephemeral environment with the new code.
- A successful canary deployment gradually shifts traffic to the new version without causing errors.
- If a canary deployment fails, the system automatically rolls back to the previous stable version.
- Metrics/SLO: Deployment frequency should be at least once per day; change failure rate < 15%.
- Tests: The pipeline itself should be tested to ensure it correctly handles both successful and failed deployments.
- Observability: Dashboards to monitor the health of canaries and the status of the CI/CD pipeline.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: The pipeline must have permission to deploy to the different environments.

### Dependencies

- Depends on: #<id_of_observability_issue>
- Blocks: Fully autonomous deployments.

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: CI/CD pipeline design and canary strategy approved.
- DOD: Merged, pipeline is fully operational, runbook updated with deployment procedures.
