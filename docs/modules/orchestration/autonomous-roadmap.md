# Autonomous Operational Control Plane Roadmap

## Target Benchmarks
- **Throughput:** ≥ 250 orchestrated workflows/sec sustained with p99 latency < 850 ms (Temporal/Netflix Maestro parity).
- **Durability:** Zero data loss on control-plane failover; cross-region replication RPO ≤ 30 seconds.
- **Self-Healing SLA:** > 90% of critical incidents mitigated autonomously within 120 seconds.
- **Compliance Drift:** Automated detection and remediation of policy drift within 15 minutes.

## Capability Tracks
1. **Event-Driven Runtime Evolution**
   - Adopt streaming command bus with idempotent workflow execution.
   - Implement deterministic replay ledger referencing knowledge graph identifiers.
2. **Policy-Driven Automation Engine**
   - Embed policy packs (`policy/packs/autonomy`) for IaC, Zero Trust, and compliance checks.
   - Provide sandboxed rehearsal mode before applying remediations to production tenants.
3. **Closed-Loop Self-Healing**
   - Detect drift via `runtime/observers` -> evaluate policies -> trigger remediation runbooks -> verify outcomes.
   - Maintain simulation harness (`ops/simulations`) with chaos injection and canary scoring.
4. **Adaptive Cost & Capacity Governance**
   - Link Cost Guard telemetry into orchestration decisions to enforce budget-aware autonomy.
   - Forecast capacity using knowledge graph historical edges and environment saturation.
5. **Reliability Telemetry & Dashboards**
   - Expand `observability/dx-metrics` for DX & SRE visibility.
   - Provide release readiness scorecards with predictive risk overlays.

## Milestones
| Quarter | Deliverable | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q2 | Runtime Benchmark Harness | Synthetic load generator + regression gate for throughput/latency objectives. |
| Q2 | Policy Autonomy Pack v1 | Guardrails for infrastructure drift, identity posture, and data residency. |
| Q3 | Self-Healing Pipelines GA | Production rollout of closed-loop remediation with audit trails. |
| Q3 | Predictive Release Readiness | Risk scoring aggregator feeding into conductor dashboards. |
| Q4 | Adaptive Cost Governance | Autonomous scaling and throttling informed by Cost Guard telemetry. |
| Q4 | Compliance Provenance Export | Signed attestation bundle referencing knowledge graph snapshots. |

## Governance
- Architecture review board meets bi-weekly; decisions logged in `governance/adr/`.
- Quality gates: Vitest suites (`maestro-conductor`, `meta-orchestrator`, `knowledge-graph`), synthetic chaos tests, and compliance scans.
- Risk register maintained in `docs/programs/mc-transformation.md` with mitigation playbooks.
