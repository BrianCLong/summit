# AI-Orchestrator Capability Assessment

## Current Telemetry & Knowledge Assets
- **Meta Orchestrator Signals:** Pricing feeds, reward updates, execution traces. Rich throughput/cost metrics exist but lack lineage tagging and environment context.
- **Maestro Conductor Signals:** Health snapshots, anomaly alerts, remediation plans. No unified schema across discovery, health, and optimization subsystems.
- **Policy Engine Records:** Governance rules for data residency, risk classifications, and workload guardrails. Lacks fine-grained incident binding and audit event streaming.
- **Cost Guard Metrics:** Budget enforcement counters, throttle decisions, and slow query registry that remain siloed from orchestration planning.

## Gap Analysis
| Domain | Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Telemetry Fusion | No shared identifiers across pipelines, services, environments, and incidents. | High – prevents AI copilots from reasoning about blast radius or compliance posture. | Establish orchestration knowledge graph keyed by `serviceId`, `environmentId`, and `pipelineStageId`.
| Intent Understanding | Generative copilots produce free-form suggestions without validation against policy or runtime capacity. | High – risk of unauthorized operations or rollbacks without safeguards. | Introduce intent-to-action translators that enforce policy, capacity, and rollback templates.
| Predictive Insights | Anomaly signals reactive; no forward-looking risk scoring or release readiness heuristics. | Medium | Blend historical incident frequency, cost guard saturation, and environment drift into predictive scoring pipeline.
| Safety & Auditability | AI-suggested actions bypass human approvals and do not emit structured audit trails. | High | Wrap all AI actions with guardrail evaluation, approval queue, and immutable ledger entries.
| DX Surfacing | Insights are not exposed within developer CLI/UI flows; limited golden path guidance. | Medium | Integrate copilots into portal/CLI with contextual insights and telemetry feedback loops.

## Priority Opportunities
1. **Knowledge Graph Foundation** – unify all orchestration assets for AI reasoning, impact analysis, and compliance proof.
2. **Generative Action Guardrails** – convert intents into executable plans with policy gating, approvals, and deterministic rollback playbooks.
3. **Predictive Autonomy Loop** – augment Maestro with drift detection, cost-capacity awareness, and simulated remediation rehearsal.
4. **Developer Experience Copilot** – deliver inline insights, policy hints, and post-action surveys for continuous DX telemetry.

## Success Metrics
- AI action plans meet guardrail compliance ≥ 99% without manual rework.
- Time-to-detect risky deployments reduced by 60% through predictive insights.
- Developer survey toil index decreases by 30% within two release cycles.
- Audit trail completeness of AI-generated operations maintains 100% retention over 12 months.
