# Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT)

## Overview

Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT) is an ultra-lightweight LLM adaptation strategy that concentrates updates on the network's most impactful representation units. By isolating and adjusting only the activations that have outsized influence on downstream reasoning, teams can deliver targeted quality gains without paying the cost of full-model training.

## Key Capabilities

- **Focused parameter updates**: Restricts gradient application to a compact subset of critical units, typically around 0.016% of the total parameters, slashing the compute required for each iteration.
- **Reasoning uplift**: Demonstrates up to 16% improvements on complex reasoning and planning benchmarks thanks to sharper internal representations and reduced interference from untouched weights.
- **Deployment efficiency**: Minimizes memory deltas, accelerates fine-tuning cycles, and reduces inference regression risk, enabling rapid specialization for production workloads.

## Implementation Notes

- Instrument representation probes or attribution tooling to identify the neurons and attention heads that have the largest causal contribution to reasoning-specific outputs.
- Freeze non-critical layers and route optimizer steps exclusively to the selected units using parameter masks or adapter-style modules.
- Track evaluation metrics continuously to validate that localized updates maintain stability while delivering the expected reasoning performance lift.
- Package the resulting weight deltas separately so deployments can toggle CRFT enhancements without duplicating the full base model artifact.
