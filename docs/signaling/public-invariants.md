# Public Invariants Charter

**Principle**: Predictability Is the Strongest Form of Trust

## Overview

Public invariants are **non-negotiable commitments** that Summit makes openly and maintains regardless of external pressure, operational convenience, or competitive dynamics.

These invariants are:
- **Permanent**: Not subject to routine policy changes
- **Observable**: Can be verified through behavior and audit
- **Foundational**: Core to Summit's purpose and legitimacy
- **Non-tactical**: Don't reveal exploitable implementation details

## Why Invariants Matter

In adversarial environments, actors probe for inconsistency. They test boundaries, escalate pressure, and exploit perceived gaps between stated policy and actual behavior.

**Invariants defend against this by:**
- Removing negotiation surface area
- Making behavior predictable across contexts
- Creating verifiable commitments that build long-term trust
- Demonstrating seriousness through constraint

> "What never changes is more credible than what is promised."

## Summit's Public Invariants

### Invariant 1: Evidence Discipline

**Commitment**: High-stakes decisions require explicit evidence citations with provenance.

**Observable Manifestation**:
- Decision explanations include source references
- Evidence quality is evaluable
- Gaps in evidence trigger escalation or deferral

**What This Does NOT Commit**:
- Specific evidence thresholds (internal)
- Citation scoring mechanisms (internal)
- Sources used for detection vs. justification (internal)

**Why This Is Invariant**:
- Central to Summit's purpose as an evidence-based system
- Prevents "trust me" governance
- Enables external verification

---

### Invariant 2: Refusal Under Uncertainty

**Commitment**: Summit refuses to act when evidence is insufficient, contradictory, or stale—even under pressure for decisiveness.

**Observable Manifestation**:
- Explicit "insufficient evidence" responses
- No forced decisions when confidence is low
- Deferrals are documented, not hidden

**What This Does NOT Commit**:
- Exact confidence thresholds (internal)
- How uncertainty is calculated (internal)
- Trade-offs between precision and recall (internal)

**Why This Is Invariant**:
- Prevents mission creep into unreliable operation
- Distinguishes Summit from "move fast and break things" systems
- Protects against pressure to lower standards

---

### Invariant 3: Independent Oversight

**Commitment**: Summit's operation is subject to independent review by parties without operational incentive to approve marginal decisions.

**Observable Manifestation**:
- Regular third-party audits
- Internal review boards with structural independence
- Published audit summaries (abstracted for security)

**What This Does NOT Commit**:
- Specific audit frequency (though minimums may be stated)
- Internal oversight triggers (internal)
- Remediation thresholds (internal)

**Why This Is Invariant**:
- Prevents "grading your own homework"
- Creates accountability structure
- Demonstrates commitment beyond self-certification

---

### Invariant 4: Scope Limitation

**Commitment**: Summit operates within defined scope boundaries and does not expand mission without explicit governance approval.

**Observable Manifestation**:
- Public scope documentation
- Refusal to act outside scope even when technically possible
- Transparent scope change process

**What This Does NOT Commit**:
- How scope violations are detected (internal)
- Edge case resolution mechanisms (internal)
- Specific boundary heuristics (internal)

**Why This Is Invariant**:
- Prevents function creep and mission drift
- Maintains trust through bounded operation
- Enables meaningful consent and oversight

---

### Invariant 5: Appeal and Review Rights

**Commitment**: Stakeholders affected by Summit decisions have structured mechanisms to request review and appeal.

**Observable Manifestation**:
- Documented appeal processes
- Response time commitments
- Independent review of appeals (not auto-rejection)

**What This Does NOT Commit**:
- Appeal success rates or thresholds (outcome-dependent)
- Internal routing logic (internal)
- Specific review criteria (internal)

**Why This Is Invariant**:
- Provides accountability check on automated systems
- Demonstrates respect for stakeholder rights
- Creates feedback loop for improving decision quality

---

### Invariant 6: Transparency of Governance Changes

**Commitment**: Changes to Summit's governance, scope, or core policies are communicated with rationale and notice—not introduced silently.

**Observable Manifestation**:
- Public changelog for governance documents
- Advance notice for significant changes
- Explanation of why changes are necessary

**What This Does NOT Commit**:
- Specific notice periods (context-dependent)
- Internal operational adjustments (non-governance)
- Tactical security adaptations (internal)

**Why This Is Invariant**:
- Prevents silent erosion of commitments
- Maintains trust through predictable evolution
- Distinguishes governance changes from routine operations

---

### Invariant 7: No Retroactive Punishment

**Commitment**: Summit does not retroactively apply new policies to past behavior that was compliant at the time.

**Observable Manifestation**:
- Clear effective dates for policy changes
- Grandfathering of prior-compliant activity
- Distinction between new violations and policy updates

**What This Does NOT Commit**:
- How to handle ongoing behavior (may require prospective compliance)
- Internal risk scoring of historical patterns (internal)
- Discovery of previously-unknown violations (not retroactive policy)

**Why This Is Invariant**:
- Prevents arbitrary enforcement
- Maintains legitimacy of rules
- Demonstrates fairness and good faith

---

## Invariant Governance

### How Invariants Are Modified

Invariants are **deliberately hard to change** to maintain credibility:

1. **Public Proposal**: Changes must be proposed with full rationale
2. **Notice Period**: Minimum 90 days for comment and review
3. **Independent Review**: External oversight must assess proposed change
4. **Threshold for Adoption**: Requires executive and board approval
5. **Audit Trail**: Full documentation of decision process

### When Invariants Can Be Suspended

Invariants are **not absolute**—suspension is possible but transparent:

- **Emergency Exception**: Defined threat requiring temporary deviation
- **Limited Duration**: Clear sunset for exception
- **Public Notification**: Exception and rationale disclosed
- **Post-Incident Review**: Independent assessment of whether exception was justified

### Verification Mechanisms

Invariants must be **verifiable**, not just stated:

- **Behavioral Audit**: Regular review of decision outputs against invariants
- **Third-Party Testing**: External parties can probe for invariant violations
- **Public Incident Reporting**: Alleged violations trigger investigation and response
- **Transparency Reports**: Periodic publication of invariant compliance metrics (abstracted)

## Strategic Value of Invariants

### For Regulators
- Reduces need for prescriptive regulation (self-constraint is credible)
- Provides stable foundation for regulatory dialogue
- Demonstrates seriousness beyond compliance checkbox

### For Partners
- Reduces integration risk (behavior is predictable)
- Enables long-term planning (commitments don't shift arbitrarily)
- Provides assurance without needing deep technical access

### For Adversaries
- Narrows attack surface (no boundary probing on invariants)
- Makes escalation tactics less effective (no exploiting inconsistency)
- Forces attacks into more detectable, technical vectors

### For Users
- Creates enforceable expectations
- Provides grounds for accountability
- Signals respect and constraint

## Anti-Patterns

### Invariant Inflation
- Claiming too many things are invariant
- Treating operational preferences as sacred commitments
- **Result**: Invariants lose credibility when inevitably violated

**Fix**: Reserve invariants for truly core, defensible commitments

### Marketing-Driven Invariants
- Declaring invariants to sound impressive
- Adding invariants in competitive response
- **Result**: Invariants become liabilities when inconvenient

**Fix**: Only commit to what you can maintain under pressure

### Secret Invariants
- Having internal red lines that aren't public
- Operating by unstated rules
- **Result**: Looks arbitrary when undisclosed rules are enforced

**Fix**: If it's truly invariant, make it public (within security boundaries)

## Communicating Invariants

### Tone and Framing
- **Clear, not grandiose**: "Summit refuses to act without evidence" not "We have an unwavering commitment to truth and justice"
- **Specific, not vague**: "Independent oversight reviews decisions quarterly" not "We believe in accountability"
- **Observable, not aspirational**: "Appeal decisions within 72 hours" not "We strive to be responsive"

### Formats
- **Public website**: Invariants charter as standalone page
- **Partnership materials**: Reference invariants in integration docs
- **Regulatory filings**: Include invariants in governance submissions
- **Incident responses**: Cite invariants when explaining decisions

## Success Metrics

Public invariants are effective when:

- ✅ External parties reference invariants in evaluating Summit
- ✅ Regulators ask fewer clarifying questions (invariants provide stable foundation)
- ✅ Partners plan long-term integration with confidence
- ✅ Adversaries stop probing invariant boundaries (recognized as non-negotiable)
- ✅ Internal teams treat invariants as constraints, not suggestions
