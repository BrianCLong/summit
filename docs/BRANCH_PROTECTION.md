# Branch Protection Recommendations
- Protect `main`/`trunk`:
  - Require pull request before merge
  - Require status checks to pass:
    - CI — Build & Test (polyglot)
    - Security — SBOM + Scan
    - Release Drafter (optional)
  - Require reviews by CODEOWNERS
  - Require conversation resolution
  - Require linear history (squash-merge only)
- Enable merge queue for `main`.
- Auto-delete branches on merge.
