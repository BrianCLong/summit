# Geo-Cyber Intelligence Fusion Module

The Geo-Cyber Intelligence Fusion Module links traditional cyber threat
indicators with real‑world geopolitical events. It expands on the initial
blueprint by providing a richer set of features, integration points, and
analysis capabilities.

## Data Ingestion & Normalization

- **Cyber Feeds**: STIX/TAXII, MISP, malware sandboxes, and network telemetry.
- **Geospatial Sources**: ACLED, Live UA Map, AIS/ADS‑B, satellite imagery.
- **Signal Intelligence**: SIGINT/ELINT intercepts, spectrum monitoring.
- Each record is normalized to include coordinates, timestamps, source
  reliability, and sector/asset metadata.

## Storage & Indexing

- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** for spatial queries and temporal indexing.
- **Neo4j** graph projections for relationship exploration and influence
  propagation.
- **Elasticsearch** for fast text and indicator lookups.

## Fusion & Correlation Layer

- Spatial joins compute proximity of cyber indicators to kinetic events.
- Temporal windows highlight simultaneous or cascading incidents.
- Relationship scoring incorporates shared infrastructure, attacker TTPs,
  and historical patterns.
- Reliability metadata from both sources is factored into a unified
  correlation score used to rank fused events.

## Analytics & Modeling

- **Risk Scoring** blends cyber severity, local conflict intensity, and
  infrastructure criticality.
- **Predictive Models** forecast likely targets using time‑series trends,
  graph embeddings, and reinforcement learning feedback.
- **Anomaly Detection** flags outliers in spatial, temporal, or behavioural
  dimensions.

## Visualization & Interaction

- Mapbox/Kepler.gl front‑end with real‑time overlays, heatmaps, and
  drift‑line animations.
- Analysts can filter by region, asset type, or actor and drill into event
  timelines or relationships.

### Asset Overlays & Risk Assessment

- Static assets (e.g., power plants, fiber hubs) are registered with
  coordinates and sector metadata.
- The fusion engine aggregates nearby geo and cyber activity to derive a
  simple risk score per asset.
- Overlay services expose these scores so front ends can highlight
  infrastructure under potential threat.

## APIs & Integrations

- REST and GraphQL endpoints surface fused insights.
- Webhooks send alerts when correlations exceed policy thresholds.
- SOAR connectors trigger playbooks for containment or field reporting.

## Security & Governance

- RBAC scoped by geography and data classification.
- Audit trails on all fusion operations with tamper‑evident logs.
- Supports privacy preserving queries through differential privacy and
  homomorphic encryption research hooks.

The fusion module aligns cyber operations with geopolitical context,
turning disparate sensor feeds into actionable intelligence for
strategic, operational, and tactical decision makers.

### Reference Implementation

An accompanying `GeoCyberFusionEngine` provides a lightweight,
in-memory example of these concepts. It scores correlations using event
reliability, indicator severity, spatial distance, and temporal
proximity and exposes helper methods to retrieve the highest ranked
links for rapid prototyping and unit testing.
