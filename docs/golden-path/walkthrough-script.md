# Walkthrough Recording Script

Use this script to capture a 10-minute walkthrough video demonstrating:

1. Installing the Railhead CLI.
2. Generating an HTTP API repo.
3. Running the paved-road workflow locally (`npm test`, `make sbom`, `make sign`).
4. Reviewing GitHub Actions artifacts (SBOM, Grype, provenance, cosign).
5. Showing OPA gate evaluation.

Narration cues and demo commands are included to keep the recording aligned with compliance evidence requirements.
