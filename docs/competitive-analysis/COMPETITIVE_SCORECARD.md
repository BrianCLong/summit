# Competitive Scorecard: Summit (IntelGraph)

This scorecard measures Summit's target state (post-Gap-Closure) against market leaders in Intel, Graph, and Product management.

| Feature Area           | Summit (Target)              | Maltego                    | Palantir                   | Notion / Dotwork            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Core Moat**          | Policy-guarded Agentic Graph | Link Analysis & Transforms | Industrialized Data Fusion | Flexible Operating Ontology |
| **Connector SDK**      | Signed Receipts + Lineage    | Manual Transforms          | High-Scale Ingest          | API-first / Manual          |
| **Workflow Debugging** | Replay + Policy Trace        | N/A (Manual)               | Advanced (Foundry)         | Basic (Timeline)            |
| **Governance UX**      | Visual Lineage + Export      | N/A                        | High (Complex)             | High (Intuitive)            |
| **Compliance Pack**    | Automated Evidence           | N/A                        | Modular                    | Integrated                  |
| **AI Safety**          | Policy-Bound Agents          | N/A                        | Emerging                   | Basic (Gated)               |
| **FinOps Cockpit**     | Per-tenant Attribution       | N/A                        | High-Scale                 | N/A                         |

## Key Competitive Differentiators

1. **Signed Receipts by Default:** Unlike competitors who track logs, Summit provides cryptographically signed receipts for every ingest and action event, ensuring non-repudiation.
2. **Policy-Bound Agents:** Agents in Summit cannot perform tool calls without a successful OPA preflight, whereas most AI copilots rely on post-hoc filtering or basic RLS.
3. **Graph-Native Governance:** Governance isn't a layer on top; it's expressed as constraints within the IntelGraph, allowing for real-time impact analysis of policy changes.
4. **Unit Economics Transparency:** Built-in FinOps at the orchestration level allows for precise COGS attribution in multi-tenant scenarios.
