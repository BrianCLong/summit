# Accessible UI Prototype: User Testing Plan

1. **Recruit participants** representing a mix of assistive technology users, keyboard-only users, and power users.
2. **Scenario walkthroughs**
   - Minimal Path: complete a search with no hints.
   - Assistive Copilot: follow the hint and complete the task.
   - Power User: use the `/` shortcut and keyboard navigation.
3. **Observation & logging**
   - Screen recording and event logs (`variant_change`, `search`, `select_item`).
   - Note where participants struggle or use assistive features.
4. **Post-task interviews** to gather qualitative feedback on clarity, efficiency, and accessibility.
5. **Iterate** on the interface based on findings, prioritizing WCAG 2.2 AA compliance and user preferences.
