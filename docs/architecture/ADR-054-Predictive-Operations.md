# ADR-054: Predictive Operations

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Reactive incident response, while necessary, is insufficient for maintaining high availability and performance in complex distributed systems. Proactive identification and mitigation of potential issues are crucial.

## Decision

We will implement a Predictive Operations framework that leverages historical monitoring data and machine learning to forecast anomalies and trigger proactive alerts.

1.  **Data Integration:** Integrate with existing monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana) to collect and centralize historical metrics data.
2.  **Forecasting Models:** Develop and deploy machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to forecast trends and identify deviations from expected behavior for key operational metrics (latency, error rates, resource utilization).
3.  **Proactive Alerting:** Configure alerting rules based on forecasted anomalies, triggering alerts before SLOs are breached or incidents occur.
4.  **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop to continuously retrain and improve forecasting models based on actual incident data and alert effectiveness.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Reduced MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution), improved system stability, fewer customer-impacting incidents, more efficient resource utilization.
- **Cons:** Requires significant data engineering and MLOps effort, potential for false positives (alert fatigue) if models are not well-tuned, reliance on data quality.
