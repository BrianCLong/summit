# Summit Investor Moat Narrative: The Governed Intelligence Fabric

## The Problem

Generative AI is being adopted unevenly because enterprises cannot reliably answer:

- What data did the model touch?
- Was the use authorized under licensing and jurisdiction constraints?
- Which tools were invoked, and what did they do?
- Can we reproduce or at least fully explain how this output happened?
- Can we prove this to auditors, regulators, partners, and courts?

Most AI products offer controls; few offer proof.

## The Category Shift

The next platform layer is not “better generation.” It is “governed intelligence”:

- AI outputs become evidence-bearing artifacts
- Agent actions become policy-constrained operations
- Execution becomes provable via immutable provenance graphs and signed attestations

Summit is built at this layer.

## What Summit Is

Summit is an Intelligence Foundry Operating System:

- A tenant-isolated, policy-defined environment
- Producing outputs through agents and tools
- With deterministic provenance capture and evidence bundle sealing
- Verifiable offline, independent of Summit’s runtime

In effect, Summit turns AI into a controlled actor with an audit trail.

## Why This Is a Moat (Not a Feature)

1. Proof-grade provenance is architecture, not UI
   - Requires content-addressed graphs, deterministic serialization, and signed attestations.
   - Retrofitting this onto a typical AI product is expensive and incomplete.

1. Policy-constrained tool mediation is the control point
   - Every tool call passes through an authorization and parameter constraint layer.
   - This prevents exfiltration and enables approvals/quorum workflows.

1. Multi-foundry generalization
   - Creative generation is one Foundry type.
   - Summit supports any domain where outputs must be trusted: defense, finance, legal, infrastructure, compliance.

1. Evidence portability locks in trust, not usage
   - Evidence bundles are verifiable independent of Summit.
   - This converts platform trust into an enterprise governance primitive.

## Competitive Framing

Creative foundries validate market demand for IP safety in content creation.
Summit generalizes the same trust problem to all enterprise intelligence, with higher stakes and higher switching costs.

## Why Now

- Agents are moving from “chat” to “acting systems.”
- Acting systems require governance, provenance, and approvals to be deployable at scale.
- Enterprises will standardize on a trust substrate; the winner becomes infrastructure.

Summit is built to be that substrate.

## Expansion Vector

Start with one Foundry (e.g., Creative or Compliance).
Expand to multiple Foundries with shared governance contracts.
Each added domain increases defensibility because the evidence substrate becomes the enterprise standard for “trustable AI.”
