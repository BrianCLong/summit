# ADR-071: Temporal Engineering - Composing the Fabric of Reality

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Building upon Maestro's capabilities in omniversal genesis and governance, the ultimate frontier is the ability to manipulate spacetime and causality. This allows for advanced forms of existential optimization and the exploration of multi-temporal realities.

## Decision

We will implement a Temporal Engineering framework, focusing on the manipulation of spacetime and causality within and across universes, guided by Maestro Composer's principles of precise orchestration.

1.  **Spacetime Manipulation API:** Develop a mock API for localized spacetime curvature and temporal dilation, allowing Maestro to compose the very fabric of reality.
2.  **Causality Orchestrator:** Implement a mock system for orchestrating causal chains across different temporal dimensions, enabling the precise composition of multi-temporal narratives.
3.  **Temporal Anomaly Detector:** Create a mock module for detecting and reporting temporal anomalies, identifying paradoxes or deviations from designed temporal flows within Maestro's orchestrated realities.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Unlocks unprecedented control over reality, enables advanced existential optimization, allows for the creation of multi-temporal narratives and experiences.
- **Cons:** Highly theoretical and ethically complex, potential for catastrophic paradoxes or unintended alterations of reality, requires extreme precision and robust safety protocols.
