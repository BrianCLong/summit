# ADR-071: Temporal Engineering

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Building upon Maestro's capabilities in omniversal genesis and governance, the ultimate frontier is the ability to manipulate spacetime and causality. This allows for advanced forms of existential optimization and the exploration of multi-temporal realities.

## Decision

We will implement a Temporal Engineering framework, focusing on the manipulation of spacetime and causality within and across universes.

1.  **Spacetime Manipulation API:** Develop a mock API for localized spacetime curvature and temporal dilation. This API will allow for controlled experimentation with the fabric of reality.
2.  **Causality Orchestrator:** Implement a mock system for orchestrating causal chains across different temporal dimensions. This will enable the design and execution of complex multi-temporal events.
3.  **Temporal Anomaly Detector:** Create a mock module for detecting and reporting temporal anomalies. This includes identifying paradoxes, unexpected causal shifts, or deviations from designed temporal flows.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Unlocks unprecedented control over reality, enables advanced existential optimization, allows for the creation of multi-temporal narratives and experiences.
- **Cons:** Highly theoretical and ethically complex, potential for catastrophic paradoxes or unintended alterations of reality, requires extreme precision and robust safety protocols.
