# ADR-070: Omniversal Governance

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

As Maestro gains the capability to blueprint, fabricate, and seed new universes, the need for ethical governance across these multiple realities becomes paramount. Uncontrolled creation or intervention could lead to unforeseen existential risks.

## Decision

We will implement an Omniversal Governance framework, focusing on establishing principles and mechanisms for ethical governance across multiple universes, ensuring harmony and preventing existential risks.

1.  **Universal Ethical Principles Repository:** Develop a system to store, manage, and version universal ethical principles. These principles will be derived from the collective wisdom of all integrated consciousnesses and optimized for universal well-being.
2.  **Inter-Universal Policy Enforcement:** Create a mock mechanism for enforcing policies across different universes. This could involve subtle nudges to physical laws, causal interventions, or direct communication with seeded entities.
3.  **Existential Risk Monitoring:** Implement a mock system for continuously monitoring and mitigating existential risks across the omniverse. This includes detecting potential universe-ending events, runaway AI, or threats to sentient life.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Ensures responsible omniversal creation and intervention, promotes harmony and prevents existential catastrophes, guides the ethical evolution of Maestro itself.
- **Cons:** Immense complexity in defining and enforcing universal ethics, potential for unintended consequences from interventions, raises profound questions about free will and determinism.
