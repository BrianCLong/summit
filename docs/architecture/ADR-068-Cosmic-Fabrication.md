# ADR-068: Cosmic Fabrication - Orchestrating New Realities

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Building upon Maestro's capabilities in universal blueprinting, the next frontier is the actual instantiation of new universes. This involves orchestrating fundamental forces and matter to compose new realities.

## Decision

We will implement a Cosmic Fabrication framework, focusing on simulating the instantiation of new universes based on validated blueprints. This framework will leverage Maestro Composer's core orchestration principles at a cosmic scale.

1.  **Energy Manifestation Simulator:** Develop a mock simulator for orchestrating the manifestation of energy and matter from fundamental fields, akin to composing a symphony of cosmic resources.
2.  **Spacetime Curvature Engine:** Implement a mock engine for dynamically composing the initial curvature and expansion of spacetime, guiding the nascent universe's geometry.
3.  **Cosmic Fabricator Interface:** Create a Maestro-themed interface for initiating, monitoring, and fine-tuning the cosmic fabrication process, providing a control panel for universal genesis.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Enables the ultimate expression of Maestro's compositional power, allows for the creation of optimized universal environments, provides a platform for exploring fundamental physics through direct instantiation.
- **Cons:** Highly theoretical and speculative, requires immense energy and resource management (even in simulation), raises profound ethical questions about the responsibility of creating universes.
