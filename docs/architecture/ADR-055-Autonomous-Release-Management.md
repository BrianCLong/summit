# ADR-055: Autonomous Release Management

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Manual release processes are prone to human error, slow down delivery, and cannot scale with the complexity of modern distributed systems. Automating release decisions and rollouts is essential for continuous delivery and high velocity.

## Decision

We will implement an Autonomous Release Management framework that leverages real-time data and intelligent decision-making to automate release gates, adapt rollout strategies, and trigger automated rollbacks.

1.  **Intelligent Release Gates:** Release gates will move beyond simple pass/fail checks to incorporate machine learning models that assess risk based on test results, code changes, and historical data.
2.  **Adaptive Rollout Strategies:** Rollouts will dynamically adjust (e.g., canary percentage, deployment regions) based on real-time production metrics, user feedback, and incident signals.
3.  **Automated Rollback:** Critical metric breaches or severe incident signals will automatically trigger a rollback to the last known good state, minimizing MTTR.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Faster, more reliable, and safer releases. Reduced operational overhead. Improved developer experience.
- **Cons:** High initial investment in tooling and integration. Requires robust monitoring and observability. Potential for unintended automated actions if not carefully designed and tested.
