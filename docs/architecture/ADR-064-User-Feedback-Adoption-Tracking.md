# ADR-064: User Feedback & Adoption Tracking

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Understanding how users interact with Maestro, identifying their needs, and tracking the adoption of new features are crucial for product development and continuous improvement. Relying solely on anecdotal feedback or basic analytics is insufficient for data-driven decisions.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive User Feedback & Adoption Tracking framework, focusing on collecting structured feedback, analyzing user engagement, and visualizing adoption funnels.

1.  **Structured Feedback Collection:** Enhance existing feedback mechanisms (e.g., in-app forms, support tickets) to collect structured data, including feature requests, bug reports, and general sentiment, with predefined categories and metadata.
2.  **User Engagement Metrics:** Integrate with analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel, custom telemetry) to track granular user engagement metrics, such as feature usage, session duration, and key workflow completion rates.
3.  **Adoption Funnel Analysis:** Develop dashboards and reports to visualize user adoption funnels for critical features. This will help identify drop-off points and areas for onboarding improvement.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Data-driven product decisions, improved user satisfaction, faster feature iteration, clearer understanding of product value and impact.
- **Cons:** Requires careful planning for data privacy and compliance, potential for data overload if not properly managed, need for dedicated analytics and product management resources.
