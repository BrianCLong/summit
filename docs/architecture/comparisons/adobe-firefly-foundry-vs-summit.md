# Adobe Firefly Foundry vs Summit (Executive Comparison)

This comparison is directional and focuses on strategic posture and system boundaries.

## Summary

Adobe Firefly Foundry: enterprise creative generation with IP-safe positioning, embedded in creative workflows.

Summit: governed intelligence production across domains (creative, analytic, compliance, operational) with evidence-grade provenance, policy enforcement, and auditable attestations.

## Comparison Table

| Dimension | Adobe Firefly Foundry | Summit Intelligence Foundry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary scope | Creative generation (media/marketing workflows) | Cross-domain intelligence production (decisions, actions, artifacts) |
| Core trust claim | IP-safe training and usage posture | Proof-grade provenance and policy-constrained execution |
| Tenancy model | Enterprise-focused, private model options | Tenant-isolated by default, cross-tenant only via explicit grants |
| Governance | Product controls and enterprise assurances | Formal PBAC/PBAC+, policy gateway, deny-by-default tools |
| Provenance | Workflow metadata and content management | Deterministic execution DAG + signed attestations + offline verification |
| Reproducibility | Best-effort; dependent on model services | Policy-selectable strict vs best-effort with explicit evidence |
| Tooling | Creative toolchain integrations | Tool mediation for any external capability (web/db/deploy/export) |
| Outputs | Media assets | Media + decisions + actions + compliance evidence bundles |
| Regulated readiness | Media-forward, risk-mitigated | Designed for audit/compliance requirements and admissibility |
| Moat | Adobe ecosystem + creative workflow dominance | Evidence + governance substrate + graph-native lineage across domains |

## Why Summit is structurally broader

Summit positions the “foundry” as a general governance substrate:

- Any model, any agent, any tool, any domain
- Uniform evidence contracts across all outputs
- Policy and provenance treated as first-class artifacts

This enables Summit to subsume creative foundries as a single specialization rather than the top-level platform.
