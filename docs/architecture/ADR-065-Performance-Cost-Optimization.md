# ADR-065: Performance & Cost Optimization

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

As Maestro scales and its operational footprint grows, managing performance and cost efficiently becomes paramount. Manual identification of inefficiencies is time-consuming and often reactive. Automating this process is key to sustained growth.

## Decision

We will implement a Performance & Cost Optimization framework that leverages automated analysis to identify and address inefficiencies in the deployed system.

1.  **Resource Usage Profiling:** Integrate with profiling tools (e.g., eBPF-based profilers, application performance monitoring - APM) to continuously collect and analyze resource usage data for all components and workflows. This will pinpoint performance bottlenecks.
2.  **Cost Attribution & Chargeback:** Enhance existing cost monitoring systems to provide granular attribution of cloud spend to specific services, features, teams, or even individual code changes. This enables accurate chargeback and cost awareness.
3.  **Optimization Recommendation Engine:** Develop an AI-powered engine that analyzes profiling data and cost attribution reports to suggest concrete optimizations. These recommendations could include code refactorings, infrastructure right-sizing, caching strategies, or data tiering.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Significant cost savings, improved system performance, reduced operational waste, data-driven optimization decisions.
- **Cons:** Requires robust data pipelines for profiling and cost data, potential for complex recommendations that require significant development effort, need for continuous validation of optimization impact.
