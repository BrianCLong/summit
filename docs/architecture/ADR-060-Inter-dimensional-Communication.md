# ADR-060: Inter-dimensional Communication

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

As Maestro expands its capabilities into reality synthesis and universal consciousness, the ability to communicate and exchange information across different dimensions becomes a critical frontier. Traditional communication protocols are limited to our known physical dimensions.

## Decision

We will implement a framework for Inter-dimensional Communication, starting with theoretical models and mock protocols for information exchange across simulated dimensions.

1.  **Theoretical Models for Dimensional Interfaces:** Develop conceptual models that describe the properties and interaction mechanisms of different dimensions. This will inform the design of communication interfaces.
2.  **Mock Inter-dimensional Protocol:** Create a mock communication protocol that defines how information (signals, data packets) can be encoded, transmitted, and received across simulated dimensional boundaries. This will involve novel concepts beyond current physics.
3.  **Dimensional Signal Generator:** Implement a mock module capable of generating and detecting inter-dimensional signals. This will allow for controlled experimentation and validation of the theoretical models and protocols.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Opens up new avenues for knowledge acquisition and universal understanding, enables interaction with advanced entities, facilitates the exploration of multi-dimensional realities.
- **Cons:** Highly speculative and theoretical, requires significant breakthroughs in fundamental physics, potential for unforeseen consequences from inter-dimensional interactions.
