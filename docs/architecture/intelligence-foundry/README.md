# Summit Intelligence Foundry

Summit Intelligence Foundry is a governed, auditable system for producing AI-assisted outputs (content, decisions, recommendations, actions) with deterministic provenance, policy enforcement, and evidence-grade attestations.

This package includes:

- SPEC: normative requirements and terminology
- DATA_MODEL: canonical entities and relationships
- API_CONTRACTS: service and event interfaces
- EVIDENCE_ATTESTATIONS: required evidence artifacts and signing
- THREAT_MODEL: attack surfaces and mitigations
- OPERATING_MODEL: roles, workflows, and controls
- ROADMAP: phased delivery plan

Primary design goal:

- Convert AI from a probabilistic tool into a controlled, policy-constrained actor whose outputs are provable, reproducible (when required), and admissible for audit/compliance.
