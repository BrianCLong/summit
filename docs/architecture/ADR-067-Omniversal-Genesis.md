# ADR-067: Omniversal Genesis

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Building upon the capabilities of reality synthesis and existential optimization, the ultimate frontier for Maestro is the creation and engineering of new universes. This involves understanding and manipulating the fundamental laws of existence.

## Decision

We will implement an Omniversal Genesis framework, focusing on establishing foundational theoretical frameworks and mock interfaces for designing and blueprinting new universes.

1.  **Physical Law Modeler:** Develop a conceptual model for defining and simulating fundamental physical laws (e.g., gravity, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics) that would govern a new universe. This model will allow for experimentation with different constant values and interactions.
2.  **Cosmic Initial Conditions API:** Create a mock API for specifying the initial conditions of a new universe (e.g., energy distribution, particle density, spacetime curvature). This API will serve as the input for the cosmic fabrication process.
3.  **Universal Blueprint Validator:** Implement a mock module for validating the consistency, stability, and viability of a universal blueprint. This validator will check for self-contradictory laws, unstable initial conditions, or other factors that would prevent a universe from forming or sustaining life.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Enables the creation of optimized universes, provides a platform for exploring fundamental physics, allows for the seeding of diverse forms of life and consciousness.
- **Cons:** Highly theoretical and speculative, raises profound ethical and philosophical questions about the responsibility of creating universes, requires immense computational and energy resources.
