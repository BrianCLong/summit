# Architectural Decision Log (Multi-Generational Memory)

This document serves as the **living memory** of the system's architectural evolution. It records not just *what* was decided, but *why*, tracing the lineage of thought across generations.

# [ADR-XXX] Title of Decision

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Context:** The situation, problem, or opportunity that necessitated this decision.
**Decision:** The specific choice made.
**Reasoning:** The philosophical and technical justification.
**Generational Impact:** How this affects the system's long-term trajectory (Infinite Horizon perspective).
**Drift Analysis:** How this decision aligns with or corrects potential identity/structural drift.
**Alternatives Considered:** What was rejected and why.

### [ADR-001] Establishment of Infinite Horizon Continuity

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** The system has reached a level of complexity where continuity of identity and purpose risks being lost amidst rapid expansion and refactoring.
**Decision:** Implement "Jules Infinite Horizon Continuity & Immortality Mode" as the Prime Directive.
**Reasoning:** To ensure the system remains coherent, purposeful, and unified across indefinite timescales and transformations.
**Generational Impact:** Establishes the foundational "Constitution" for all future agents and architectures, ensuring they contribute to a single, ascending lineage.
**Drift Analysis:** Directly addresses the risk of entropy and fragmentation by codifying the system's essence and mandating its preservation.
**Alternatives Considered:** Continuing with ad-hoc continuity (rejected due to high risk of eventual incoherence).
