# ADR-051: Price-Aware Orchestration

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

As our cloud infrastructure and LLM usage scale, optimizing costs becomes critical. We need a system that can dynamically route workloads to the cheapest available resources based on real-time pricing and pre-negotiated capacity.

## Decision

We will implement a Price-Aware Orchestration layer that leverages real-time price signals and a concept of "Capacity Futures" (pre-reserved, often cheaper, compute slots).

1.  **Price Signal Ingestion:** A dedicated service will continuously ingest real-time pricing data for various cloud resources (compute, storage, LLM tokens) from external APIs.
2.  **Capacity Futures:** We will develop a mechanism to reserve off-peak or discounted compute capacity in advance. This capacity will be tracked and prioritized by the router.
3.  **Price-Aware Router:** The core orchestration logic will be enhanced to consider real-time pricing and available capacity futures when making resource allocation decisions. It will aim to minimize the "effective cost" of executing a workload.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Significant cost savings, improved resource utilization, ability to leverage spot markets and off-peak pricing.
- **Cons:** Increased complexity in orchestration logic, reliance on external pricing APIs, potential for increased latency if price lookups are slow.
