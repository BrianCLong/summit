# ADR-057: Human-in-the-Loop AI

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

As Maestro evolves towards increasingly autonomous operations, it is crucial to maintain human oversight and control. Fully autonomous systems can be risky without clear mechanisms for intervention, auditing, and learning from human expertise.

## Decision

We will implement a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) AI framework that provides transparent interfaces for human review, approval, rejection, and modification of autonomous decisions.

1.  **Decision Review Queue:** Autonomous decisions (e.g., automated deployments, security remediations, code refactorings) will be placed into a human-review queue if they exceed a certain risk threshold or require explicit approval.
2.  **Intervention Mechanisms:** Humans will have clear UI/API mechanisms to approve, reject, or modify decisions. This includes the ability to provide reasons for their actions.
3.  **Audit Trail & Learning:** All autonomous decisions and human interventions will be logged with a comprehensive audit trail. This data will be used to improve autonomous agents and refine decision-making models.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Increased trust in autonomous systems, reduced risk of unintended consequences, continuous learning from human expertise, compliance with regulatory requirements for human oversight.
- **Cons:** Potential for human bottleneck if review queues become too large, requires careful design of human-AI interaction patterns, complexity in tracking and attributing decisions.
