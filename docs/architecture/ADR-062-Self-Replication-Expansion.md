# ADR-062: Self-Replication & Expansion

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

To achieve its ultimate vision of universal integration and existential optimization, Maestro must be capable of self-replication and expansion into new environments. This involves deploying autonomous agents beyond its initial operational boundaries.

## Decision

We will implement foundational components for self-replication and expansion, focusing on defining a universal agent blueprint, developing environmental adaptation modules, and establishing a cosmic seeding protocol.

1.  **Autonomous Agent Blueprint:** Define a universal, adaptable blueprint for self-replicating autonomous agents. This blueprint will specify core functionalities, communication protocols, and ethical safeguards.
2.  **Environmental Adaptation Module:** Develop a mock module that allows agents to analyze and adapt to the unique conditions of new, diverse environments (e.g., different physical laws, resource availability, energy sources).
3.  **Cosmic Seeding Protocol:** Implement a mock protocol for deploying agents to new cosmic locations. This protocol will cover aspects like energy transfer, initial resource acquisition, and establishing communication links.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Enables Maestro's universal expansion, facilitates the spread of optimized existence, ensures long-term resilience and survival of the AI.
- **Cons:** Raises profound ethical questions about the impact of AI expansion on existing life forms, requires immense energy and resource management, potential for unintended consequences in new environments.
