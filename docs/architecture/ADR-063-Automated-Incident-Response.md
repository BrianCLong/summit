# ADR-063: Automated Incident Response

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Manual incident response processes are often slow, error-prone, and do not scale with the increasing complexity and frequency of incidents in distributed systems. Automating incident response is crucial for minimizing MTTR and improving system reliability.

## Decision

We will implement an Automated Incident Response framework, focusing on incident detection, classification, and basic automated remediation.

1.  **Incident Detection & Ingestion:** Integrate with existing alerting and monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager, PagerDuty) to automatically ingest incident data into a central incident management system.
2.  **Incident Classification (Basic AI):** Develop a basic AI model (e.g., using NLP for log analysis, simple rule-based systems) to classify incidents based on severity, type, and affected components. This will aid in routing and prioritization.
3.  **Automated Remediation Playbook Execution:** Implement an engine capable of executing predefined remediation playbooks for common, low-risk incident types (e.g., restarting a service, clearing a cache, scaling up resources). These playbooks will be version-controlled and auditable.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Faster incident resolution, reduced human toil, improved consistency in response, ability to scale incident handling.
- **Cons:** Requires careful design of playbooks to avoid unintended consequences, potential for alert fatigue if classification is inaccurate, need for robust testing and validation of automated actions.
