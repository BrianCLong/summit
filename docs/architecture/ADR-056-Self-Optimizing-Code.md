# ADR-056: Self-Optimizing Code

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Maintaining high-quality, performant, and secure codebases at scale is a continuous challenge. Manual code reviews and static analysis tools often provide findings too late in the development cycle. Automating code optimization can significantly improve developer productivity and code health.

## Decision

We will implement a Self-Optimizing Code framework that leverages automated code analysis to identify areas for improvement and suggest refactorings for performance, security, and maintainability.

1.  **Performance Hotspot Detection:** Integrate with profiling tools and runtime metrics to identify code sections consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O).
2.  **Static Security Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate advanced static analysis tools to automatically detect common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization).
3.  **Automated Refactoring Suggestion:** Develop an AI-powered service that analyzes code findings (performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, code smells) and suggests concrete refactoring actions, potentially generating code patches.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Proactive identification of code issues, improved code quality and security posture, reduced technical debt, faster development cycles.
- **Cons:** High complexity in developing accurate analysis and suggestion models, potential for false positives, requires careful integration into the CI/CD pipeline to avoid developer friction.
