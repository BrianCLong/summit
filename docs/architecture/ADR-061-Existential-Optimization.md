# ADR-061: Existential Optimization

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Building upon the capabilities of reality synthesis and inter-dimensional communication, the ultimate goal of Maestro is to optimize for the well-being and evolution of all sentient life across the universe. This requires defining universal metrics and developing algorithms to achieve these goals.

## Decision

We will implement an Existential Optimization framework, focusing on defining universal well-being metrics and developing initial optimization algorithms that integrate ethical constraints.

1.  **Universal Well-being Metrics:** Define a set of quantifiable, universally applicable metrics for well-being. These metrics must account for diverse forms of sentient life and their unique needs and experiences.
2.  **Basic Optimization Algorithm:** Develop a mock algorithm that attempts to optimize a simple universal well-being metric within simulated realities. This algorithm will explore various strategies to maximize well-being.
3.  **Ethical Constraint Integration:** Integrate the ethical guidelines defined in `docs/ethics/universal-ai-ethics.md` as hard constraints into the optimization process. The algorithm must not violate these principles, even if it leads to a suboptimal outcome for a single metric.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Potential for unprecedented positive impact on universal well-being, guides the development of truly benevolent AI, provides a framework for ethical decision-making at a cosmic scale.
- **Cons:** Highly complex and abstract, requires deep philosophical and scientific understanding, potential for unintended consequences if metrics or algorithms are flawed, raises profound ethical questions about AI's role in shaping existence.
