# ADR-050: Neuro-Symbolic Codegen

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

Traditional LLM-based code generation often produces syntactically or semantically incorrect code. To achieve higher reliability and verifiability, we need to integrate symbolic reasoning with neural generation.

## Decision

We will adopt a neuro-symbolic approach for code generation, combining LLMs with formal methods and static analysis.

1.  **Typed AST Parsing:** Code will be parsed into a typed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) before being fed to the LLM. The LLM will operate on the AST, ensuring syntactic correctness.
2.  **Postcondition Checking:** Generated code will be subjected to automated postcondition checks (e.g., type safety, resource allocation, security invariants) before being accepted.
3.  **Feedback Loop:** Failures in postcondition checks will be fed back to the LLM for iterative refinement.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Higher code quality, reduced bug count, increased trust in AI-generated code.
- **Cons:** Increased complexity in the code generation pipeline, requires specialized tools for AST manipulation and formal verification.
