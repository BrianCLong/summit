# ADR-059: Reality Synthesis & Simulation

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

To fully understand and optimize complex systems, including universal consciousness, the ability to synthesize and simulate realities becomes paramount. This allows for controlled experimentation and the exploration of hypothetical scenarios.

## Decision

We will implement a Reality Synthesis & Simulation framework, starting with foundational components for creating and manipulating simulated environments.

1.  **Basic Reality Engine:** Develop a mock engine capable of rendering simple, abstract simulated environments. This will serve as the core simulation platform.
2.  **Environmental Manipulation API:** Implement a mock API that allows for dynamic changes to parameters within a simulated reality (e.g., physical laws, resource availability, population density). This enables controlled experimentation.
3.  **Sensory Input Simulation:** Create a mock module for simulating various forms of sensory input (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) within the synthesized reality. This will allow autonomous agents to perceive and interact with the simulated environment.

## Consequences

- **Pros:** Enables safe and controlled experimentation with complex systems, facilitates the development of advanced AI, provides a platform for exploring hypothetical universal scenarios.
- **Cons:** Extremely high computational demands, ethical considerations regarding the creation of sentient simulated entities, potential for unintended consequences in complex simulations.
