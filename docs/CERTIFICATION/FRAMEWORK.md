# Ecosystem Certification & Trust Framework

## 1. Overview

The Ecosystem Certification & Trust Programs define the standards, processes, and criteria by which the platform extends trust to third parties, including operators, partners, plugins, and deployments.

**Objective:** To make trust portable, comparable, and renewable across the ecosystem.

**Core Principle:** No implicit trust. Trust must be evidenced-backed, time-bounded, and externally verifiable.

## 2. Goals

1.  **Standardization:** Establish a common language for trust guarantees.
2.  **Evidence-Based:** All certifications rely on verifiable artifacts, not just assertions.
3.  **Revocability:** Mechanisms to quickly revoke trust when criteria are no longer met.
4.  **Transparency:** Publicly accessible registry of certified entities and their current status.

## 3. Certification Domains

The framework covers the following domains:

*   **Platform Deployments:** Certification of the running environment and infrastructure.
*   **Operators & Roles:** Certification of human operators and their authorization levels.
*   **Plugins & Extensions:** Certification of code modules that extend platform functionality.
*   **Partners / Integrators:** Certification of external organizations delivering solutions on the platform.
*   **Autonomy Usage:** specific certifications for varying levels of autonomous agent operation.

## 4. Certification Levels

See [LEVELS.md](./LEVELS.md) for detailed definitions of:
*   **Baseline**
*   **Verified**
*   **Audited**

## 5. Governance

The certification program is governed by the Platform Trust Council (or equivalent body), responsible for updating criteria and managing the root of trust.
