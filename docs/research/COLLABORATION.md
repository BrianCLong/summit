# External Research Collaboration

## 1. Principle: Structured, Secure, and Mutually Beneficial Engagement

External collaboration can be a valuable source of new ideas and perspectives for the Research Track. However, it must be managed in a structured and secure manner that protects the organization's interests and intellectual property while fostering a productive relationship with our partners. All collaborations must be formally defined, time-bound, and aligned with an approved research domain.

## 2. Rules for Collaboration

### 2.1. Partner Approval

- All external research partners (e.g., academic institutions, think tanks, individual researchers) must be vetted and formally approved before any collaboration can begin.
- The approval process includes a review by Legal to ensure that all necessary agreements are in place.

### 2.2. Formal Agreements

- No collaboration may proceed without a formal, written agreement that has been executed by all parties.
- This agreement must, at a minimum, clearly define:
  - The scope and objectives of the research.
  - The timeline and expected deliverables.
  - The roles and responsibilities of each party.
  - **Intellectual Property (IP) Rights:** A clear stipulation of how any IP generated during the collaboration will be owned and licensed.
  - **Disclosure and Publication Boundaries:** Rules governing how and when the results of the research can be published or otherwise disclosed.

### 2.3. Environment and Data Access

- External collaborators will **never** be granted access to the organization's internal or production environments.
- Any collaboration that requires a shared technical environment must be conducted in a dedicated, "air-gapped" sandbox that is purpose-built for the project and completely isolated from all other systems.
- The sharing of any data with external partners is subject to the same strict rules outlined in `ETHICS_AND_SAFETY.md`, requiring, at a minimum, full anonymization and approval from the Data Governance and Ethics Committee.

## 3. Scope of Collaboration

- Collaboration is restricted to the domains listed in `APPROVED_DOMAINS.md`.
- The primary purpose of external collaboration is to explore early-stage, pre-competitive ideas. It is not a vehicle for outsourcing product development.

By adhering to these rules, the Research Track can engage with the broader research community in a way that is both innovative and secure, ensuring that these partnerships create value without introducing unacceptable risk.
