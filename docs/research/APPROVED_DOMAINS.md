# Approved Research Domains

## 1. Mandate and Scope

This document provides an explicit, exhaustive list of the domains in which the Research Track is authorized to conduct exploratory work. Research outside of these domains is not permitted without a formal amendment to this document, which requires board-level approval.

The primary purpose of this list is to focus research efforts on areas of long-term strategic importance while preventing resource expenditure on initiatives that are out of scope or misaligned with organizational goals. All research conducted within these domains must still adhere to the policies defined in `BOUNDARIES.md` and `ETHICS_AND_SAFETY.md`.

## 2. Approved Domains List

Research is permitted exclusively within the following domains:

### 2.1. Long-Horizon Autonomy Theory

- **Description:** Theoretical exploration of advanced autonomous systems, their capabilities, and their limitations.
- **Constraints:** This research is strictly theoretical. No code intended for execution or operational agents may be produced. The output shall be in the form of mathematical models, whitepapers, and formal proofs.

### 2.2. Novel Coordination Models

- **Description:** Investigation into new methods for coordinating multiple autonomous agents or complex systems.
- **Constraints:** All explorations must be conducted in isolated, simulated environments. No live or production data may be used. The focus is on algorithms and protocols, not on building operational systems.

### 2.3. Governance Formalization

- **Description:** Research into the use of formal logic, mathematical proofs, and other rigorous methods to define and verify governance policies.
- **Constraints:** This is not software development. The output should be formal specifications or proofs (e.g., in TLA+, Coq, or similar formal methods), not policy-as-code to be deployed.

### 2.4. Strategic Foresight (Beyond 36 Months)

- **Description:** Analysis of long-term trends, emerging technologies, and potential future scenarios that could impact the organization's strategic landscape beyond the current three-year planning horizon.
- **Constraints:** This research is analytical and advisory. It will produce reports, scenarios, and strategic briefs, not technical artifacts.

### 2.5. Academic Collaboration Prototypes

- **Description:** The development of non-deployable prototypes in collaboration with approved academic partners to explore cutting-edge concepts.
- **Constraints:** All prototypes must be developed in a dedicated, "air-gapped" research environment and are explicitly forbidden from being integrated with any production or pre-production system. These prototypes are for demonstration and learning purposes only.
