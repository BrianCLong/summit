## 2. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

### SIG-2026-001 (n8n RCE)
*   **T1190**: Exploit Public-Facing Application
*   **T1059**: Command and Scripting Interpreter
*   **T1552**: Unsecured Credentials (access to GitHub PATs/API keys)
*   **Gap**: Existing CI gates checks for `npm` vulnerabilities but may miss self-hosted docker image versions.

### SIG-2026-002 & 003 (Narrative & Economic Warfare)
*   **T1617** (PRE): Acquire Capabilities (DaaS)
*   **T1584** (Resource Dev): Compromise Infrastructure
*   **Gap**: Current Narrative Engine lacks "Economic" domain context and BEND framing classifiers.

### SIG-2026-004 (AI DaaS Amplification)
*   **T1583**: Acquire Infrastructure (Botnets)
*   **Gap**: Need behavioral detection for "High Velocity / Low Variance" content (Synthetic Amplification).
