# Research Review Cadence and Process

## 1. Principle: Learning Over Progress

The primary goal of the research review process is to facilitate organizational learning, not to function as a traditional project status meeting. The focus is on what was discovered, what was proven or disproven, and what new questions have emerged. The review is a forum for intellectual exchange, not a gate for decision-making.

## 2. The Quarterly Research Review

### 2.1. Cadence and Schedule

- A formal Research Review will be held once per fiscal quarter.
- The schedule for these reviews will be set at the beginning of each year.
- Attendance is mandatory for all members of the research team and their direct leadership.
- Attendance is open and encouraged for all other employees who wish to observe.

### 2.2. Standard Agenda

Each quarterly review will follow a standard agenda:

1.  **Review of Past Learnings:** A brief recap of the key findings from the previous quarter's review and any follow-up actions that were taken.
2.  **Presentation of Completed Research:** Research teams will present the artifacts (as defined in `ARTIFACT_STANDARDS.md`) for any lines of inquiry that were concluded during the quarter. The presentation will focus on:
    - What was learned?
    - What failed, and what can be learned from the failure?
    - What new questions were uncovered?
3.  **Discussion of Ongoing Research:** A high-level overview of research that is currently in progress. This is not a detailed status report, but an opportunity to share early insights or roadblocks.
4.  **Open Forum:** An open Q&A session for attendees to engage with the research team.

## 3. The Explicit Non-Action Default

**The default outcome of a research review is that no action will be taken.**

- The review is not a venue for making roadmap commitments, allocating resources, or approving projects.
- The presentation of a research artifact does not imply any change to the company's plans or priorities.
- The purpose of the review is to disseminate knowledge. Any subsequent action, such as the initiation of a formal Graduation Proposal as described in `GRADUATION_RULES.md`, must happen outside of the review and through its own separate, rigorous process.

This principle ensures that the research review remains a safe space for open and honest intellectual exploration, free from the pressure of immediate business deliverables.
