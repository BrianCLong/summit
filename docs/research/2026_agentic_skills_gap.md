# 2026 Agentic AI Skills Gap Analysis

Five additional skills that matter for Summit’s trajectory and are likely underrepresented right now are around RL, LLM infra, product thinking, change management, and standards/interop.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

## 6. Reinforcement learning and agent training

- Modern agent engineers are expected to understand RL basics (policies, rewards, exploration), multi-agent RL, and how to use logs to refine policies, not just prompts.[7][3][4]
- Gap: limited dedicated RL expertise focused on using Summit traces to iteratively train and improve policies or agent behaviors.

## 7. LLM infrastructure and optimization (LLM Ops)

- In 2026, AI engineers need skills in latency optimization, semantic caching, routing between models, and cost/accuracy tradeoffs at scale.[8][5][1]
- Gap: need a stronger LLM-ops mindset (vLLM-style infra, caching, routing policies) embedded in the core engineering team, not just basic API usage.

## 8. Product and UX thinking for agents-as-features

- Guides stress product sensibilities: designing agent experiences that fit real user workflows and deliver measurable value, not just technical demos.[9][10][11]
- Gap: more explicit product/UX ownership inside engineering for “agent as a feature” flows (onboarding, guardrails, explanations) across customer personas.

## 9. Change management and organizational adoption

- Orchestration specialists are expected to drive change management: mapping processes, onboarding teams, and building trust in agents.[2][12][9]
- Gap: little in-house capacity explicitly dedicated to rollout strategy, training content, and “first 90 days with Summit” playbooks.

## 10. Standards, interoperability, and protocol fluency

- Emerging practice emphasizes fluency with MCP/A2A, tool schemas, and cross-platform integration so agents don’t strand customers on one stack.[13][14][15]
- Gap: need deeper specialization in protocol and schema design so Summit can plug cleanly into other runtimes, gateways, and enterprise platforms.
