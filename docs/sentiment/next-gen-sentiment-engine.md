# Next-Generation Sentiment Engine Blueprint

## 1. Current Summit Capabilities (2025 Baseline)
- **Service composition**: `cognitive_insights_engine/sentiment_service` exposes a FastAPI router backed by a lightweight wrapper around HuggingFace sentiment pipelines. The model executes a text-only `pipeline("sentiment-analysis")`, returning labels, scores, and an influence map derived from neighbouring graph entities. Tests stub the transformer to validate endpoint wiring only.
- **Scope constraints**:
  - Single-modality text input with optional graph-neighbour hints; no audio, vision, biometric, or geospatial signals are ingested.
  - Influence propagation is heuristic—confidence is divided evenly amongst neighbours with no learned temporal, causal, or cross-modal context.
  - No privacy-preserving deployment, on-device adaptation, or federated coordination is defined.
  - Observability is limited to returning raw scores; there is no provenance, explanation graph, or traceability into contributing signals.

## 2. Opportunity Gap Versus State of the Art
- **Multimodal drift**: Research-grade systems increasingly fuse text, speech, video, biometrics, and environmental signals to capture latent affect. Summit currently orchestrates GPT workflows but lacks deep signal fusion and synchronized trace factor ingestion.
- **Temporal/geospatial awareness**: Leading platforms cluster sentiment changes across time and region, linking them to events. Summit does not automatically segment or align sentiment trajectories across feeds.
- **Agentic specialization**: Contemporary solutions deploy multi-agent assemblies (ASR, vision, knowledge, reasoning) coordinated via RAG or tool-use frameworks. Summit relies on a single FastAPI service with no agent orchestration.
- **Interpretability & governance**: Advanced engines generate causal stories, counterfactuals, and compliance artifacts. Summit only surfaces aggregate scores, limiting enterprise adoption in regulated settings.

## 3. Target Architecture: Trace-Factor Multimodal Engine
### 3.1 Modular Multi-Agent Mesh
- **Signal agents**: Dedicated ingest/analysis agents for text (LLMs/adapter-tuned transformers), speech (ASR + paralinguistic emotion), visuals (frame & micro-expression analyzers), biometrics (HRV, GSR, keystroke dynamics), and digital traces (network logs, device motion, transaction metadata).
- **Coordinator**: A policy-aware orchestrator schedules agents, handles asynchronous arrivals, and performs context merging via structured RAG and factor graphs.
- **Reasoning core**: Chain-of-thought sentiment synthesis combines agent evidence using probabilistic programming or neuro-symbolic aggregation, outputting sentiment, confidence, contributing factors, and dissenting signals.

### 3.2 Trace Factor Fabric
- **Unified feature store**: Extend Summit's workflow canvas to register multimodal connectors, normalize sampling rates, and persist aligned embeddings/metadata.
- **Semiotic fusion**: Encode non-verbal cues (emoji density, color palette, silence duration, camera motion) as first-class features stored alongside textual tokens.
- **Dynamic commonsense grounding**: Integrate contextual knowledge graphs and situational ontologies so sentiment judgements reference known events, roles, and norms.

### 3.3 Temporal-Geospatial Intelligence
- **Event segmentation**: Auto-cluster trace factors across time/space to detect inflection points, anomalies, and narrative cascades.
- **Predictive mapping**: Surface evolving sentiment heatmaps, trigger alerts when correlated signals (e.g., negative tone + biometric stress) cross thresholds, and feed downstream automation workflows.

### 3.4 Privacy-Preserving Deployment
- **Edge inference**: Support on-prem/edge execution of sensitive modality agents with secure enclave packaging.
- **Federated adaptation**: Ship adapter/fine-tune updates via secure aggregation; sensitive raw traces never leave the originating device or jurisdiction.
- **Auditability**: Provide per-trace lineage, signed model manifests, and configurable retention policies.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap
| Phase | Timeline | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P0 – Deep Audit** | Weeks 1-2 | Inventory text sentiment assets, identify integration points in workflow canvas, catalogue available data sources, and harden existing API tests.
| **P1 – Multimodal Foundations** | Weeks 3-8 | Build audio & vision ingestion blocks, deploy speech & video sentiment agents, implement feature alignment pipelines, and expose beta APIs.
| **P2 – Trace Factor Expansion** | Weeks 9-14 | Add biometric/device connectors, implement semiotic feature extraction, launch temporal-geospatial clustering services, and integrate interpretability dashboards.
| **P3 – Federated & Compliance** | Weeks 15-20 | Deliver edge deployment kits, federated training loop, privacy risk scoring, and compliance-ready reporting artifacts.
| **P4 – Predictive Intelligence** | Weeks 21-26 | Ship predictive incident mapping, cross-domain transfer evaluations, and automated workflow triggers with confidence/trace narratives.

## 5. Patent & Commercial Hooks
- **Modular agent lattice for trace-factor fusion** enabling asynchronous multimodal reasoning with provenance retention.
- **Semiotic + biometric sentiment codex** that quantifies silent cues, micro-expressions, and device telemetry as sentiment modifiers.
- **Federated commonsense grounding** combining local context embeddings with global affect knowledge bases without sharing raw signals.
- **Predictive sentiment incident radar** that correlates sentiment drift with operational events for proactive mitigation.

Delivering these innovations elevates Summit beyond orchestration into a defensible intelligence-grade sentiment platform suited for government, enterprise, and crisis-response operations.
