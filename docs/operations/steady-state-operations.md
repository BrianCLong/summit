# Steady-State Operations: Continuous Assurance

**Effective Date:** 2026-01-20
**Status:** Active
**Owner:** Jules (Release Captain)

This document defines the authoritative operational signals, metrics capture strategy, escalation protocols, and improvement backlog for the Summit repository. It is the single source of truth for maintaining GA quality without heroics.

## Phase 1: Continuous Signal Set (Authoritative)

The following table lists the **authoritative operational signals** that determine the health of the platform.

| Signal Category | Signal | Source | Owner | Review Cadence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Code Health** | Required checks pass rate | GitHub Actions (`check-run`) | `@acme/platform-core` | Weekly |
| **Code Health** | Typecheck/lint stability | `pnpm typecheck` / `lint` | `@acme/platform-core` | Weekly |
| **CI Health** | Queue depth | GitHub Actions API | `@acme/ops-team` | Daily |
| **CI Health** | Median time-to-green | `ci-health-monitor` | `@acme/ops-team` | Weekly |
| **CI Health** | Flake rate (top offenders) | `test-quarantine.json` | `@acme/ops-team` | Weekly |
| **Governance** | Drift status (PASS/FAIL + delta) | `governance-drift-check` | `@acme/security-team` | Monthly |
| **Governance** | Evidence freshness | `evidence-freshness.mjs` | `@acme/security-team` | Monthly |
| **Security** | Open high/critical alerts | CodeQL / Dependabot | `@acme/security-team` | Weekly |
| **Security** | Time-to-remediate (trend) | Security Dashboard | `@acme/security-team` | Weekly |

## Phase 2: Metrics Capture Plan (Non-Invasive)

We utilize existing tooling to capture these signals with minimal overhead.

### Code Health
*   **Source:** GitHub Actions run history and `pnpm` output.
*   **Capture Method:** `gh run list --workflow <workflow_name> --json conclusion`
*   **Frequency:** Weekly aggregation.
*   **Storage:** `docs/operations/snapshots/` (Weekly Snapshot).
*   **Thresholds:** < 95% pass rate requires investigation.

### CI Health
*   **Source:** `.github/workflows/ci-health-monitor.yml` and `ci-signal-gate.yml`.
*   **Capture Method:** Automated report generated by `ci-health-monitor` workflow.
*   **Frequency:** Daily (monitoring), Weekly (review).
*   **Storage:** CI Artifacts (`ci-health-report`).
*   **Thresholds:**
    *   Time-to-green > 45m (Warning)
    *   Flake rate > 5% (Blocker for new tests)

### Governance
*   **Source:** `scripts/drift-check.sh` and `.github/workflows/governance-drift-check.yml`.
*   **Capture Method:** Scheduled Cron Job.
*   **Frequency:** Monthly.
*   **Storage:** `GOVERNANCE_DRIFT.md` (Artifact).
*   **Thresholds:** Any FAILURE is a blocking issue for releases.

### Security
*   **Source:** GitHub Security Tab (Dependabot, CodeQL) and `scripts/security-scan.sh`.
*   **Capture Method:** `gh api /repos/:owner/:repo/dependabot/alerts`
*   **Frequency:** Weekly.
*   **Storage:** Security Compliance Report.
*   **Thresholds:** > 0 Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Stop).

## Phase 3: Alerting & Escalation (Minimal)

We prioritize low noise and clear ownership.

### Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Trigger | Response | Owner | Timebox |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1 (Page)** | CI Dead (0% pass rate), Security Critical, Drift Failure | Immediate Page | `@acme/ops-team` (CI) / `@acme/security-team` (Sec) | 1 hour ack |
| **P2 (Ticket)** | CI Slow (> 1h), Flake Rate > 10%, Governance Warning | Jira Ticket | `@acme/platform-core` | 24 hours |
| **P3 (Note)** | Lint drift, Minor deps outdated | Weekly Review Note | Signal Owner | Weekly |

**Rules of Engagement:**
*   **Fix Forward:** If a fix is small and verified.
*   **Rollback:** If impact is broad or fix is unknown.
*   **Quarantine:** If a specific test is flaking > 10% (move to `test-quarantine.json`).
