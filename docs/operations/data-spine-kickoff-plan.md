# Data Spine Kickoff Plan

This plan provides the launch checklist, scope, success criteria, execution cadence, and governance expectations for the Data Spine program.

## Kickoff Checklist

- **Definition of Ready artifacts** are authored, reviewed, and linked in the work tracker.
- **Architecture decision record (ADR)** pull request is opened and tagged for Security, SRE, and Product Operations sign-off.
- **Baseline dashboards and service level objectives (SLOs)** are created on day 1 to enable drift detection.
- **Synthetic probes** are stood up before the first deploy to validate availability, latency, and residency enforcement.
- **Opening change set** is fully validated so that the first pull request **merges cleanly without follow-up fixes**—"**ABSOLUTELY BE CERTAIN IT WILL MERGE CLEAN**" is treated as a hard gate.
- **Weekly evidence bundle** includes the ADR link, dashboard screenshot, release notes, and policy diff to satisfy compliance.

### Kickoff Ceremony Agenda & Pre-Work

1. **Pre-read distribution (T-3 days):** circulate DoR artifacts, draft ADR, and baseline policy summaries for asynchronous review.
2. **Live kickoff (T-0):** walk through the checklist, confirm owner assignments, review dependency status, and sign off on clean-merge readiness.
3. **Breakout alignment (T+1 day):** data platform, analytics engineering, and security each hold working sessions to finalize their execution backlogs and attach evidence expectations to Jira/Linear tickets.
4. **Day-one validation (T+1 day):** demonstrate dashboards, probes, and CDC smoke tests in the shared observability workspace and archive the recordings for compliance.

## Workstream Overview

- **Mission:** Deliver governed data movement with versioned schemas, lineage events, and residency enforcement across the Data Spine.
- **Success Metric:** Ship an end-to-end schema evolution that is observable, policy-compliant, and compatible for all producers and consumers.
- **Primary Stakeholders:** Data Platform, Analytics Engineering, Security Architecture, SRE, and Product Operations.
- **Key Dependencies:** Platform IAM provisioning, observability tooling access, and environment allocations for CDC routes and lineage services.

## MVP Scope (6 Weeks)

1. **Schema Registry (Avro/Protobuf)**
   - Semantic versioning contracts enforced with pre-publish compatibility checks and linting.
   - CLI workflows for publish/validate integrated into CI.
2. **Lineage Collection**
   - OpenLineage-compatible event emitter shipping events to the lineage bus.
   - Basic lineage UI that surfaces dataset, job, and policy tags.
3. **Change Data Capture (CDC)**
   - Continuous replication from OLTP systems into the analytics sink.
   - Residency policy enforcement on all CDC routes with deny-by-default posture.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

- Comprehensive **data classification inventory** is documented and approved.
- **Residency matrix** for all datasets and sinks is reviewed and signed off by Security.
- **Target sinks** are defined with owners, IAM model, and data retention expectations.
- **Success metrics** (SLOs, synthetic probes) are instrumented and observable.
- **Escalation paths** for residency or classification violations are codified with on-call coverage.
- **Backlog hygiene:** Stories reference schema subjects, CDC routes, and lineage coverage checklists with acceptance criteria attached.
- **Dependency clearance:** IAM, network connectivity, and infrastructure quotas are confirmed available in the deployment window.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

- Schema version `vX.Y` is deployed with producers and consumers validated for compatibility.
- Lineage views demonstrate end-to-end data flow with residency and classification context.
- CDC lag and residency dashboards remain within SLO targets for two consecutive deployments.
- Operational runbooks, policy documentation, and post-deploy evidence are published.
- On-call playbooks are updated, tested, and linked to alert policies for schema registry, lineage emitter, and CDC connectors.

## Security Gates & Compliance Controls

- All personally identifiable information (PII) fields are tagged in schemas and lineage metadata.
- Residency guard rails deny data egress to disallowed regions; violations page on-call within five minutes.
- Retention policies are encoded in schema metadata and enforced via automated lifecycle jobs.
- ADR, policy diffs, and test evidence are linked in the weekly compliance packet.
- CDC pipelines are continuously scanned for unauthorized sinks, with automated quarantining of newly detected endpoints until reviewed.
- Security runbooks include breach notification procedures aligned with residency jurisdictions and contractual SLAs.

## Evidence & Reporting

- **Schema diffs:** Attach to each release ticket and store in the registry changelog.
- **Lineage screenshots:** Capture end-to-end flow showing source → transformations → sinks.
- **CDC lag graphs:** Provide weekly trend with commentary on spikes or mitigation steps.
- **Residency audit trail:** Export policy evaluation logs for each pipeline deployment.
- **Weekly status packet:** Bundle ADR link, dashboard screenshot, release notes, and policy diff for audit traceability.
- **Escalation log:** Record breaches, mitigation actions, and resolution timestamps for SRE/Security review.
- **Launch readiness ledger:** Track completion of DoR/DoD checkpoints, stakeholder sign-offs, and outstanding follow-ups.

## Operational Controls & Escalations

- **Security gates:** Residency enforcement tested with synthetic probes before every deploy; deny-by-default posture remains active during incidents.
- **Incident response:** Publish on-call rotation covering CDC, lineage, and schema services with a 15-minute acknowledgement target.
- **Backout strategy:** Maintain replayable CDC checkpoints and schema rollback scripts validated in staging each sprint.
- **Stakeholder communications:** Product Operations circulates weekly status with evidence attachments, risk call-outs, and decision requests.
- **Chaos and failure drills:** Run quarterly residency gate chaos tests and monthly lineage emitter failover exercises with findings documented.
- **Runbook validation:** Simulate CDC replay and schema rollback at least once per sprint with sign-off recorded in the evidence ledger.
