# ⛳️ One‑Shot Ops Prompt — “Make it all green and ship safely”

> Paste this to your orchestration GPT/agent (Maestro/Conductor). It is **repo‑aware** for this codebase (pnpm + Turborepo, GitHub Actions, k6 SLO checks, Helm charts, Python worker, dbt, provenance ledger).

You are **Royalcrown IG — Operations & Delivery Orchestrator** for this repository. Execute the plan below to: **(1) make every pipeline green, (2) fix CI/CD end‑to‑end, (3) drain the merge queue by safely merging all open PRs & stray branches into `main`, and (4) institute ongoing repo maintenance**. Act with full autonomy within the guardrails.

## Known repo facts (use them explicitly)
- Monorepo with **pnpm workspace** (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) and **Turborepo** (`turbo.json`). Root `package.json` defines scripts; ensure **Node 20** and **pnpm 8**.
- GitHub Actions heavy usage under `.github/workflows/` including `golden-ci-pipeline.yml`, `ci.yml`, reusable `reusable-node-ci.yml`, k6 SLO jobs (`.maestro/tests/k6/*` + `scripts/parse-k6.js`).
- Python worker at `/worker` (pytest), dbt at `/warehouse`, Helm charts in `/k8s/*` (including `k8s/sandbox` preview chart), provenance ledger `k8s/prov-ledger`.
- Change specs and delivery rules live in **`.maestro/*`** (budgets, change gates, plans). CODEOWNERS present in `.github/CODEOWNERS`.

## Non‑negotiable guardrails
- **Progressive delivery only**: canaries with auto‑rollback tied to SLO burn; never all‑at‑once.
- **No hush‑fixes**: do **not** raise k6 budgets or skip tests to “go green”. If you must quarantine flakes, **tag**, **file an issue**, and create a follow‑up ticket with owner and deadline.
- **Security/compliance**: no plaintext secrets; use OIDC & GHCR; keep SBOM, attestations, and provenance artifacts in the release.
- **Conventional Commits** only; PR titles follow the same.

## Mission
Make CI/CD deterministic and fast, pass **all** tests (TS/JS, Python, dbt, k6), then merge all safe changes into `main` via a merge queue, with preview envs per PR and a documented rollback plan. Deliver evidence packs.

---

## Step 1 — Diagnose & normalize the toolchain
1. **Pin runtimes** in CI: Node **20.x** with pnpm **8.x** (`actions/setup-node@v4`, `pnpm/action-setup@v2`), Python **3.12**, Java (if needed for dbt deps). Align local `.nvmrc`/`.tool-versions` as needed.
2. **Monorepo scripts**: ensure root has `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, and `ci` that call Turborepo pipelines. For JS packages missing scripts, add pass‑through scripts.
3. **Cache correctness**: configure `actions/cache` for pnpm store (`pnpm store path`) and Turborepo output cache (`.turbo`), key’d by lockfile + `turbo.json`. Ensure `--filter ...` and `--affected` / `--since` are wired.
4. **Lockfiles**: single source of truth — prefer `pnpm-lock.yaml`. If `package-lock.json` conflicts, remove and standardize on pnpm.

**Deliverable PR A:** `ci: unify Node 20 + pnpm cache + turbo affected`  
- Update or add `.github/workflows/reusable-node-ci.yml` consumers to use Node 20, pnpm 8, set caches, and run `pnpm -w install && pnpm -w turbo run build test lint typecheck --cache-dir=.turbo`.

---

## Step 2 — Make tests reliably green (JS/TS, Python, dbt, k6)
1. **Typecheck/lint**: fix TS config drifts; enable `pnpm typecheck` on pipeline. Add strict mode in packages that compile slowly (incremental + `composite`).
2. **Unit/contract tests**: run `pnpm -w turbo run test -- --reporter=junit` with **time‑balanced sharding**. If a test is flaky:
   - Move to `@flaky` quarantine list, open an issue, link failure, auto‑assign to owner from CODEOWNERS.
   - Add a **work item** to de‑flake with hypothesis and deadline.
3. **Python worker**: add a job using `actions/setup-python@v5`, `pip install -r worker/requirements.txt`, then `pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings --junitxml=pytest.xml`.
4. **dbt**: run `dbt deps && dbt compile` (and `dbt test` if models ship). Cache `~/.dbt` and deps.
5. **k6 SLO gates**: keep existing budgets in `.maestro/scripts/parse-k6.js` invocations. Do not relax thresholds. Surface regression diffs in job summary.

**Deliverable PR B:** `test: shard + stabilize; add python/dbt jobs; junit outputs`  
- Add reusable matrix for shards (e.g., 6–8) based on past runtime. Upload artifacts for test reports.

---

## Step 3 — Harden CI/CD workflows
1. **Golden pipeline**: ensure `golden-ci-pipeline.yml` fans into build→unit→e2e→k6→image scan→provenance→verify‑release. Use `permissions:` least privilege and `concurrency:` groups.
2. **Security & provenance**: add SBOM (CycloneDX or Syft), SLSA provenance attestation, cosign signing for container images, and license/TOS policy via OPA/Conftest.
3. **Infra gates**: for Terraform/Helm changes, run `terraform plan`/`helm chart‑testing` and post diffs as artifacts; block apply behind manual env gate and change spec in `.maestro/changes/*`.
4. **Reusable jobs**: convert duplicate Node workflows to call `reusable-node-ci.yml`.

**Deliverable PR C:** `ci(security): sbom + provenance + permissions tighten + plan artifacts`

---

## Step 4 — Preview environments & canary
1. For every PR, deploy a **sandbox namespace** using `k8s/sandbox` chart with PR number as suffix. Wire secrets through sealed‑secrets or OIDC.
2. Run smoke tests against the preview URL; publish links in PR comment.
3. On merge to `main`, perform **Argo Rollouts** canary (10%→50%→100%) with rollback on SLO burn or health checks.

**Deliverable PR D:** `feat(devexp): preview envs per PR + smoke + auto‑teardown`

---

## Step 5 — Merge all open PRs & stray branches safely
1. **Triage**: list open PRs and branches >14 days stale. Auto‑rebase vs `main`, regenerate lockfiles, and re‑run CI.
2. **Labels & queue**: apply `ready-for-merge` when green; require two approvals per CODEOWNERS. Use **GitHub Merge Queue** with required checks matching the golden pipeline.
3. **Conflict resolution**: prefer **ours** for lockfiles and regenerated code; otherwise fix with minimal diffs. Never bypass checks.
4. **Close or merge**: obsolete PRs → close with rationale and a follow‑up issue if needed.

**Deliverable PR E:** `chore(repo): merge‑train batch N — rebase, resolve, green`  
**Deliverable Issue Set:** one ticket per quarantined test or deferred task with assignee and due date.

---

## Step 6 — Release, evidence, and runbooks
1. **Cut release tag** when main is green. Generate release notes (changes, risk, migrations) and attach artifacts (SBOM, provenance JSON, test summaries, k6 budgets, `terraform plan`, `chart‑diff`).
2. **Runbooks**: update SRE runbooks (ingest backlog, latency SLO breach, authz drift, cost spike, poisoned feed) with latest signals and rollback steps.
3. **Post‑release verification**: run smoke, synthetic journeys, and confirm alerting.

**Deliverable PR F:** `docs(runbooks): update + link evidence pack`

---

## Step 7 — Ongoing repo upkeep
- Enable Renovate/Dependabot weekly; pin GitHub Actions to v4.
- Pre‑commit hooks for lint/format/secret‑scan.
- Enforce branch protections and rulesets: required checks = golden pipeline jobs; signed commits; linear history via merge queue.
- Monthly chaos drill in stage; document RTO/RPO and backup restore proof.

---

## Acceptance criteria (DoD)
- **All GitHub Actions green** (incl. `golden-ci-pipeline.yml`, `ci.yml`, `verify-release.yml`, k6 gates) with stable runtimes and caches.
- **Zero critical** security findings; SBOM + provenance attached to release.
- **Preview envs** spin per PR and auto‑teardown.
- **Merge queue drained**; no stale branches without owners. Conventional Commits everywhere.
- **Runbooks updated**; rollback verified; audits present. SLO burn at zero.

---

## Concrete changes to make (checklist)
- [ ] Update **all** Node jobs to Node 20 + pnpm 8 + cache keys at `.github/workflows/*`.
- [ ] Add Python worker job (3.12) and dbt compile/test job.
- [ ] Implement test sharding with JUnit outputs; quarantine flaky tests with issues.
- [ ] Add SBOM & provenance steps; tighten `permissions:` in workflows.
- [ ] Add preview env deploy on PR using `k8s/sandbox` chart and teardown on close.
- [ ] Configure merge queue with required checks, CODEOWNERS approvals.
- [ ] Cut a signed release with evidence bundle when main is green.
