# Summit (IntelGraph) Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the Summit (IntelGraph) platform against our two-week release cadence managed by Jules. For scheduling deta
ils and process, see the [Release Cadence section in the README](../README.md#-release-cadence) and the supporting [Release Cad
ence & Process guide](RELEASE_CADENCE.md).

## Delivered: v2.0.0 (December 2025)

- **Enterprise-grade foundation**: Multi-tier caching, advanced observability, and hardened security controls.
- **AI & analytics**: Multimodal extraction, governance-aware Copilot responses, and accelerated entity resolution.
- **Deployment maturity**: Golden Path CI, semantic versioning, and migration tooling for existing tenants.

## Current (Q4 2025): Strategic Sprints 25–28

Focus: post-v2.0.0 stabilization and customer onboarding at scale.

- **Reliability & scale**: Graph ingestion resilience, TimescaleDB telemetry tuning, and proactive alerting for ingestion jobs.
- **Governance automation**: Expanded OPA policy coverage, evidence capture for AI outputs, and rulebook-aligned controls.
- **Copilot & workflows**: Narrative simulation improvements, faster query planning, and analyst feedback loops in the UI.
- **Release target**: v2.0.1 stabilization drops throughout the sprint train; v2.1.0 feature cut at Sprint 28 end.

## Near-Term (Q1 2026): Strategic Sprints 29–32

Focus: platform elasticity and connector velocity.

- **Connector expansion**: STIX/TAXII and RSS/Atom bundles with automated schema validation.
- **Performance & cost**: Adaptive caching for high-churn investigations and workload-aware queue autoscaling.
- **Security posture**: Zero-trust defaults for tenant isolation and expanded audit lineage for cross-graph actions.
- **Release target**: v2.2.0 with connector packs and resilience upgrades.

## Horizon (H1 2026): Strategic Sprints 33–38

Focus: extensibility and mission-grade collaboration.

- **Plugin ecosystem**: Marketplace-ready plugin lifecycle with signed artifacts and runtime isolation.
- **Collaboration & review**: Multi-analyst workcells, shared graph annotations, and supervisory approval flows.
- **Predictive intelligence**: Advanced pattern simulation with reinforced governance verdicts.
- **Release target**: v2.3.x line with progressive feature flags to minimize risk during rollout.
