# Incident Note: CVE-2026-25145 (Melange Path Traversal)

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Severity:** High
**Component:** `melange` (APK builder)

## Description
A path traversal vulnerability in `melange` allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the host filesystem into the generated SBOM license text field. This can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g., secrets, source code) via the build artifact.

## Impact
- **Exfiltration:** Secrets or code from the build environment can be leaked in the SBOM.
- **Supply Chain:** Consumers of the SBOM might inadvertently ingest malicious or sensitive content.

## Mitigation
- **Upgrade:** Ensure `melange` version is **>= 0.40.3**.
- **Lint:** Scan generated SBOMs for path traversal indicators (`../`, `/etc/`) and large license text blobs.

## Summit Status
- **Usage:** No explicit usage of `melange` found in the repository as of 2026-02-05.
- **Prevention:** Added policy gate to block vulnerable versions if introduced.
