# TLS Policy and Termination Points

This document outlines the Transport Layer Security (TLS) policy for [Company Name] systems, including supported versions, cipher suites, and termination points.

## 1. TLS Version Enforcement

All internal and external communication channels must enforce a minimum of **TLS 1.2**. TLS 1.3 is preferred where supported by all communicating parties.

## 2. Approved Cipher Suites

Only strong, forward-secret cipher suites are permitted. The following cipher suites are approved for use:

- `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` (TLS 1.3)
- `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` (TLS 1.3)
- `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` (TLS 1.3)
- `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` (TLS 1.2)
- `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` (TLS 1.2)
- `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` (TLS 1.2)
- `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` (TLS 1.2)

Weak or deprecated cipher suites (e.g., those using RC4, 3DES, or SHA1 for HMAC) are strictly forbidden.

## 3. TLS Termination Points

TLS connections are terminated at the earliest possible point in the network path to ensure encrypted communication throughout the infrastructure.

### 3.1. External Traffic

- **Ingress/Load Balancer**: All incoming external traffic is terminated at the edge load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, Nginx Ingress Controller, Traefik). Certificates are managed via [Specify Certificate Management, e.g., AWS Certificate Manager, cert-manager].

### 3.2. Internal Service-to-Service Communication

- **Service Mesh**: For services within the Kubernetes cluster, mTLS (mutual TLS) is enforced via a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd). This ensures all inter-service communication is encrypted and authenticated.
- **Direct Connections**: For services not part of the service mesh (e.g., direct database connections), TLS is configured directly at the application layer or database client.

### 3.3. Database Connections

- **PostgreSQL**: Connections to PostgreSQL databases are encrypted using TLS. `rds.force_ssl=on` is enabled for AWS RDS instances, or equivalent TLS configurations are applied for self-managed instances.
- **Redis**: Connections to Redis instances are encrypted using TLS. Authentication is also required.

## 4. Certificate Management

- All TLS certificates must be issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- Certificates are automatically renewed and rotated to prevent expiration.

## 5. Audit and Monitoring

- TLS configurations are regularly audited for compliance with this policy.
- Monitoring is in place to detect and alert on non-compliant TLS usage or certificate expiration.
