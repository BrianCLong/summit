# SECURITY ADVISORY: CVE-2026-21858 (Ni8mare) - n8n Remote Code Execution

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 10.0)
**CVE:** CVE-2026-21858
**Nickname:** Ni8mare

## Summary

A critical unauthenticated vulnerability (CVE-2026-21858) has been identified in the n8n workflow automation platform. This vulnerability, nicknamed "Ni8mare", allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on self-hosted n8n instances by manipulating request parsing of webhook and form inputs.

## Impact on Summit Platform

The Summit platform utilizes n8n for critical developer productivity workflows, including automated code generation, PR reviews, and CI/CD self-healing. While the default documentation points to n8n Cloud (which is patched), any **self-hosted** n8n instance used in conjunction with this repository is at extreme risk if it falls within the affected version range.

Compromise of an n8n instance often provides attackers with:
- Access to GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- Access to Groq/AI API keys
- Access to internal systems connected via n8n
- Full control over the host running n8n

## Affected Versions

- All n8n versions from **1.65.0** up to (but not including) **1.121.0** are vulnerable.

## Remediation

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **Upgrade n8n:** Update your n8n instance to version **1.121.0** or later immediately.
2. **Audit Credentials:** If you were running a vulnerable version, assume compromise. Rotate all credentials stored in n8n, including:
   - GitHub PATs
   - Groq API keys
   - Slack Webhook URLs
   - Database credentials
3. **Audit Webhooks:** Review all exposed webhook and form endpoints.
