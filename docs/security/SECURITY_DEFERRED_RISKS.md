| SEC-DEFER-0001 | Secret-pattern matches remain in documentation/examples and test fixtures after repo scan. | Governed Exceptions required for example/test data; repository-wide redaction needs governance review to avoid breaking fixtures and validation tests. | Security + Platform | Classify each match, redact non-test docs, and update allowlists/policy scans to distinguish fixtures.               | 2026-02-01  |
| SEC-DEFER-0002 | Dependency audit and lint/test sweeps not executed under no-network constraint.            | Intentionally constrained by zero-network requirement for this execution window.                                                                       | Release Captain     | Re-run `pnpm -r install`, `pnpm -r audit --audit-level=low`, `pnpm -r lint`, and `pnpm -r test` with network access. | 2026-01-15  |
