This work is a clean-room scaffold derived from the public summary of:

- **Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning for Active Latent Planning** (arXiv:2601.21598)

Concepts used in this scaffold, expressed in original wording:

- Use conditional VAE supervision to shape a smoother latent token space.
- Add an auxiliary coherence reward based on consistency between decoded latent contents.
