# IntelGraph Maestro Conductor — Metorial Surpass Plan (90-Day Roadmap)

## Vision
Deliver a Maestro Conductor platform that eclipses Metorial across performance, security, observability, developer experience, and go-to-market integration with CompanyOS Switchboard and IntelGraph intelligence surfaces.

## Guiding Principles
- Evidence-first: Every milestone produces auditable artifacts (benchmarks, policy sims, replay proofs).
- Incremental shipping: Feature flags and staged rollouts aligned with IntelGraph SLO guardrails and cost caps.
- Shared fabric: Runtime, observability, and marketplace workstreams plug into CompanyOS Switchboard for operator workflows and into IntelGraph intel pipelines for data products.

## Phase 0–2 Weeks — Foundations
- Finalize ADR-2025-09-30 (runtime pooler) and ADR-2025-09-30 (replay engine).
- Prototype Firecracker pooler with warm worker cache, integrate scoped capability tokens issued by Switchboard IAM.
- Stand up OpenTelemetry spine with redaction filters; stream traces to existing observability cluster.
- Launch SDK alpha for TypeScript & Python with local emulator bridging to CompanyOS feature flags.
- Kick off benchmarking harness (GitHub, Playwright) to capture baseline vs. Metorial.

## Phase 3–6 Weeks — Parity Plus
- Harden deterministic replay v1 with stub catalog and session viewer inside Switchboard (operator console).
- Extend marketplace ingestion to auto-badge connectors; sync catalog to CompanyOS directories and IntelGraph registry.
- Implement per-tenant KMS wrap for secrets, SBOM signature verification for tool bundles.
- Publish benchmark v1 results internally; prep blog outline.

## Phase 7–10 Weeks — Exceed
- Ship replay v2 (causal diff) with cross-version comparison and Switchboard alerting when divergences occur.
- Launch remote server registry APIs for health/quota introspection; expose cost controls and burst fairness toggles.
- Deliver CLI (init/test/deploy/replay) bundling emulator, fixtures, and contract tests.
- Integrate adaptive concurrency + budget alerts with CompanyOS cost guardrails.

## Phase 11–13 Weeks — Trust & GTM
- Complete provenance ledger UI, retention workflows, and warrant-bound exports.
- Publish public benchmark shootout with raw data, blog, and marketing assets (Metorial comparison deck).
- Align with Go-To-Market to onboard launch partners (GitHub, Playwright, Exa, Cloudflare, Firecrawl).
- Run live demo tying Maestro Conductor + CompanyOS Switchboard dashboards + IntelGraph insights.

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams
- Security: OPA ABAC, WebAuthn console, mTLS enforcement, sandbox syscall filters.
- Compliance: SOC2 prep update, RTBF automation, policy simulation gating deployments.
- Developer Experience: SDKs (TS/Py/Go/Rust), emulator, fixture generator, contract tests, docs refresh.
- Observability: OTEL collector scaling, deterministic replay fidelity KPI, SLO dashboards, cost telemetry.

## Milestone Exit Criteria
- Cold start p95 ≤ 300 ms with evidence in `benchmarks/runtime/pooler-baseline.md`.
- Session start p95 ≤ 250 ms, p99 ≤ 700 ms surfaced on OTEL dashboard.
- Deterministic replay ≥95% fidelity; causal diff available in Switchboard.
- Marketplace badges live with ≥90% catalog coverage and automated conformance proof.
- Provenance ledger + RTBF workflows audited; compliance pack ready.
- Public benchmark blog + dashboard launched with signed datasets.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Firecracker kernel tuning requires Infra Ops (risk: delay; mitigation: dedicated pairing).
- Replay storage costs may spike (mitigation: tiered retention, compression).
- Marketplace ingestion breadth could outpace review capacity (mitigation: badge automation + partner SLAs).
- WebAuthn rollout may impact legacy users (mitigation: phased opt-in + support playbook).

## Communications & GTM Alignment
- Weekly demo cadence feeding into CompanyOS Switchboard status board.
- Bi-weekly benchmark updates shared with exec stakeholders.
- Marketing alignment for summit launch: `docs/blog/benchmark-shootout.md`, pricing page updates, customer webinars.
