# Summit 2027-2030 Strategic Independence Roadmap

## Purpose
This roadmap translates the 2027-2030 unicorn vision into an execution-ready plan that balances hypergrowth with an independence path. It aligns product, go-to-market, and operating model milestones to support both IPO readiness and durable profitability.

## North Star Outcomes (2030)
- $1B+ ARR with ≥50% gross margin and ≥20% operating margin.
- 10k customers across public sector, MSSPs, and regulated enterprises; 1k employees with global coverage.
- Category-defining “Palantir for OSINT + sovereign AI graphs” platform with defensible data, patent, and network moats.
- Dual-path exit optionality: IPO at $10B-$15B+ valuation or profitable independence with $500M+ FCF.

## Financial & Headcount Trajectory
- **2027:** $100M ARR; ~200 FTE; IPO S-1 draft and audit readiness.
- **2028:** $300M ARR; ~500 FTE; direct listing preparation and global sales coverage.
- **2029:** $750M ARR; ~1,000 FTE; expansion into APAC/LatAm and deeper vertical plays.
- **2030:** $1.5B ARR; ~2,000 FTE; sovereign AI leader with durable profitability.

## Product & Platform Evolution
- **v4 (2027): Multi-cloud sovereign graph fabric**
  - Region-pinned data planes (EU, GCC, Fed) with BYOK/HSM and provable residency.
  - OSINT ingestion mesh with zero-trust connectors and lattice/PQC-ready crypto envelopes.
- **v5 (2028): Agent mesh + mission automation**
  - 100-agent autonomous intel swarms with human-in-the-loop guardrails, transparent chain-of-custody, and prov-ledger attestations.
  - Vertical SaaS packs (Cyber, Finance, Supply Chain) with templated playbooks and outcomes SLAs.
- **v6 (2029-2030): Quantum-resilient sovereign graphs**
  - PQC primitives default-on; lattice-graph analytics; adaptive cost guardrails and cloud arbitrage.
  - Federated intel-sharing network across 1k+ orgs with fine-grained trust contracts and policy-compliant data exchanges.

## Execution Phases & Critical Bets
- **Phase 1: Unicorn Ignition (2026-2027)**
  - Land $100M ARR via EU/GCC sovereign graphs ($50M pipeline), vertical SaaS ($30M), and classified PQC-ready enclaves ($20M).
  - Stand up EKS multi-region baseline (terraform apply -var="regions=global"), FedRAMP Moderate controls, and S-1 readiness program.
- **Phase 2: Global Domination (2028-2029)**
  - Expand to APAC/LatAm; 50% non-US revenue; channel scale with 100+ MSSPs and 20 hyperscalers.
  - Launch agent mesh (v5) and cost guard/auto-tuning to protect margins during scale.
- **Phase 3: Category Creator (2030+)**
  - Defensibility: 50+ patents across agent-graph and sovereign AI; 10B-node/1T-edge data moat; federated network effects across 1k orgs.
  - Exit optionality: IPO, perpetual independence (50% margins), or strategic at $20B+.

## Go-To-Market & Customer Motions
- **Segments**: Public sector/FedRAMP, regulated enterprises (finance, pharma, critical supply chain), and MSSP/partner ecosystem.
- **Land**: Sovereign graph pilots with measurable mission outcomes; compliance-led sales (data residency, PQC posture, auditability).
- **Expand**: Agent swarm playbooks, vertical SaaS modules, and cross-region intel exchanges with usage-based pricing.
- **Channels**: Joint reference architectures with hyperscalers; 2-tier MSSP program with incentives tied to outcomes and compliance scores.

## Operating Model & Culture
- Systems-minded, disinformation-resistant teams; Colorado HQ with regional pods (EU, GCC, APAC, LatAm).
- 4-in-the-box leadership for each region (GM, Sales, Delivery, Compliance) with shared platform PM/Eng.
- Talent ramp: bootstrap core + AI agents (2026) → 200 FTE (2027) → 500 (2028) → 1k (2029) → 2k (2030).
- Governance: quarterly market reality checks (pivot to enterprise-only if < $10M ARR in 2026; shift to profitability path if unicorn trajectory misses in 2027).

## Risk, Controls, and Killswitches
- **Regulatory blocks**: fall back to commercial-only SaaS with strict residency and export controls.
- **Margin risk**: automated cost guardrails, workload placement arbitration, and contract-level floor pricing.
- **Security/Integrity**: PQC-by-default by 2028; continuous attestations (SBOM, SLSA), adversarial testing, and red/blue simulations on agent swarms.
- **Execution drift**: milestone gates tied to ARR run-rate, deployment velocity, and compliance scorecards.

## Innovation Frontiers (Forward-Looking)
- Adaptive agent collectives that self-tune based on mission feedback and trust scores.
- Lattice-graph analytics for post-quantum resilience and anomaly detection on encrypted graphs.
- Sovereign graph exchange standard to become the default for intergovernmental intel collaboration.

## Success Metrics & Telemetry
- ARR growth, CAC payback, and NRR segmented by geo/vertical.
- Deployment-to-value time, mission outcome SLAs, and analyst leverage (≥10x) from agent swarms.
- Compliance posture (FedRAMP/FISMA/ISO), residency adherence, and cryptographic policy coverage.
- Platform reliability: SLOs on ingest latency, graph query P99, agent action success, and cross-region replication.

## Next Steps (H1 2026)
- Finalize region-pinned reference architectures (EU, GCC, Fed) and secure HSM/BYOK options.
- Launch sovereign graph lighthouse customers with measurable ROI and publish case studies.
- Stand up agent swarm alpha with provenance ledger, red-team/blue-team exercises, and safety guardrails.
- Prepare IPO/independence dual-track with audit readiness, data room, and board reporting cadence.
