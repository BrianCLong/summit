# Forward Generalization Strategy

## Position

Summit establishes a durable moat by reusing the same graph/orchestration/provenance core across
multiple intelligence domains. This strategy is aligned to the Summit Readiness Assertion and the
Law of Consistency.

## Core Moat Components

1. **GraphRAG + IntelGraph**: network effects from multi-tenant graph intelligence.
2. **Maestro Orchestration**: durable agentic workflows independent of model churn.
3. **Compliance + Provenance**: enterprise wedge with evidence-first determinism.
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: reusable HITL patterns, approval gates, and audit trails.
5. **Marketplace Effect**: shared playbooks/rules/enrichments under signed policy.

## Reusable Primitives

- Canonical event schema with provenance fields.
- Deterministic evidence bundles per job.
- Policy-as-code gates for attribution, privacy, and residency.
- Cross-domain playbooks and runbooks with HITL checkpoints.

## Adjacent Domains (Immediate Expansion)

- Supply chain intelligence.
- Geopolitical risk monitoring.
- Brand protection and narrative risk.

## Execution Commitments

- Domain overlays extend, never fork, the core graph and orchestration layers.
- Evidence artifacts are required for every analytic job.
- Multi-tenant isolation remains the default and is never relaxed.

## Go/No-Go Gates

- Determinism replays must be hash-identical.
- Privacy linting must pass with default-safe features.
- HITL gates must block actor-level exports without approval.
