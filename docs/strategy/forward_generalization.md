# Forward Generalization Strategy

## Objective

Generalize Summit's core graph-orchestration-provenance stack across adjacent intelligence domains
without weakening determinism, governance, or tenant isolation.

## Reusable Primitives

- IntelGraph canonical entities, relations, and temporal provenance
- Maestro policy-gated orchestration with HITL breakpoints
- CompanyOS operational memory for runbooks, adjudications, and calibration notes
- Evidence-first outputs (`report.json`, `metrics.json`, `stamp.json`)

## Moat Thesis

Durable advantage comes from compounded system effects:

1. GraphRAG retrieval quality improves with cumulative, governed graph structure.
2. Agentic orchestration captures institutional process logic beyond model choice.
3. Provenance/compliance artifacts convert operational trust into procurement leverage.
4. Multi-tenant playbook sharing compounds solution velocity when policy-safe.

## Expansion Domains

- Supply chain intelligence
- Geopolitical risk monitoring
- Brand and narrative protection
- Fraud and adversarial campaign detection

## Gating Requirements For New Domain Extensions

- Determinism replay must pass
- Residency and tenant-isolation controls must pass
- Policy-as-code gates must exist for high-risk actions
- Evidence artifacts must be generated by CI
