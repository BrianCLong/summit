# AI-Native Operating Model Gaps (Enterprise Field Scan)

**Authority**: Summit Strategy Office
**Status**: Active execution input
**Alignment**: [Summit Readiness Assertion](../SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md)

## Executive Signal

AI-native enterprise operating models are emerging, yet critical gaps remain unresolved. The present landscape shows fragmented ownership, reactive governance, weak integration readiness, and stalled scale-out from pilots. Summit converts these gaps into governed, productized capabilities with explicit decision rights, policy-as-code controls, and lifecycle ownership.

---

## 23rd-Order Implication Ladder (Imputed Intent)

1. Ownership ambiguity forces governance into consensus, which slows decisions and dilutes accountability.
2. Diluted accountability weakens exception handling, turning safety into a best-effort process.
3. Best-effort safety increases audit variability, which erodes regulator trust.
4. Lower regulator trust expands oversight requirements, increasing compliance drag.
5. Increased compliance drag delays agent deployment, reducing operational learning velocity.
6. Lower learning velocity prevents baseline stabilization, causing model drift.
7. Model drift increases exception volume, overwhelming manual oversight.
8. Oversight overload forces ad hoc bypasses, rebranding legacy gaps as governed exceptions.
9. Governed exceptions without authority mapping amplify cross-team conflict.
10. Cross-team conflict fragments data ownership, lowering data readiness.
11. Poor data readiness blocks integration, which collapses agent reliability.
12. Reliability collapse undermines business KPIs, triggering budget volatility.
13. Budget volatility discourages long-term automation investments.
14. Underinvestment delays control plane maturity, perpetuating reactive governance.
15. Reactive governance weakens explainability, eroding human trust.
16. Low trust increases human override frequency, destabilizing agent workflows.
17. Workflow instability reduces reuse, forcing bespoke implementations.
18. Bespoke implementations create policy inconsistency and non-portable controls.
19. Inconsistent controls prevent enterprise-wide rollout, stalling scale.
20. Stalled scale reduces the evidence base for governance improvements.
21. Limited evidence keeps standards informal, weakening authority files.
22. Weak authority files allow definition drift, reintroducing ownership ambiguity.
23. Ownership ambiguity cycles back into delayed decommissioning decisions, compounding risk exposure.

## Gap 1: Clear Ownership and Decision Rights

**Present state**: Enterprise AI strategy, risk, and delivery ownership is fragmented across product, data, engineering, and risk. Decision rights for authorizing, overriding, or decommissioning agents are undefined.

**Summit move**: Establish explicit authority surfaces for agent ownership, decommission rights, and risk acceptance. Encode these rights into governance graphs and policy-as-code gates, and enforce them throughout the agent lifecycle.

---

## Gap 2: Embedded, Continuous Governance

**Present state**: Governance is reactive. Compliance arrives late, and most systems lack always-on control agents that log, explain, and constrain other agents in real time.

**Summit move**: Ship a control plane with policy-aware guardrails and immutable audit trails that operate from day zero. Every agent action is explained, constrained, and logged as a governed exception or compliant event.

---

## Gap 3: Integration and Data-Readiness for Agents

**Present state**: Legacy systems, missing APIs, and siloed data block agent workflows. There is no standardized “agent-ready” middleware that absorbs integration risk.

**Summit move**: Deliver a standardized integration layer that abstracts legacy complexity into governed capabilities. Integration evidence and data readiness are first-class artifacts in the execution graph.

---

## Gap 4: From Pilots to Scaled Capabilities

**Present state**: Enterprises run pilots that stall before enterprise scale because ownership and lifecycle patterns are missing. Planning methods do not align with probabilistic, experiment-heavy agent systems.

**Summit move**: Package lifecycle patterns for roadmap, budgeting, KPI ownership, and operational handoff. Every pilot is bound to a scale-out gate with explicit owners and exit criteria.

---

## Gap 5: Human Roles, Skills, and Trust Infrastructure

**Present state**: “Human above the loop” roles are described but not operationalized. Trust infrastructure is weak: audit trails, explanations, and training paths are inconsistent.

**Summit move**: Codify operator roles, training paths, and decision authority. Provide explainability, provenance, and audit artifacts that non-technical stakeholders use without interpretation.

---

## Gap 6: Standardized AI Operating-System Blueprints

**Present state**: Few organizations have an AI-specific operating model with decision rights, governance layers, and lifecycle gates. There is no widely adopted AI OS blueprint.

**Summit move**: Publish a reference “AI OS” blueprint with enforceable definitions, authority files, and lifecycle gates. This blueprint is built for adoption, adaptation, and regulated environments.

---

## Summit Differentiation: Convert Gaps into Governed Capabilities

1. **Governance Graphs**: Encode ownership, decision rights, and exceptions into a consistent authority system.
2. **Agent Orchestration**: Run agent fleets with policy-aware coordination, observability, and lifecycle management.
3. **Executable Knowledge Infrastructure**: Treat content and knowledge as executable, governed assets with provenance and auditability.
