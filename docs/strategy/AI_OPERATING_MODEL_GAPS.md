# AI-Native Operating Model Gaps (Enterprise Field Scan)

**Authority**: Summit Strategy Office
**Status**: Active execution input

## Executive Signal

AI-native enterprise operating models are emerging, yet critical gaps remain unresolved. The present landscape shows fragmented ownership, reactive governance, weak integration readiness, and stalled scale-out from pilots. Summit converts these gaps into governed, productized capabilities with explicit decision rights, policy-as-code controls, and lifecycle ownership.

---

## Gap 1: Clear Ownership and Decision Rights

**Present state**: Enterprise AI strategy, risk, and delivery ownership is fragmented across product, data, engineering, and risk. Decision rights for authorizing, overriding, or decommissioning agents are undefined.

**Summit move**: Establish explicit authority surfaces for agent ownership, decommission rights, and risk acceptance. Encode these rights into governance graphs and policy-as-code gates, and enforce them throughout the agent lifecycle.

---

## Gap 2: Embedded, Continuous Governance

**Present state**: Governance is reactive. Compliance arrives late, and most systems lack always-on control agents that log, explain, and constrain other agents in real time.

**Summit move**: Ship a control plane with policy-aware guardrails and immutable audit trails that operate from day zero. Every agent action is explained, constrained, and logged as a governed exception or compliant event.

---

## Gap 3: Integration and Data-Readiness for Agents

**Present state**: Legacy systems, missing APIs, and siloed data block agent workflows. There is no standardized “agent-ready” middleware that absorbs integration risk.

**Summit move**: Deliver a standardized integration layer that abstracts legacy complexity into governed capabilities. Integration evidence and data readiness are first-class artifacts in the execution graph.

---

## Gap 4: From Pilots to Scaled Capabilities

**Present state**: Enterprises run pilots that stall before enterprise scale because ownership and lifecycle patterns are missing. Planning methods do not align with probabilistic, experiment-heavy agent systems.

**Summit move**: Package lifecycle patterns for roadmap, budgeting, KPI ownership, and operational handoff. Every pilot is bound to a scale-out gate with explicit owners and exit criteria.

---

## Gap 5: Human Roles, Skills, and Trust Infrastructure

**Present state**: “Human above the loop” roles are described but not operationalized. Trust infrastructure is weak: audit trails, explanations, and training paths are inconsistent.

**Summit move**: Codify operator roles, training paths, and decision authority. Provide explainability, provenance, and audit artifacts that non-technical stakeholders use without interpretation.

---

## Gap 6: Standardized AI Operating-System Blueprints

**Present state**: Few organizations have an AI-specific operating model with decision rights, governance layers, and lifecycle gates. There is no widely adopted AI OS blueprint.

**Summit move**: Publish a reference “AI OS” blueprint with enforceable definitions, authority files, and lifecycle gates. This blueprint is built for adoption, adaptation, and regulated environments.

---

## Summit Differentiation: Convert Gaps into Governed Capabilities

1. **Governance Graphs**: Encode ownership, decision rights, and exceptions into a consistent authority system.
2. **Agent Orchestration**: Run agent fleets with policy-aware coordination, observability, and lifecycle management.
3. **Executable Knowledge Infrastructure**: Treat content and knowledge as executable, governed assets with provenance and auditability.
