# Customer-Led Evolution & Insights

**Agent:** Customer-Led Evolution Agent
**Mission:** Turn customer usage into directional signal.

## Signal Pipeline Strategy

We will move from reactive feedback to proactive signal detection.

### Core Signals

1.  **Adoption Velocity:** How quickly new features are integrated into daily workflows.
2.  **Abandonment Rate:** Features tried but discarded.
3.  **Emergent Workflows:** Patterns of usage that deviate from the "happy path," indicating unmet needs.

### Implementation Plan

- **Instrument:** Enhance telemetry to capture workflow contexts, not just click events.
- **Analyze:** Build dashboards to identify "Power User" clusters per vertical.
- **Rank:** Convert high-signal patterns into prioritized roadmap candidates.

## Privacy Constraints

- All analytics must be privacy-preserving.
- No raw data misuse.
- Aggregation at the tenant/team level, not individual surveillance.
