# Governance Leadership & Trust

**Agent:** Trust, Governance & Standards Leadership Agent
**Mission:** Make Summit the trusted reference architecture.

## Strategy

### 1. Standards Alignment

- **NIST AI RMF:** Align AI workflows with the Risk Management Framework.
- **C2PA:** Adopt Content Credentials for all generated intelligence.
- **Auditable Autonomy:** Lead the definition of "safe agentic" standards.

### 2. The "Open Governance" Model

- **Publish Patterns:** Share our governance models as open source/specs to set the industry standard.
- **External Advisory:** Establish a board for independent oversight of our privacy and ethics architecture.

### 3. Documentation as Artifact

- **Purpose:** Documentation must answer "Safe-to-use" as much as "How-to-use".
- **Requirement:** Every feature requires an "Audit & Compliance" section detailing data flow, retention, and access controls.
