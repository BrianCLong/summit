## Epic 5 — Customer Signal Integration (roadmap responds to reality)

1. Standardize customer feedback taxonomy (feature gaps vs bugs vs adoption friction).
2. Integrate sources: support tickets, sales notes, NPS, churn reasons, product telemetry.
3. Build a weekly “customer truth” report: top pains, top wins, top asks.
4. Create a “ticket-to-roadmap” pipeline with owners and ship dates.
5. Implement customer cohort dashboards for adoption and churn risk.
6. Use win/loss analysis to adjust roadmap priorities monthly.
7. Require customer evidence for roadmap items (no exec vibes-only adds).
8. Establish customer advisory council for strategy validation.
9. Create “commitment rules” for enterprise customers (no bespoke without plan).
10. Track impact of shipped items on customer metrics (close the loop).
11. Delete ambiguous feedback like “customers want X” without evidence.
