## Epic 3 — Portfolio Simplification & Deletion (complexity is the real enemy)

1. Inventory overlapping features, integrations, and internal platforms.
2. Select canonical implementations and publish the end-state map.
3. Create a deprecation calendar with customer comms and migration tooling.
4. Implement a quarterly “delete quota” (code, services, dashboards, vendors).
5. Track code ownership and collapse orphaned components.
6. Remove dead flags, stale configs, and unused endpoints monthly.
7. Consolidate duplicate pipelines and observability stacks (cost + toil down).
8. Standardize on a small set of frameworks/libraries (reduce cognitive load).
9. Require “delete plan” for every new system introduced (sunset path).
10. Publish “what we removed” release notes internally.
11. Delete one legacy subsystem per quarter (minimum).
