## Epic 6 — Org Design & Decision Rights (reduce coordination tax)

1. Align teams to durable domains and customer journeys (not components).
2. Define decision rights: who owns APIs, UX, pricing, platform primitives.
3. Establish escalation ladder for cross-team disputes (fast, documented).
4. Create shared platform “golden paths” with adoption targets.
5. Implement architecture review for cross-domain changes (lightweight, fast).
6. Reduce meetings via async decision docs and written updates.
7. Build a staffing plan that matches strategic bets (move people, not just priorities).
8. Train managers on execution cadence and outcome accountability.
9. Track coordination overhead (blocked time, dependency count) and reduce it.
10. Establish “two-way door” vs “one-way door” decision framework.
11. Delete committees that exist only to avoid accountability.
