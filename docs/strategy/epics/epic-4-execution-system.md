## Epic 4 — Execution System (ship outcomes, not tickets)

1. Define “definition of done” as evidence of outcome (not merged code).
2. Implement weekly outcome review: what moved, what didn’t, why.
3. Build initiative scorecards with owner, metric, risks, next actions.
4. Enforce small PRs and short cycle time standards (reduce failure rate).
5. Add release envelopes for Tier 0 changes (tests, rollback, monitoring).
6. Implement canary rollouts and auto-rollback for critical paths.
7. Maintain a blocker escalation protocol with 48-hour resolution target.
8. Run monthly “kill review” to stop low-ROI work.
9. Tie engineering capacity to reliability/error budgets (slow down if unstable).
10. Automate status reporting to reduce meeting load.
11. Delete the culture of “busy” as a proxy for progress.
