# Strategic Epics for Platform Evolution

This directory contains nine strategic epics that outline the key pillars for evolving our platform. These epics are designed to be actionable, measurable, and aligned with our long-term vision of building a defensible and customer-driven intelligence platform.

Each epic represents a core area of focus, from product strategy and governance to execution and leadership. Together, they form a comprehensive framework for achieving our strategic objectives.
