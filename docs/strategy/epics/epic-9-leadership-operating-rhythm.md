## Epic 9 — Leadership Operating Rhythm (make execution inevitable)

1. Establish weekly exec ops review: metrics, risks, decisions, commitments.
2. Maintain a top-10 enterprise risk register with ship dates.
3. Publish monthly narrative memo: what changed, why, what we’re doing.
4. Keep a decision log and revisit only when assumptions change.
5. Enforce accountability: owners, deadlines, evidence of completion.
6. Run quarterly strategy offsites with pre-reads and clear outputs.
7. Maintain a talent plan: key roles, succession, performance actions.
8. Tie incentives to outcomes: retention, reliability, margin, customer impact.
9. Run quarterly “systems review” (what systems are failing, fix them).
10. Reward deletion, simplification, and risk reduction (boring wins).
11. Institutionalize the rule: **strategy is what you say no to—repeatedly.**
