## Epic 1 — Product Strategy Compression (one narrative, fewer bets)

1. Define the single winning strategy statement (ICP + problem + why you win).
2. List all current initiatives and map each to the strategy (or mark as drift).
3. Rank initiatives by impact × confidence × time-to-value × debt reduction.
4. Pick 3 “must win” outcomes for the next 2 quarters; freeze everything else.
5. Establish kill criteria for every major bet (date + metric + owner).
6. Create a decision log for strategy calls (avoid revisiting endlessly).
7. Define what you will not build (explicit non-goals).
8. Align roadmap to core workflows (not features) with clear user journeys.
9. Tie platform work to product outcomes (no “infrastructure theater”).
10. Publish the strategy internally with simple language and examples.
11. Delete or pause 20% of roadmap immediately (make room for quality + speed).
