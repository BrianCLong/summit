## Epic 2 — Roadmap Governance & Intake (prevent re-fragmentation)

1. Create a single intake funnel for roadmap items (product, sales, support, exec).
2. Require every request to include: customer, use case, metric, evidence, alternatives.
3. Implement triage SLA and decision rights (who can say yes/no).
4. Build a quarterly planning ritual with explicit capacity allocation (feature vs debt).
5. Enforce WIP limits per team (reduce thrash).
6. Add “dependency & coupling” review for cross-team requests.
7. Maintain an exception registry for emergency roadmap adds (expiry required).
8. Publish a roadmap change log (what changed, why).
9. Add customer commitment rules (no promises without delivery capacity).
10. Track roadmap churn and reduce it quarter-over-quarter.
11. Delete shadow roadmaps in spreadsheets and decks.
