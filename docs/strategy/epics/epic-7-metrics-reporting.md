## Epic 7 — Metrics & Reporting Integrity (one truth, no spin)

1. Define the executive metric set and owners (10–15 metrics max).
2. Implement a semantic metric layer and ban local dashboard math.
3. Add leading indicators for each lagging KPI (so you can steer).
4. Build a weekly exec dashboard and monthly board-ready view.
5. Implement data quality gates for Tier 0 metrics (block bad data).
6. Create a “metric change” governance process with release notes.
7. Run monthly data integrity audits and publish results.
8. Train teams on interpreting metrics (avoid accidental self-deception).
9. Track metric disputes and eliminate root causes (definitions and pipelines).
10. Tie team OKRs to the canonical metrics (no vanity metrics).
11. Delete dashboards that aren’t used for decisions.
