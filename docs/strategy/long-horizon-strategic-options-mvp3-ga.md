# Summit 24–36 Month Strategic Options & Scenarios (MVP-3-GA)

**Purpose:** Map viable strategic options with explicit scenarios, triggers, risks, and reversibility so leadership can act decisively without overcommitment or narrative inflation.

**Scope:** 24–36 months. Options are potential paths; commitments are only made when triggers validate. MVP-3-GA is live; velocity is governed and scalable.

## B) Scenario Narratives & Signal Checklists

### S1: Regulatory Tightening Accelerates

**Environment:** New AI rules arrive faster than expected, stronger enforcement, heavier audit demands. Buyers prioritize defensibility and compliance evidence.

**Option Effects**

- **Attractive:** 1 (Governance & Trust), 5 (Efficiency)
- **Risky:** 4 (Geographic Expansion), 6 (M&A)
- **Potentially Invalid:** None, but 4/6 become costly

**Signals**

- New regulatory deadlines or enforcement actions in core markets
- Increased RFP requirements for auditability and policy-as-code
- Customer security/compliance teams gain veto power

---

### S2: Regulatory Fragmentation Increases

**Environment:** Rules diverge across jurisdictions and sectors; compliance becomes bespoke. Cross-border deployments slow.

**Option Effects**

- **Attractive:** 1 (Governance & Trust), 3 (Ecosystem)
- **Risky:** 2 (Vertical Specialization), 4 (Geographic Expansion)
- **Potentially Invalid:** 4 if compliance overhead exceeds governance capacity

**Signals**

- Divergent AI policies across regions
- Increase in multi-regulatory audit requirements per customer
- Significant expansion of compliance exception requests

---

### S3: Market Overcorrects Against AI Risk

**Environment:** Buyers and regulators impose extra caution; AI projects require more proof of safety, and non-AI alternatives are favored.

**Option Effects**

- **Attractive:** 1 (Governance & Trust), 5 (Efficiency)
- **Risky:** 3 (Ecosystem), 6 (M&A)
- **Potentially Invalid:** 3 if ecosystem demand collapses

**Signals**

- AI budgets redirected to risk mitigation vs. expansion
- Increasing demand for explainability, provenance, and non-AI fallback modes
- Declining adoption of AI-first vendor platforms

---

### S4: Capital Becomes Constrained & Buying Cycles Lengthen

**Environment:** Funding tightens and enterprise deals slow; revenue quality and efficiency dominate board priorities.

**Option Effects**

- **Attractive:** 5 (Efficiency), 1 (Governance & Trust) for retention
- **Risky:** 4 (Geographic Expansion), 6 (M&A)
- **Potentially Invalid:** 4/6 unless co-funded or revenue-backed

**Signals**

- Increased procurement cycles and security gate delays
- Larger discounts requested; spend reallocated to core vendors
- Lower renewal velocity or expansion delays

---

## C) Trigger & Decision Playbook

**Structure:** Option → Leading Indicators → Triggers → Decision Deadlines → Decision Owner(s)

### Option 1: Governance & Trust Leadership

- **Leading Indicators:** Increase in audit/assurance requirements; customer requests for policy-as-code artifacts; tighter regulator messaging
- **Triggers:** ≥30% of enterprise deals require formal assurance reports; 2+ new regulatory obligations in core markets within 12 months
- **Decision Deadline:** Next 2 quarters after trigger; delay risks losing credibility in regulated buyers
- **Owners:** Chief Risk Officer + Product Governance Lead

### Option 2: Vertical Specialization (Regulated Sectors)

- **Leading Indicators:** Repeatable demand patterns in one sector; high win rates when tailored policy packs are present
- **Triggers:** ≥3 consecutive sector wins with common compliance requirements; CAC payback improves within sector
- **Decision Deadline:** 1–2 quarters post trigger; otherwise keep as opportunistic
- **Owners:** Sector GM + Revenue Operations

### Option 3: Platform Extensibility & Ecosystem

- **Leading Indicators:** Partner pull for integrations; sustained third-party build interest; inbound connectors requested
- **Triggers:** ≥5 partners building on platform with revenue contribution; 2 major customers require ecosystem commitments
- **Decision Deadline:** 2 quarters post trigger; avoid platform sprawl without traction
- **Owners:** CTO + Partner Strategy Lead

### Option 4: Geographic/Regulatory Expansion

- **Leading Indicators:** Consistent pipeline in target jurisdiction; local regulatory clarity; channel partners available
- **Triggers:** ≥$5M qualified pipeline in new jurisdiction; clear regulatory pathway with low variance
- **Decision Deadline:** 1 quarter after trigger; if missed, deprioritize for 12 months
- **Owners:** COO + Regional GM

### Option 5: Operational Efficiency & Margin Focus

- **Leading Indicators:** Gross margin pressure; infra costs rising faster than revenue; increased board focus on cash runway
- **Triggers:** Gross margin below target for 2 consecutive quarters; runway < 24 months without growth acceleration
- **Decision Deadline:** Immediate in next quarter once trigger fires
- **Owners:** CFO + VP Engineering

### Option 6: Strategic Partnerships / Selective M&A

- **Leading Indicators:** Repeated capability gaps slowing sales; partner demand for joint offerings; acquisition targets with strong revenue signals

## D) Option Intent, Preconditions, Stop-Doing, Reversibility

### 1) Governance & Trust Leadership

- **Intent:** Establish Summit as the defensible, auditable standard for AI-augmented intel workflows.
- **Must Become True:** Policy-as-code maturity; audit evidence automation; compliance review capacity scales.
- **Stop Doing:** Experimental features without clear provenance trails; bespoke exceptions without policy encoding.
- **Reversibility:** **Medium** (investments in governance tooling are durable; exit cost moderate).

### 2) Vertical Specialization (Regulated Sectors)

- **Intent:** Win by tailoring Summit to high-value regulated sectors with repeatable compliance packs.
- **Must Become True:** Sector GTM playbooks; regulatory mappings; clear unit economics.
- **Stop Doing:** Broad, undifferentiated messaging; generalist sales motions in specialized sectors.
- **Reversibility:** **Medium** (retooling messaging and product surface is manageable).

### 3) Platform Extensibility & Ecosystem

- **Intent:** Build a partner ecosystem to expand connectors and workflows without internal overbuild.
- **Must Become True:** Stable SDKs; partner vetting; revenue-share governance.
- **Stop Doing:** High-effort custom integrations; one-off customer connectors without reuse.
- **Reversibility:** **Medium** (ecosystem obligations create ongoing support load).

### 4) Geographic/Regulatory Expansion

- **Intent:** Enter new jurisdictions with compliance-ready deployments.
- **Must Become True:** Regulatory clarity; local partnerships; compliant data residency.
- **Stop Doing:** Ad hoc market entry; shared compliance without regionalization.
- **Reversibility:** **Low** (exit costs include compliance unwind, partner obligations).

### 5) Operational Efficiency & Margin Focus

- **Intent:** Increase durability by lowering unit costs and stabilizing delivery.
- **Must Become True:** Cost observability; reliability SLO enforcement; workload prioritization discipline.
- **Stop Doing:** Low-ROI feature work; unstable experimentation without cost controls.
- **Reversibility:** **High** (efficiency gains rarely impede other options).

### 6) Strategic Partnerships / Selective M&A

- **Intent:** Acquire or partner for capabilities that reduce time-to-value.
- **Must Become True:** Clear integration plan; diligence on policy compliance and data lineage.
- **Stop Doing:** Internal builds that duplicate partner strengths; unfocused partnership proliferation.
- **Reversibility:** **Low** (integration and cultural costs are hard to unwind).

## E) Risk & Capital Interaction (Option-Level)

| Option                         | Risk Register Impact                                     | Capital Requirement | Governance Load       | Delivery System Stress    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **1. Governance & Trust**      | Lowers regulatory exposure; raises assurance obligations | Medium              | High (policy + audit) | Medium (process overhead) |
| **2. Vertical Specialization** | Sector-specific compliance risks                         | Medium              | Medium                | Medium (bespoke demands)  |
| **3. Ecosystem**               | Partner risk; integration security risk                  | Medium              | Medium                | High (partner QA)         |
| **4. Geographic Expansion**    | High regulatory/sovereignty risk                         | High                | High                  | High (localized delivery) |
| **5. Efficiency**              | Reduces operational risk; may increase change mgmt risk  | Low                 | Low                   | Low (if scoped)           |
| **6. Partnerships/M&A**        | Integration risk; culture misfit                         | High                | High                  | High                      |

**Invalid if Governance Overwhelmed:** Options 3, 4, 6 are invalid if compliance review capacity or policy-as-code coverage cannot scale proportionally. Triggers should be suppressed until governance capacity is demonstrably increased.

---

## F) Narrative & Claims Compatibility

**Narrative Guardrails**

- Every option must preserve the core narrative: **Summit is the trustworthy, auditable intelligence platform that enables governed, scalable AI-augmented workflows.**
- No option requires unproven claims; each can be communicated as **optional future paths**.

**Compatibility Summary**

- **Option 1:** Strengthens narrative without new claims.
- **Option 2:** Requires careful framing as _sector focus pilots_ unless commitment is made.
- **Option 3:** Requires claim discipline around partner governance and vetting.
- **Option 4:** Requires caution—avoid claiming jurisdictional readiness before validated.
- **Option 5:** Compatible (internal focus); minimal external narrative change.
- **Option 6:** Must emphasize _selective and bounded_ partnerships, not expansionism.

---

## G) Decision Rights & Review Cadence

**Ownership**

- **Option Evaluation Committee (OEC):** CEO (chair), CFO, COO, CRO, CTO, Head of Product Governance.
- **Scenario Steward:** Head of Strategy (or equivalent), responsible for updates and signal tracking.

**Cadence**

- **Scenario Review:** Quarterly
- **Option Activation Review:** Bi-quarterly or triggered by signals
- **Option Retirement Review:** Within one quarter of evidence that reversibility costs exceed value

**Evidence Requirements**

- Quantitative: pipeline, margin, compliance burden, time-to-close
- Qualitative: audit feedback, regulatory signals, customer risk posture
- Governance: policy-as-code coverage, audit readiness and capacity

**Documentation & Communication**

- Decisions recorded in a **Strategy Log** with triggers, evidence, and decision rationale.
- Executive brief after each review; investor-facing narrative updated **only** when option is committed.

## H) Executive Strategy Memo (Concise)

**To:** Summit Leadership

**Subject:** 24–36 Month Strategic Options for Controlled Optionality

**Summary**
Summit now has a disciplined option set across governance leadership, vertical specialization, ecosystem expansion, geographic entry, operational efficiency, and selective partnerships. None are framed as inevitable. Each has explicit triggers, reversibility considerations, and governance constraints to prevent narrative inflation and overcommitment.

**Preserved Options**

- **Governance & Trust Leadership** remains the most resilient across scenarios.
- **Operational Efficiency & Margin Focus** is the default stabilizer under uncertainty.
- **Vertical Specialization** and **Ecosystem** are conditional options activated only when traction and governance capacity are proven.
- **Geographic Expansion** and **Selective M&A** remain bounded and are **off by default** unless triggers are met and governance capacity scales.

**Why This Avoids Overcommitment**
Each option has explicit preconditions, stop-doing rules, and decision deadlines. We commit only when signals converge. Otherwise, options remain intentionally unactivated to preserve capital and narrative credibility.

**Preparedness Under Uncertainty**
Scenarios are plausible and sober. Signals and triggers prevent drift. Decision rights are clear, and governance limits are explicit. This enables leadership to say: _we are prepared for change without betraying our principles._
