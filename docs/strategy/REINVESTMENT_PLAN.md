# Reinvestment Plan

## Purpose

Ensure verified savings are explicitly redirected to roadmap initiatives without increasing platform risk.

## Allocation Table

| Savings Source              | Amount (USD) | Target Initiative     | Rationale                             | Activation Date | Owner     |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Prompt compaction + caching | 2,100        | B2 RSS/Atom Connector | Funds parser autoscaling + monitoring | 2025-01-15      | Ingestion |

## Governance

- Reinvestment proposals require approval from `governance` and the roadmap DRI.
- Activation requires guardrails green and SLA confirmation.
- If guardrails fail post-activation, revert allocation and restore prior budgets.

## Tracking

- Update alongside `docs/strategy/SAVINGS_LEDGER.md` after each sprint.
- Reflect allocations in capacity plans and Jira epics.
