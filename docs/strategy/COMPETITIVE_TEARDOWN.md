# Summit vs. Legacy Competitors: The Governance Moat

**Confidential - Internal Strategy**

## 1. The Core Differentiator
Legacy tools (Maltego, Graphika, etc.) focus on **analysis**. Summit focuses on **governed action**.
*   **They sell:** "Here is a graph of the bad guys."
*   **We sell:** "Here is a court-ready evidence chain proving coordination, with a button to disrupt it."

## 2. Feature Teardown

| Feature | Legacy Tools | Summit | Advantage |
|---------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| **Data Model** | Snapshot (Mutable) | Ledger (Immutable) | **Auditability** |
| **Attribution** | Analyst Opinion | Confidence Bands (Algorithm) | **Defensibility** |
| **Risk Model** | Content-based | Systemic (SRI) | **Regulatory Fit** |
| **Response** | None (Export PDF) | Active Measures (Agentic) | **Speed** |

## 3. Kill Points
*   **"Can you replay the investigation from 3 years ago?"** (They can't; we can).
*   **"Is this compliant with EU AI Act Article 9?"** (They aren't; we are natively).
