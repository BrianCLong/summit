## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Moat Depth

- **Metric:** "Replatforming Cost" (Estimated).
- **Signal:** How much custom logic/data does a customer build _on top_ of our graph? (Higher = deeper moat).

### 2. Ecosystem Dependency

- **Metric:** % of customer workflows that _originate_ or _terminate_ in Summit.
- **Signal:** Are we the "System of Record" (essential) or just a tool (replaceable)?

### 3. Governance Trust

- **Signal:** "Fast-tracked" status indicates high trust and brand strength.

## Risk Signals
