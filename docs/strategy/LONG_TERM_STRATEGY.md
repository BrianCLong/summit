# Long-Term Strategy: Summit Platform Evolution

**Status:** Active
**Owner:** Orchestrator (Jules Prime)
**Directive:** Customer-Led Evolution, Strategic Moats & Long-Term Dominance

## Prime Directive

Our mission is to evolve Summit into a **self-reinforcing, defensible intelligence platform**. Our advantage must compound over time through:

1.  **Customer-driven signal**
2.  **Structural technical moats**
3.  **Governance credibility**
4.  **Ecosystem lock-in without fragility**

This strategy is not about filling a roadmap with features. It is about **advantage preservation and expansion**.

## Strategic Objectives

### 1. Customer-Led Roadmap Engine

- **Goal:** Turn customer usage into directional signal.
- **Metric:** Feature adoption vs. abandonment; "power user" workflow identification.
- **Mechanism:** Privacy-preserving instrumentation; signal pipelines.

### 2. Structural Technical Moats

- **Goal:** Build capabilities that competitors cannot copy without rebuilding their entire foundation.
- **Focus:** Graph-native operations, policy-embedded computation, determinism at scale.

### 3. Institutional Trust & Governance Leadership

- **Goal:** Become the reference architecture for intelligence governance.
- **Focus:** Standards alignment, external advisory, auditability.

### 4. Long-Term Strategic Optionality

- **Goal:** Preserve future bets without immediate commitment.
- **Mechanism:** Sandboxed prototyping, clear "not now" decisions.

## Execution Guardrails

- **No roadmap driven by the loudest customer.**
- **No moats relying on secrecy alone.**
- **No lock-in that compromises trust.**
- **No strategic bets without exit criteria.**
- **No governance dilution for growth.**

## Success Criteria

- Differentiation is self-reinforcing.
- Customers act as long-term partners.
- Evolution is guided by signal, not speculation.
- Summit becomes the **institutional system of record for intelligence**.
