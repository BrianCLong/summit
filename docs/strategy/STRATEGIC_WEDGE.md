# The Summit Strategic Wedge

## Our Differentiation

Unlike competitors who focus on single vectors (workflows, portals, orchestration, or compliance), Summit wins by providing the **combination** that enterprise/regulated buyers actually require:

> **Policy-bound action + provenance receipts + multi-tenant cost attribution**

This combination applies across every workflow and connector in the platform.

## Core Narrative for Buyers

- **"AI and automation that can _actually be trusted_ in regulated/enterprise environments."**
- **"Every action is policy-checked, explainable, and exportable as evidence."**
- **"Run as Internal Platform, White-Label, or Hosted SaaS without rebuilding."**

## Competitive Positioning

| **Workflow Platforms**    | ServiceNow       | We sit underneath as the **universal policy + provenance layer**. We provide cryptographically-verifiable receipts across _every_ tool, not just ServiceNow. |
| **IDP Tools**             | Backstage, Port  | Switchboard becomes the **approval + evidence + policy gate** for actions, adding multi-tenant cost attribution and receipts to existing catalogs.           |
| **Durable Orchestration** | Temporal         | We add **trust and policy** to the durability. Our Runs UI provides run-level introspection with integrated policy traces.                                   |
| **Compliance Automation** | Vanta, Drata     | We replace manual evidence stitching with **native receipts** from every action, producing auditor-ready bundles automatically.                              |
| **Enterprise AI/Agents**  | Glean, Slack     | Our agents operate through **policy-bound tools** with allowlists and selective disclosure receipts, ensuring data privacy and control.                      |
