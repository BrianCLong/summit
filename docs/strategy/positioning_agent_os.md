# Positioning: From Workflows to Agent Operating Systems
**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Audience:** Investors, Enterprise Customers, Analysts

## The Shift
The market is pivoting from **"Chain of Thought"** (Workflow Engines) to **"State of Mind"** (Agent Runtimes).
Competitors are still building DAGs. Summit is building an OS.

## Core Pillars of the Summit Agent OS

### 1. The Runtime is the Product
We don't just "orchestrate" agents; we provide a managed runtime with:
- **Preemption:** `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `KILL` at the kernel level.
- **Isolation:** Budget and Token virtualization per process.
- **Durability:** Zero-loss state resumption via Provenance Ledger.

### 2. Predictable Autonomy (FinOps)
"Move fast and break things" is dead. "Move fast and stay under budget" is the new alpha.
- **Feature:** Pre-flight cost estimation.
- **Benefit:** CFO-friendly AI. No surprise $10k bills.
- **Evidence:** `packages/finops` demonstrates <1% variance in forecast vs. actual.

### 3. SRE for Agents (Trajectory Health)
We measure agents like services.
- **Metric:** Trajectory Health Score (0.0 - 1.0).
- **Benefit:** QA for non-deterministic software.
- **Evidence:** `packages/eval` catches oscillation loops before they burn tokens.

## The Moat
While others are optimizing prompt engineering, we are optimizing **Runtime Physics**.
We own the lifecycle, the budget, and the governance layer. They just own the text generation.
