# Strategy Brief: 12-24 Month Horizon

**To:** All Engineering, Product, GTM, and Partners
**From:** Platform Strategy Office
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Subject:** The "Governance-First" Pivot

## The Mission

Summit is evolving. We are moving from a general-purpose graph platform to a **Governance-First Cognitive Enterprise System**. Our competitive advantage is **Trust**.

In a world of black-box AI and unregulated agents, Summit provides the **Immutable Ledger** and the **Control Plane**.

## The 4 Strategic Bets

We are focusing our resources on four key areas:

1.  **Regulated Agentic Marketplace:** The "App Store" for secure, verified enterprise agents.
2.  **Continuous Assurance (CAaaS):** Compliance as a real-time data stream, not a checklist.
3.  **Cognitive Defense:** Tools to protect the enterprise from information warfare.
4.  **Auto-Scientist SDK:** Commercializing our autonomous research capabilities.

## What We Are NOT Doing

- **No Consumer Chatbots.**
- **No Ad-Tech.**
- **No Proprietary Hardware.**
- **No "Shadow IT" Tools.**

## Your Responsibility

- **Engineering:** Every feature must link to a Bet or a Moat. If it doesn't, question it.
- **Sales:** Sell the _Risk Reduction_ and _Governance_, not just the features.
- **Product:** Prioritize depth and trust over breadth and flash.

## Governance

- **PRs:** Must reference the Strategic Bet they support.
- **Roadmap:** Locked to these 4 bets. Exceptions require CEO approval.

Let's build the platform that _governs_ the future of intelligence.
