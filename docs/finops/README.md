# FinOps Operating Model

## Manifesto

We operate under the principle that **cost is a reliability problem with a price tag**. FinOps is not about "saving money" (cutting costs at the expense of value) but about "making money" (unit economics, profit by design).

## Squad

The FinOps Squad is a cross-functional team with decision rights:

- **Product Owner (Chair):** Defines value/priority.
- **Engineering Lead:** Technical feasibility and implementation.
- **SRE/Platform:** Infrastructure optimization and policy enforcement.
- **Finance Partner:** Reporting, forecasting, and budget setting.

## Cadence

- **Weekly Cost Review:** Every Monday 10:00 AM. Review top 10 cost drivers, anomalies, and forecast vs actuals.
- **Monthly Exec Readout:** 1st Friday of the month. High-level trends, unit cost evolution, and major "wins" (savings shipped).

## Responsibilities

- **Teams:** Own their cloud spend. If you provision it, you pay for it (in your budget).
- **FinOps Squad:** Provides tooling, visibility, and guardrails.
- **Finance:** Provides the bank account and high-level targets.
