# Summit Talk Abstracts - Conference Season 2026

## 1. "SRE Principles for Non-Deterministic Systems"
**Event:** SREcon 2026
**Abstract:**
Traditional monitoring (CPU, RAM) is useless for Agents. We need to measure "Trajectory Health". This talk introduces a new metric standard for autonomous systems: Convergence Time, Oscillation Rate, and Recovery Density. We'll show live production data from Summit's "Agent OS".

## 2. "Governance as Code: The Agent Charter"
**Event:** KubeCon / CloudNativeSecurity
**Abstract:**
Policy documents are write-only memory. In this talk, we demonstrate how Summit enforces "Agent Charters"—cryptographically signed authority manifests—at runtime. Watch us try to make an agent "go rogue" and see the runtime kernel kill it instantly.

## 3. "The Economics of Autonomy"
**Event:** AI Engineer Summit
**Abstract:**
Agents are expensive. We present a new architecture for "Cost-Aware Planning", where the orchestrator negotiates the budget with the planner before a single token is generated.

## 4. "Async by Default: The New Human-in-the-Loop"
**Event:** QCon
**Abstract:**
Stop blocking your agents. We propose a "Confidence-Based Escalation" model that keeps humans in the loop without destroying velocity.
