# Platform Self-Service

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the strategy for empowering developers with self-service capabilities, enabling them to efficiently manage their development environments, troubleshoot issues, and contribute to the platform's infrastructure.

## 2. Developer CLI for Ephemeral Environments

*   **Strategy**: Provide a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows developers to provision and manage ephemeral development environments on demand.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   `intelgraph env create <pr-number>`: Provisions a new ephemeral environment for a given Pull Request, complete with seeded data.
    *   `intelgraph env destroy <pr-number>`: Tears down an ephemeral environment.
    *   `intelgraph env list`: Lists active ephemeral environments.
    *   `intelgraph env connect <pr-number>`: Provides kubectl/Helm context to connect to the environment.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Leverage existing IaC (Terraform, Helm) for environment provisioning.
    *   Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to trigger environment creation/destruction.
    *   Implement data seeding mechanisms to populate environments with relevant test data.

## 3. One-Click Log/Metrics/Traces Bundle Collection

*   **Strategy**: Enable developers to easily collect diagnostic bundles (logs, metrics, traces) for specific services or requests to aid in bug reporting and troubleshooting.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   `intelgraph diagnose <service-name>`: Collects logs, metrics, and traces for a specific service.
    *   `intelgraph diagnose --request-id <id>`: Collects diagnostic data related to a specific request ID (leveraging distributed tracing).
    *   `intelgraph diagnose --time-range <start> <end>`: Collects data within a specified time range.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Integrate with observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/OpenSearch, Jaeger/Tempo) to export data.
    *   Bundle collected data into a downloadable archive.
    *   Provide a secure mechanism for sharing bundles (e.g., temporary S3 link).

## 4. Documentation and Training for Helm/Terraform Workflows

*   **Strategy**: Provide comprehensive documentation and training to enable developers to understand and contribute to Helm charts and Terraform configurations.
*   **Documentation Topics**:
    *   Helm chart structure and best practices.
    *   Terraform module development and consumption.
    *   IaC testing and validation.
    *   Deployment pipelines and GitOps workflows.
    *   Troubleshooting common infrastructure issues.
*   **Training Formats**:
    *   Workshops and hands-on labs.
    *   Internal knowledge base articles.
    *   Code examples and templates.
