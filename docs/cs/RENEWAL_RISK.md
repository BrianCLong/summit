# Renewal Risk Signals

This document outlines the model for generating renewal risk signals. The model is rule-based, ensuring that every risk assessment is transparent and directly attributable to specific, measurable factors.

## Risk Levels

The renewal risk is categorized into three levels:

- **Red:** High risk of churn. Immediate intervention is required.
- **Yellow:** Moderate risk. Proactive engagement is recommended.
- **Green:** Low risk. The customer is healthy and likely to renew.

## Risk Drivers

The primary drivers for renewal risk are derived from the customer's health score, with a particular focus on the following factors:

- **Sustained low health score:** A consistently low health score over a prolonged period is a strong indicator of risk.
- **Negative trend in health score:** A sharp decline in the health score, even if the score itself is not yet in the "red" zone, is a cause for concern.
- **High incident frequency/severity:** A high number of critical incidents can lead to customer dissatisfaction.
- **Low adoption:** Low usage of the platform is a clear sign that the customer is not realizing the full value of the product.

## Mitigation

For each identified risk, a set of recommended mitigations will be provided. These may include targeted training, proactive support, or executive-level engagement.
