# Executive Summary: Institutional Intelligence Operating Doctrine

**Status:** Directive
**Target:** Executive Leadership, Board, Stakeholders

---


## The Core Mandate

We are building **governed infrastructure**, not an experimentation platform.
The system is optimized for **durability, explainability, and trust**, not velocity.


## 1. Governance & Control
* **Policy Precedes Action:** No execution without explicit, pre-defined authorization.
* **Evidence Precedes Trust:** All claims must be backed by cryptographic or audit-trail evidence.
* **Bounded Automation:** All automated actions have hard caps, automatic rollbacks, and mandatory receipts.


## 2. Autonomy Model
Autonomy is **earned, tiered, and revocable**. It is not a default state.

* **Tier 0 (Advisory):** System recommends, Human decides.
* **Tier 1 (Human-in-Loop):** System acts only with explicit human approval per action.
* **Tier 2 (Bounded):** System acts within strict, pre-approved envelopes (e.g., +/- 5% budget).
* **Tier 3 (Strategic):** Exceptional, board-authorized, single-use actions.

**Rule:** If the system drifts or fails, autonomy is automatically revoked (demoted).


## 3. Operating Cadence
We operate on two strict cycles. "Sprints" do not exist.

1.  **Quarterly Optimization Cycle (QOC):**
    *   Focus: Making the system *better*, not *bigger*.
    *   Limit: Max 3 changes/quarter.
    *   Requirement: Must improve measurable metrics with zero regression.

2.  **Annual Re-Certification Cycle (ARC):**
    *   Focus: Re-earning the right to operate.
    *   Requirement: Every autonomy tier, certification, and budget must be re-justified.
    *   Outcome: Capabilities not re-certified are removed.


## 4. Failure & Risk
* **Drift is Failure:** Silent deviation is treated as a critical defect.
* **Contraction on Risk:** When uncertainty rises, the system automatically constricts autonomy and freezes changes.
* **Separation of Duties:** The roles of Authorizer, Operator, and Auditor are strictly separated.


## 5. Definition of Success
The platform is complete when it operates indefinitely as stable infrastructure, requiring only maintenance (QOC) and re-certification (ARC), with no pressure for "roadmap" features.

**Final Executive Assertion:**
> We do not fund "AI projects." We fund **governed capabilities** that can explain themselves, bound themselves, and be shut down safely.
