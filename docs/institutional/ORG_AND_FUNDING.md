# Organizational & Funding Model Alignment

**Status:** Draft
**Alignment:** Institutional Intelligence Operating Doctrine

---

## 1. Organizational Structure (Roles & Duties)

The organization is structured around **Separation of Duties** (Doctrine §10) to ensure checks and balances.

### 1.1 The Governing Council (Oversight)
*Accountable for the "End State" and "Annual Re-Certification (ARC)".*

*   **Platform Owner:** Strategic direction, but cannot self-approve autonomy.
*   **Chief Security Officer (CSO):** Veto power over any change. Owns "Invariants".
*   **Chief Auditor:** Independent verification of "Provenance & Receipts".

### 1.2 The Operating Core (Execution)
*Responsible for "Quarterly Optimization Cycle (QOC)".*

*   **Autonomy Approver:** Specifically certifies Tier 1-3 capabilities.
*   **System Operator:** Manages the "Tier 0" and "Tier 1" loop. Monitoring only.
*   **Optimization Engineer:** Proposes QOC changes (Max 3/quarter).

### 1.3 The Research Cell (Isolated)
*Responsible for "Research Lane".*

*   **Research Lead:** Works in strict isolation (Doctrine §8.3). No prod access.

## 2. Funding Model

Funding is **capability-based**, not feature-based. We fund **stability contracts**, not "roadmaps".

### 2.1 Base Infrastructure Grant (Keep the Lights On)
*   **Scope:** Hosting, Security, Auditing, Compliance.
*   **Metric:** 100% Uptime, 0% Drift.
*   **Review:** Annual.

### 2.2 Optimization Fund (QOC Budget)
*   **Scope:** Funding for the 3 allowed changes per quarter.
*   **Release Trigger:** Successful completion of previous QOC with receipts.
*   **Clawback:** Any regression triggers immediate funding freeze.

### 2.3 Research Stipend
*   **Scope:** Isolated experimentation.
*   **Constraint:** Zero production impact.
*   **Value:** Evaluated on "Artifacts" (Papers/Models), not features.

---

## 3. Incentive Alignment

*   **Operators** are rewarded for **uptime and silence** (lack of incidents).
*   **Engineers** are rewarded for **simplification and removal** (code deleted > code added).
*   **Approvers** are rewarded for **preventing risk** (valid rejections).

**Anti-Pattern:** Rewarding "shipping velocity" or "new features" is strictly prohibited as it violates the Doctrine.
