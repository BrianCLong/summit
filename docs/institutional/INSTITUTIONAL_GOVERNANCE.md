## 1. Mission

To position Summit as **the trusted reference system** by aligning with external audit standards, governance frameworks, and national security requirements. We establish the oversight structures that make Summit legitimate in the eyes of regulators and coalitions.

## 2. External Governance Model

### 2.1. Advisory Councils
We will establish advisory councils to provide oversight and guidance, separating technical execution from governance.
*   **Protocol Standards Council:** Oversees the evolution of the public protocols (PMP, PDI, AES). Includes external experts from academia and industry.
*   **Ethics & Safety Board:** Reviews simulation scenarios and AI safety guardrails.
*   **Sovereign User Group:** A closed forum for government and defense customers to discuss sensitive requirements.

### 2.2. Oversight Frameworks
*   **Transparency Reports:** Regular publication of system integrity metrics, vulnerability disclosures, and algorithmic impact assessments.
*   **Third-Party Audits:** Regular audits by accredited firms against SOC 2, ISO 27001, and specific sovereign standards.
*   **Algorithmic Accountability:** Mechanisms for users to query "why" a decision was made (Explainability).

## 3. Alignment Matrix

| External Framework | Alignment Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Map Summit's risk management lifecycle directly to NIST's Map/Measure/Manage/Govern functions. |
| **EU AI Act** | Ensure "High Risk" AI system compliance features (logging, human oversight, accuracy) are built-in. |
| **GDPR / CCPA** | Native support for Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR), Right to be Forgotten, and Data Portability. |
| **FedRAMP / DISA SRG** | Align architecture with controls required for FedRAMP High and IL5/IL6 authorization. |
| **Zero Trust (NIST 800-207)** | Summit acts as a Policy Decision Point (PDP) and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) within a ZT architecture. |

## 4. Public vs. Private Artifacts

To maintain trust while protecting IP, we rigorously classify artifacts:

### Public (The "Commons")
*   Protocol Specifications (PMP, PDI, AES).
*   Client SDKs and API definitions.
*   Compliance Test Suites.
*   Whitepapers on Methodology and Governance.
*   Audit Summaries.

### Controlled Access (Partners/Customers)
*   Detailed Architecture Documentation.
*   Reference Implementation Source Code (under license).
*   Full Audit Reports.
*   Advanced Configuration Guides.

### Private (The "Core")
*   Inference Engine Source Code.
*   Internal Threat Intelligence Feeds.
*   Specific Optimization Algorithms.
*   Vulnerability Details (pre-disclosure).

## 5. Controlled Publication
Whitepapers and technical reports are strategic assets. They must be:
1.  **Peer-Reviewed:** Internally and by select external advisors.
2.  **Sanitized:** Checked for sensitive IP or dual-use risks.
3.  **Timed:** Released to coincide with strategic initiatives or protocol updates.

## 6. Success Indicators
*   Summit is cited in government RFPs as a required standard.
*   Regulatory bodies accept Summit's audit logs as primary evidence.
*   Advisory council seats are sought after by industry leaders.
