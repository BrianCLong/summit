## Mission Statement

To transform Summit from a proprietary platform into a **recognized, interoperable, institution-grade system of record** by:

*   Defining what parts of Summit become **protocols**.
*   Enabling **sovereign, air-gapped, and regulated deployments**.
*   Establishing Summit as a **reference architecture** others must align to.
*   Preserving commercial advantage while standardizing the right layers.
