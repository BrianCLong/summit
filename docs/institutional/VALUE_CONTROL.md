## 1. Mission

To ensure Summit retains **irreducible commercial value** even as we standardize the underlying protocols. We must avoid the "commoditization trap" where we build the infrastructure that others profit from.

**Principle:** "Standardize the rails, not the train."

## 2. Non-Commoditizable Advantages

We will focus our proprietary development on layers that are hard to replicate, even with open protocols:

### 2.1. The Optimization Engine

- **What:** The algorithms that schedule resources, optimize graph traversals, and manage massive-scale simulations.
- **Why:** Protocols define _what_ data looks like; the engine defines _how fast_ and _efficiently_ it can be processed.
- **Moat:** Decades of accumulated heuristics and specialized solver logic.

### 2.2. The Analyst Experience (UX)

- **What:** The "Summit Console" – the visual interface for investigation, wargaming, and decision-making.
- **Why:** Protocols are for machines; the UX is for human decision-makers. A superior workflow is sticky.
- **Moat:** Deep integration of visualization, query, and action in a single pane of glass.

### 2.3. Simulation Fidelity & Content

- **What:** The specific threat models, scenario libraries, and "Digital Twin" logic.
- **Why:** The _language_ for scenarios (SimDSL) is open, but the _library_ of high-fidelity content is a premium asset.
- **Moat:** Proprietary data, research-backed psychological models, and historical event databases.

### 2.4. Governance Ergonomics

- **What:** The ease of managing complex policies across a large organization.
- **Why:** Writing OPA policy is hard; managing it at scale with a GUI, version control, and impact analysis is a product.
- **Moat:** Workflow tools that simplify compliance for non-technical officers.

## 3. Licensing Strategy

We will employ a tiered licensing model to enforce this separation:

- **Protocol License (Open):** Apache 2.0 or MIT. Allows anyone to build compatible tools. Encourages ecosystem growth.
- **Summit Core License (Commercial):** Per-node or per-user subscription. Covers the Optimization Engine, UX, and Standard Content.
- **Sovereign License (Enterprise/Gov):** Perpetual or long-term lease. Includes source code access (escrow/inspection only), air-gap support, and bespoke feature rights.
- **Certified Implementation Program:** A trademark license for partners who build compliant modules. Requires passing the test suite and paying a certification fee.

## 4. Fork Prevention & "Embrace-and-Extend" Defense

To prevent competitors from forking our protocols or using them to marginalize us:

1.  **Hard Forks are Painful:** The proprietary value layer (UX, Optimization) is tightly coupled to the _latest_ protocol version. Forking the protocol breaks the best tools.
2.  **Trademark Enforcement:** Aggressively protect the "Summit" name and "Summit Compatible" mark.
3.  **Rapid Iteration:** Innovate on the protocol layer faster than standards bodies can stagnate, but always backward compatible.
4.  **Ecosystem Gravity:** Build the best developer tools and integrations ourselves, making them the default.

## 5. Strategic Control Points

- **The Identity/Key Management Layer:** Being the root of trust makes us indispensable.
- **The Global Threat Intelligence Feed:** A live stream of data that only Summit subscribers receive.
- **The "App Store" for Models:** A marketplace where we control the distribution of third-party plugin modules.
