# Institutional Strategy & Vision: The Summit Control Plane

## 1. Executive Summary

Summit is transitioning from a proprietary platform into a **recognized, interoperable, institution-grade system of record**. This document outlines the strategic roadmap for this transformation, defining how Summit becomes critical infrastructure for sovereign, regulated, and high-security environments.

The core thesis is: **We standardize the rails, not the train.**

By defining open protocols for boundaries (provenance, policy, audit) while retaining proprietary control over the value layers (optimization, UX, simulation fidelity), Summit achieves three critical goals:

1.  **Unavoidability:** It becomes the reference architecture that others must align to.
2.  **Sovereignty:** It can be deployed in fully air-gapped and disconnected environments.
3.  **Defensibility:** It commoditizes the interfaces to secure the high-value core.

## 2. Strategic Objectives

### Objective A: Protocol Boundary Definition

**"What must be shared so Summit becomes unavoidable?"**
We will identify and standardize the interfaces that define the ecosystem. This includes the Provenance Manifest, Policy Decision Interface, and Audit Event Schema. These will be released as vendor-neutral specifications.

### Objective B: Sovereign & Air-Gapped Deployments

**"Summit runs where clouds cannot."**
We will engineer Summit to function with full fidelity in disconnected, classified, and sovereign environments. This requires deterministic builds, offline key management, and hardware-backed trust anchors.

### Objective C: Institutional Trust & External Alignment

**"Regulators, governments, and coalitions recognize this as the reference."**
We will align Summit's governance with international standards and establish advisory councils to oversee the protocol layers, ensuring long-term legitimacy and trust.

### Objective D: Control of the Value Layer

**"We standardize the rails, not the train."**
We will rigorously protect the proprietary intellectual property that drives commercial value: the inference engines, the simulation fidelity, the advanced UX, and the governance ergonomics.

## 3. The 5-10 Year Vision: The Summit Control Plane

### Phase 1: The Reference Implementation (Years 1-2)

- **Action:** Publish RFC-style specifications for core protocols.
- **Goal:** Establish Summit as the functional reference for cognitive infrastructure.
- **Milestone:** First external implementation of a Summit Protocol.

### Phase 2: The Sovereign Standard (Years 3-5)

- **Action:** Deploy validated air-gapped instances in multiple sovereign jurisdictions.
- **Goal:** Become the default operating system for national-scale cognitive security.
- **Milestone:** Summit adopted by a G7 nation or major coalition as a standard.

### Phase 3: The Universal Control Plane (Years 6-10)

- **Action:** Federation of sovereign instances via trusted bridges.
- **Goal:** A global, decentralized, yet standardized mesh of cognitive security nodes.
- **Milestone:** "Summit Compatible" becomes a procurement requirement for global institutions.

## 4. Agent Dispatch & Governance

This strategy is executed by a federated team of agents:

- **Protocol Agent:** Defines the open standards.
- **Sovereign Agent:** Ensures offline/classified operability.
- **Governance Agent:** Manages institutional trust and alignment.
- **Value Agent:** Protects commercial leverage.
- **Risk Agent:** Mitigates fork and misuse risks.

## 5. Success Criteria

- ✅ Clear protocol boundaries defined and documented.
- ✅ Summit runs fully air-gapped and sovereign.
- ✅ External bodies recognize Summit patterns as reference.
- ✅ Commercial value remains defensible.
- ✅ Fork and misuse risks are bounded.
- ✅ Summit is seen as infrastructure, not a tool.
