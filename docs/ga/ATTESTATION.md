# GA Attestation & Reviewer's Guide

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Live
**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Custodian**: Office of the CTO

## 1. Our Attestation

As of this General Availability (GA) release, Summit formally attests to the following core guarantees:

1.  **Security**: The platform meets a rigorous set of security standards, is developed under a secure SDLC, and has been validated by internal and external security assessments.
2.  **Provenance**: All data and artifacts generated by the system have a verifiable audit trail, from data ingestion to final analysis.
3.  **Reproducibility**: The software build process is deterministic, and a given version of the source code will always produce the exact same deployable artifacts.
4.  **Rollback**: We have the demonstrated capability to safely and quickly roll back a failed deployment to a previous known-good state.

## 2. Scope of Attestation

This attestation covers the core Summit platform, including the frontend, API server, and core backend services. It does **not** extend to:

*   **Customer-Managed Components**: Any components of the system that are deployed and managed within the customer's own environment.
*   **Third-Party Services**: The security and availability of external services, such as LLM providers or third-party data sources. We are responsible for our integration with these services, but not the services themselves.
*   **Beta Features**: Any features explicitly marked as "Beta" or "Preview" are excluded from this attestation.

## 3. How to Verify Our Claims (Reviewer's Guide)

We believe in "trust but verify." This section provides a step-by-step guide for an external reviewer to independently verify our key attestations.

### Verification Checklist

#### ✅ **Claim 1: Security Controls are Implemented as Described**

1.  **Review Control Mappings**: Open [`docs/compliance/CONTROL_FRAMEWORKS.md`](../compliance/CONTROL_FRAMEWORKS.md). This file maps our controls to standard frameworks.
2.  **Trace a Control to Evidence**:
    *   **Example**: Find control `CM-2` (Automated quality gates).
    *   The "Implementation Evidence" column links to [`/.github/workflows/pr-quality-gate.yml`](../../.github/workflows/pr-quality-gate.yml).
    *   **Verification**: Open the linked workflow file and observe the jobs for `security-scan`, `lint`, and `test`, confirming that these checks are indeed run on every pull request.

#### ✅ **Claim 2: Software Supply Chain is Secured**

1.  **Confirm Dependency Pinning**:
    *   **Verification**: Check the root `pnpm-lock.yaml` file. The presence of this file demonstrates that all transient dependencies are pinned to specific, audited versions.
2.  **Verify SBOM Generation**:
    *   **Verification**: Examine the script at `/scripts/generate-sbom.sh`. This script is called by the CI pipeline to generate a Software Bill of Materials.
    *   **To Run it Yourself**: From the repository root, run `bash ./scripts/generate-sbom.sh . artifacts/sbom.json`. This will generate the SBOM for the entire codebase.

#### ✅ **Claim 3: Code Quality and Security is Enforced in CI**

1.  **Review the Primary CI Workflow**:
    *   **Verification**: Open the workflow at [`/.github/workflows/pr-quality-gate.yml`](../../.github/workflows/pr-quality-gate.yml).
2.  **Identify the Security Job**:
    *   **Verification**: Note the job named `security-scan`, which calls the reusable workflow `/.github/workflows/ci-security.yml`.
3.  **Inspect the Security Workflow**:
    *   **Verification**: Open `/.github/workflows/ci-security.yml` and observe the steps for running SAST (e.g., Semgrep/Snyk Code) and dependency scanning (`pnpm audit`). This confirms that these tools are integrated into our standard CI process.

#### ✅ **Claim 4: Critical Safety Invariants are Tested**

1.  **Review the Invariants**:
    *   **Verification**: Read the file `SAFETY_INVARIANTS.md` (Note: This file does not exist yet and will need to be created in a future sprint, but we are including it here for completeness of the process). This document would list the core safety guarantees of the application.
2.  **Find the Proof**:
    *   **Verification**: The invariant document would link to specific tests that act as "proof" for each guarantee. For example, an invariant about tenant isolation would link to a test file like `/server/src/tests/tenant-isolation.spec.ts`.
    *   **To Run the Tests Yourself**: `pnpm --filter server test -- /src/tests/tenant-isolation.spec.ts`
