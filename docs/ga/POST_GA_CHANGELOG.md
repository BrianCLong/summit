### Stabilization Fixes

*   **ID:** `W1-P1-001`
*   **Change:** Created placeholder document templates for `WEEK0_SIGNAL_MONITORING.md` and `GA_FEEDBACK_INTAKE.md`.
*   **Reason:** Addressed a process gap where the mandated post-GA stabilization process lacked its required input documents. This change establishes the correct framework for future releases.
*   **Impact:** No impact on GA claims or system functionality. This is a documentation-only change to improve process hygiene.
*   **Type:** `post-GA stabilization`
