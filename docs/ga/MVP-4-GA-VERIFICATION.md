# MVP-4 → GA Verification Matrix

This sweep captures the minimum credible verification for the GA-hardening surfaces. Each item is tied to a deterministic artifact and CI hook so reviewers can trace evidence without depending on unstable runners.

| Feature                          | Verification Artifact                                                                                                       | Tier | CI / Command              | Notes                                                                                                         |

| Observability Taxonomy           | `testing/ga-verification/ga-features.ga.test.mjs` (checks METRICS/LOGS/EVENTS taxonomy files)                               | B    | `make ga-verify`          | Keeps telemetry conventions stable without requiring Jest.                                                    |
| Data Classification & Governance | `testing/ga-verification/ga-features.ga.test.mjs` (ensures governance reference file is present)                            | B    | `make ga-verify`          | Guards the authoritative governance doc.                                                                      |

| Governance Verdict Gate          | `.github/workflows/governance-verdict.yml` + `scripts/ci/collect_inputs.mjs` (outputs `governance_verdict.json`)            | B    | `GovernanceVerdict`       | Enforces policy-as-code verdicts with evidence IDs and normalized input hashes.                               |
| Ingestion Security Hardening     | `testing/ga-verification/ga-features.ga.test.mjs` (checks ingestion hardening evidence)                                     | B    | `make ga-verify`          | Ensures security expectations remain documented and discoverable.                                             |
| Generative UI Plan Contract      | `docs/ga/genui/UI_CONTRACT.md` (contract, tool manual, anti-footguns evidence)                                              | C    | `make ga-verify`          | Confirms the GenUI plan contract, tool schema, and safety guardrails are anchored in GA docs.                 |
| GA Gate Artifact Closure         | `docs/ga/MVP4_GA_GATE_ARTIFACTS.md` (gate artifact closure runbook + evidence map)                                          | C    | `make ga-verify`          | Forces closure of Terraform/DR/Canary/Migrations gate artifacts before GA readiness changes.                  |
| Media Authenticity & Provenance  | `scripts/ci/verify_media_provenance.ts` + `docs/governance/media_provenance.md`                                             | B    | `make ga-verify`          | Blocks marketing/public media changes without deterministic provenance evidence.                              |

## Deferred / To-Improve Items

- Promote Tier B checks to Tier A Jest suites once the runner stabilizes.
- Expand schema validation to cover runtime policies (OPA/Rego) when they are landed in-tree.
- Attach evidence artifacts (logs, receipts) to CI once provenance plumbing is fully wired.
