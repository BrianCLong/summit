**Authority:** Jules (Post-GA Stabilization Captain)

## 1. The Immutable Lock
This baseline represents the **exact state** of the Summit Platform as shipped for MVP-4 GA. Any deviation from the artifacts listed below is considered **drift** and must be remediated or explicitly authorized via the V2 Governance Override process.

## 2. Canonical Documentation Artifacts
The following files define the "Truth" of this release. Their content at the commit hash above is the binding contract.

*   `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md` (The "What")
*   `docs/releases/MVP-4_GA_BASELINE.md` (The "Checklist")
*   `docs/releases/MVP-4_POST_GA_STABILIZATION_PLAN.md` (The "Now What")
*   `package.json` (The "Version": 4.1.0-rc.1)

## 3. Drift Policy
*   **Code:** No functional changes allowed without a corresponding stabilization ticket.
*   **Docs:** Clarifications allowed; policy changes require V2 Governance review.
*   **Infrastructure:** No unrecorded configuration changes.

> "This baseline represents GA as shipped."
