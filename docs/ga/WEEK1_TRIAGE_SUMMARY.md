# Week-1 Triage Summary

This document summarizes the triage of signals observed during the first week post-GA.

## 1. Signals Observed

| Signal Source | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/ga/WEEK0_SIGNAL_MONITORING.md` | **UNKNOWN** | File not found. |
| `docs/ga/GA_FEEDBACK_INTAKE.md` | **UNKNOWN** | File not found. |

## 2. Incidents or Near-Misses

*   **Near-Miss:** The mandated process for Week-1 stabilization relies on input files that were not created as part of the GA process. This represents a procedural near-miss, as it prevents the direct measurement of system health and feedback.

## 3. Root Cause Classification

*   **Root Cause:** Documentation Gap.
*   **Description:** The GA checklist and readiness procedures did not include the creation and handoff of the signal monitoring and feedback intake documents required for post-GA stabilization.
*   **Follow-up:** A P1 issue will be created to establish these documents immediately.
