# GA Announcement Execution Checklist

**Goal:** Ensure the GA announcement is accurate, traceable, and free of liability-inducing promises.

## 1. Baseline Verification

- [ ] **Readiness Assertion Confirmed**: Verify `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md` is "FINAL".
- [ ] **Master Checklist Green**: Verify `docs/ga/MVP4-GA-MASTER-CHECKLIST.md` shows ≥95% readiness.
- [ ] **Artifact Alignment**: Ensure `docs/ga/customer-launch-announcement.md` matches certified capabilities only.

## 2. Claim Verification (The "Do Not Claim" List)

Strictly **FORBIDDEN** claims (per `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md`):

- [ ] **NO "Autonomous Agents"**: Must be described as "Human-in-the-Loop" or "Analyst Assist".
- [ ] **NO "Active Defense"**: PsyOps module is "Passive/Analysis" only.
- [ ] **NO "Predictive Geopolitics"**: Oracle is "Calibration/Simulation" only.
- [ ] **NO "Zero Defects"**: Claim "Managed Resilience" or "SLO-backed", not bug-free.
- [ ] **NO Roadmap Dates**: Do not promise specific dates for V2 features.

## 3. Canonical References

Ensure all external links point *only* to these finalized artifacts:

- [ ] **Architecture**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (v2.0)
- [ ] **Governance**: `docs/GOVERNANCE-DESIGN.md` (v2.0)
- [ ] **Security**: `docs/ga/SECURITY_BASELINE.md` (if exists) or `docs/security/SECURITY_BASELINE.md`
- [ ] **SLOs**: `docs/performance/SLOS.md` or `docs/ga/OBSERVABILITY.md`

## 4. Final Polish

- [ ] **Tone Check**: Operational, professional, sober. (No "excited to announce", use "Summit is now GA").
- [ ] **Consistency**: "IntelGraph" vs "Summit" usage matches branding guide.
- [ ] **Date Check**: Release date matches signed-off execution date.

## 5. Execution

- [ ] **Internal Comms**: Sent to Engineering/Product (T-24h).
- [ ] **External Pub**: Published to Customer Portal (T-0).
- [ ] **Status Page**: Updated to "Operational" (T-0).
