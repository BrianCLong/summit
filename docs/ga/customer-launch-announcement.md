We’re launching IntelGraph GA with a focus on trustable analysis and operational reliability.

What’s new
- Provenance‑first exports: every disclosure includes verifiable manifests.
- Policy isolation: multi‑tenant guardrails with explicit denials and appeal paths.
- Offline case sync: resilient field work with signed resync logs.

What this means for you
- Evidence you can verify; exports respect licenses and terms.
- Faster answers with measured reliability; clear SLOs and change notes.

Security & Compliance
- Images are signed; SBOMs are published. Our export guard blocks restricted content with a human‑readable reason and owner reference.

Availability & Rollout
- Gradual rollout with canarying; no downtime expected. Your account team will share timeline specifics.

Questions
Contact your IntelGraph representative for details on manifests, validation sets, and rollout windows.
