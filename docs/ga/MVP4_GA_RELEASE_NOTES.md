# MVP4 GA RELEASE NOTES

**Release Notes Date:** 2026-01-12
**Authority:** Summit Readiness Assertion (docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md)

## Release Notes

Summit MVP4 GA release readiness is anchored to the published baseline and the evidence map. This
release emphasizes verifiable controls, deterministic gates, and aligned governance artifacts.

## Scope Highlights

- Evidence map and security ledger are authoritative and machine-verified.
- Trust dashboard consolidates hard-gate status with commit and timestamp.

## Constraints

- No GA claim is valid without a `paths`, `verify`, and `indicator` entry in the evidence map.
- Open high/critical security items block GA promotion.
