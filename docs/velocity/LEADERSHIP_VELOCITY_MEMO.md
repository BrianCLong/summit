# Leadership Velocity Memo

**Purpose:** Set clear delivery expectations for Summit sprints based on the capacity model
(see `docs/CAPACITY_PLANNING.md` and velocity plans).

## What Summit can reliably deliver per sprint

- A committed, capacity-backed increment of prioritized scope aligned to the sprint goal.
- A stable, test-backed release candidate that meets the golden-path standard.
- Clear acceptance evidence for the committed increment (demo, release notes, and status
  updates tied to the capacity model).

## What Summit intentionally does **not** promise

- Open-ended or speculative scope outside the committed sprint goal.
- Cross-zone changes that violate boundary rules or lack explicit coordination.
- Delivery dates for work not sized, staffed, or accepted into the capacity model.
- Exceptions that bypass quality gates, security requirements, or governance policy-as-code.

## Why this model protects trust, quality, and execution integrity

- **Trust:** Commitments are grounded in demonstrated capacity and are consistently met.
- **Quality:** Every deliverable respects golden-path tests and policy-as-code guardrails.
- **Integrity:** Scope changes are explicit, logged, and governed—no silent trade-offs.
