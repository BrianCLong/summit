# Leadership Velocity Memo

## What Summit Can Reliably Deliver

- Delivery velocity is now modeled using a shared **engineer-week + review-hour**
  capacity system.
- Fixed reservations protect GA stability, graduation, and governance work before any
  discretionary scope is planned.
- Commitments are capacity-constrained, lane-bound, and WIP-limited, ensuring realistic
  delivery without burnout.

## What Summit Does Not Promise

- We do **not** promise delivery beyond documented capacity or outside WIP limits.
- We do **not** absorb governance or graduation work “for free.”
- We do **not** trade GA stability for experimental acceleration.

## Why This Protects Trust and Quality

- Velocity is now explicit, auditable, and resistant to optimism bias.
- Review and governance work are first-class capacity items, not hidden overhead.
- The model prevents silent risk accumulation and preserves sustainable execution.

## Bottom Line

We know how fast we can go—and why. This protects trust, quality, and long-term delivery
capacity while keeping Summit’s commitments credible under scrutiny.
