## Actions for Engineering Leads

1. Reference the DP budget allocation disclosure in privacy reviews for federated query changes; cite the tier weights, renewal cadences, and Merkle-rooted ledgering.
2. Link the offline mirror orchestration disclosure in deployment and supply-chain runbooks for air-gapped customers.
3. Record references in the architecture decision log and sprint briefs to ensure traceability.

## Actions for Legal

1. Capture both disclosures in the patent evidence docket; note timestamps and repository commit hash.
2. File an external defensive publication (IP.com or equivalent) if required by policy; reuse filenames and timestamps to lock priority.
3. Add citations to any claim drafting packages that touch DP enforcement or offline mirroring/rollback controls.

## Delivery Tracking

- Create tickets: `ENG-DEF-PUB-DP-BUDGET` and `ENG-DEF-PUB-OFFLINE-MIRROR` with links to the above files.
- Notify mailing lists: `engineering-leads@` and `legal@` with commit hash and file paths.
- If external venue submission occurs, attach the receipt/DOI to the tickets and mirror in `docs/defensive-pubs/receipts/`.
