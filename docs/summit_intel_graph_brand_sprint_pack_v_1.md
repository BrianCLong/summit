# Summit IntelGraph — Brand Sprint Pack (v1)

**North Star**  
*The view from above the clouds — where we can finally sum it up, see the whole, and decide with confidence.*

---

## 1) Naming & Architecture

**Master brand:** **Summit**  
**Product family:** **Summit IntelGraph** (flagship platform)  
**Sub‑brands (examples):** Apex (analytics), Vista (UI tri‑pane), Ledger (provenance), Strata (ingest/ETL), Traverse (COA/simulation), Beacon (alerts), Ombra (governance & audit), Ridge (collab/case spaces).

**Why “Summit”:** evokes altitude, clarity, and achievement; plays naturally with “sum it.”  
**Why keep “IntelGraph”:** preserves equity and immediate meaning for core buyers; reads as the flagship product under Summit.

**Brand architecture options**
1. **Endorsed:** *Summit* ⟶ **IntelGraph** (endorsed by Summit).  
2. **Masterbrand:** **Summit IntelGraph** (compound name used everywhere).  
3. **House of products:** **Summit** (company) + **IntelGraph** (product) + modules (Apex, Vista…).

*Recommendation:* Start **Masterbrand** for 6–12 months (“Summit IntelGraph”), then taper to **Endorsed** as awareness grows.

## 3) Positioning & Pillars

**Positioning (one‑liner)**  
**Summit IntelGraph** is the analyst‑first intelligence graph platform that unifies ingestion, provenance, analytics, and audit so teams can see patterns sooner and act with confidence.

**Value pillars**
1) **Altitude** — See the whole terrain: timeline × map × graph.
2) **Integrity** — Every claim traced and auditable.
3) **Velocity** — From ingest to insight, fast.
4) **Control** — Compartmentation, governance, and ethics by design.

**Proof points (short)**  
- Unified graph + provenance ledger.  
- Tri‑pane “Vista” experience for full‑picture sense‑making.  
- Guardrails & audit for trust at scale.

---

## 4) Voice & Tone

**Voice:** clear, grounded, confident.  
**Tone sliders:** Analytical ▶ Human. Principled ▶ Pragmatic. Calm ▶ Urgent (when appropriate).  
**Do say:** clarity, evidence, altitude, confidence, integrity.  
**Avoid:** hype, fearmongering, militarized metaphors.

**Microcopy examples**
- Empty state: *“No clouds here yet. Connect a source to start summiting.”*  
- Export banner: *“Evidence sealed. Hash manifest ready.”*

---

## 5) Visual Identity (directions)

**Logo concepts**
- **Σ‑Peak:** Integrate a subtle sigma (∑) into a minimalist peak glyph.  
- **Isoline Peak:** Topographic lines forming a summit; negative‑space cloud halo.  
- **Node‑to‑Peak:** Three linked nodes resolving into a peak tip — “sum → summit.”

**Mark/Wordmark lockups**  
- Primary: **Summit** (bold) + **IntelGraph** (light) stacked; peak glyph left.  
- Secondary: horizontal lockup; small‑space monogram “Σ▲”.

**Color system (Altitude Palette)**
- **Peak Slate** `#0E1217` (primary text/UI)  
- **Stratus Gray** `#1F2A33` (surfaces)  
- **Aurora Blue** `#2E7AE5` (actions/links)  
- **Glacier White** `#F4F7FA` (backgrounds)  
- **Ember** `#E66A2E` (accent/alerts)  
- **Moss** `#2EAD73` (success)

**Typography (open‑source)**
- **Headings:** Space Grotesk (alt: Inter)  
- **Body/UI:** Inter  
- **Monospace:** IBM Plex Mono  

**Graphic language**
- Thin contour lines, altitude bands, and light grain gradients.  
- Subtle parallax clouds in hero scenes; never cheesy or literal.  
- Graph paths glow as they “converge” to a peak.

**Motion**  
- Ease‑in “ascend” on load; focus/defocus like clouds parting.  
- Avoid swoopy camera moves; privilege calm confidence.

---

## 6) Product & Feature Naming (examples)

- **Summit IntelGraph** — the platform.  
- **Strata** — ingestion & ETL.  
- **Ledger** — provenance & claim registry.  
- **Vista** — tri‑pane (graph/map/timeline).  
- **Apex** — analytics suite (paths, communities, risk).  
- **Traverse** — COA planner & simulations.  
- **Beacon** — watchlists & alerts.  
- **Ombra** — governance, audit, policy reasoner.  
- **Expedition Kit** — offline/edge mode.  

*Guidelines:* keep terrain/altitude metaphors; 1‑word, two‑syllable if possible; avoid duplication with competitors.

## 7) Messaging Blocks (ready‑to‑ship)

**Website hero**  
*Summit IntelGraph*  
**The view from above the clouds.**  
Unify data, prove claims, and see patterns sooner — so you can decide with confidence.  
[Get a demo] [See how it works]

**10‑second pitch**  
We give analysts the altitude and integrity to see the whole picture — fast.

**30‑second pitch**  
Summit IntelGraph unifies ingestion, provenance, and graph analytics into a single analyst‑first workspace. From timeline to map to graph, you get the view from above the clouds, complete with audit‑ready evidence so decisions are fast and defensible.

**1‑paragraph boilerplate**  
Summit is a design‑led intelligence company. Our flagship, **Summit IntelGraph**, brings together data intake, graph analytics, and a provenance ledger inside a governed, collaborative workspace. Teams use Summit to “sum it up” — to surface patterns, test hypotheses, and publish audit‑ready briefs with confidence.

**Customer email (template)**
Subject: *Introducing Summit — same team, higher clarity*

Hello — Today we’re reintroducing ourselves as **Summit** and our flagship platform as **Summit IntelGraph**. The name reflects what you’ve told us you value most: the view from above the clouds, and the ability to *sum it up* with evidence. Your contracts, data, and roadmap remain unchanged. New visuals will roll out over the next two weeks. Questions? We’re here.  
— The Summit team

## 10) Quick Creative Brief (for design team)

**Objective:** Build a refined wordmark + peak glyph with sigma integration; craft hero visuals featuring altitude bands and a resolving graph.  
**Audience:** Analysts, investigators, DFIR/CTI leads, policy advisors.  
**Deliverables:** Logo suite, color tokens, type scale, 4 hero illustrations, slide master, social kit, web hero section.  
**Tone words:** Clear, principled, elevated, precise, calm.  
**Don’ts:** No sci‑fi grids, no fear imagery, no combat visuals, no glossy chrome.

## 12) Next Steps

1) Choose architecture (Masterbrand vs Endorsed).  
2) Shortlist and test 2–3 taglines with customers.  
3) Commission logo explorations on **Σ‑Peak** and **Isoline Peak**.  
4) Update UI tokens and website hero with Altitude Palette.  
5) Prep the two‑week rollout using the Launch Kit.
