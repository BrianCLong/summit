# Doctrine Lock

**Status:** IMMUTABLE
**Authority:** DOCTRINE-ROOT
**Last Verified:** 2025-10-25

## The Lock
This directory (`docs/doctrine/`) represents the semantic kernel of the Summit platform. It is designed to be **immutable** in spirit and **highly resistant** to change in practice.

These documents are not:
*   Living documents (in the agile sense)
*   Drafts
*   Suggestions
*   Marketing copy

They are:
*   **Constitutional:** They define the laws the system must obey.
*   **Invariants:** They define what does not change when everything else does.

## Checksum Concept
Think of this directory as a "Semantic Checksum" for the organization. If the behavior of the software, the culture of the team, or the claims of the marketing department diverge from these documents, the checksum has failed.

**Corrective Action:** Align the reality to the doctrine, not the doctrine to the reality.

## The Cost of Change
Changing these documents should be:
*   Painful
*   Slow
*   Public
*   Rare

If you find yourself needing to change them frequently, you are likely drifting. Stop.

## Integration
This doctrine is referenced by:
1.  **Governance:** Compliance frameworks derive from the *Roles and Responsibilities*.
2.  **Engineering:** System architecture must respect the *Refusal Surface*.
3.  **Product:** Features must adhere to *Claim Discipline*.
4.  **Narrative:** All communication must use the *Canonical Lexicon*.

## Final Word
Everything outside this directory is execution. This is definition.
**Protect the definition.**
