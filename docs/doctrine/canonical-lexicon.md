## Purpose
To prevent semantic drift and anthropomorphism, the following terms are "locked." Their definitions in this document are the only valid definitions within the Summit ecosystem.

## 1. Core Entities

### Summit
**Definition:** The integrated platform comprising the Knowledge Lattice, Maestro Orchestrator, and associated agents.
**Forbidden Usage:** Referring to Summit as "He/She" or attributing sentient agency (e.g., "Summit *wants* to..."). Summit is a tool.

### Agent
**Definition:** A software process capable of autonomous task execution within a defined scope.
**Constraint:** Agents are "Probabilistic Functions," not "Digital Employees."

### Operator
**Definition:** The authenticated human user responsible for directing the system and accepting liability for its outputs.

## 2. Operational States

### Provenance
**Definition:** The unbroken, cryptographic or logical chain of custody for a piece of data or a decision.
**Requirement:** Data without provenance is "Noise," not "Intelligence."

### Hallucination
**Definition:** The generation of false or unsupported claims by a generative model.
**Preferred Term:** "Fabrication" or "Model Failure."

### Uncertainty
**Definition:** The statistical confidence interval surrounding a prediction or analysis.
**Requirement:** Uncertainty is a data point, not a bug. It must be displayed, not hidden.

---

## 3. Action Verbs

### Recommend
**Definition:** The system proposes a course of action based on evidence.
**Context:** Summit *recommends*; the Operator *decides*.

### Execute
**Definition:** The system carries out a specific, authorized instruction.

### Refuse
**Definition:** The system declines to execute an instruction due to a policy violation or invariant breach.
**Context:** Refusal is an active safety state, not a passive error.

## 4. Narrative & Cognitive Terms

### Narrative Invariant
**Definition:** A core truth about the system that cannot be violated without corrupting the system's purpose.

### Semantic Drift
**Definition:** The gradual change in the meaning of system terms or purpose over time, leading to misalignment and failure.
**Context:** The enemy of stability.

### Claim Discipline
**Definition:** The rigorous practice of ensuring every system assertion is backed by verifiable evidence.
