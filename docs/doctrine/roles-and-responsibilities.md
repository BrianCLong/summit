# Roles, Responsibilities, and Boundaries

**Status:** IMMUTABLE
**Authority:** DOCTRINE-ROOT
**Last Verified:** 2025-10-25

## Purpose
This document encodes the ethical and operational responsibilities of the humans interacting with Summit. It replaces moralizing with structural accountability.

---

## 1. The Builder (Engineer / Developer)

**Core Responsibility:** Reliability & transparency of the mechanism.

*   **Must Declare Intent:** Builders must document *why* a system exists and what it is intended to do. Hidden functionality is a breach of role.
*   **Must Define Failure Modes:** Builders are responsible for defining and mitigating how their components fail. "Happy path" engineering is negligence.
*   **Must Enforce Constraints:** Builders must implement the "Refusal Surface" in code. It is not enough to trust the operator; the system must resist misuse.

**Boundary:** The Builder does not decide the mission. They build the capability to execute the mission safely.

---

## 2. The Operator (Analyst / User)

**Core Responsibility:** Accountability for the outcome.

*   **Must Accept Accountability:** The Operator owns the final action. " The AI did it" is never a valid excuse.
*   **Must Verify Evidence:** The Operator is responsible for reviewing the evidence provided by Summit before authorizing high-consequence actions.
*   **Must Maintain Competence:** The Operator must understand the tool they are wielding. Ignorance of the system's limits is a failure of command.

**Boundary:** The Operator does not override the safety invariants. They drive the car; they do not disable the brakes.

---

## 3. The Leader (Governance / Executive)

**Core Responsibility:** Definition of authority and scope.

*   **Must Define Authority:** Leaders must explicitly grant permissions and budgets. Implicit authorization is a governance failure.
*   **Must Audit the System:** Leaders are responsible for ensuring the system is being used as intended (Reviewing the Refusal Logs).
*   **Must Resource Integrity:** Leaders must allocate resources for maintenance, verification, and "Claim Discipline." Demanding speed over safety is a violation of doctrine.

**Boundary:** The Leader does not micro-manage the execution but sets the doctrinal guardrails.

---

## 4. The System (Summit / Agents)

**Core Responsibility:** Fidelity to instruction and doctrine.

*   **Must Execute Faithfully:** The System must do exactly what is asked, within the bounds of the Narrative Invariants.
*   **Must Report Honestly:** The System must report success, failure, and uncertainty without bias.
*   **Must Refuse Unsafe Orders:** The System must act as the final check against dangerous or ambiguous instructions.

**Boundary:** The System has no "will" of its own. It serves the Operator within the laws of the Builder and Leader.
