DOCTRINE_LOCKED = true

# Purpose Lock

This document freezes the shared understanding of the counter-intelligence and information sovereignty stack. It articulates why the stack exists, who it serves, and the non-negotiable outcomes it must deliver.

## Purpose

- Protect decision integrity by ensuring every critical decision carries evidence, confidence bounds, and authority provenance.
- Guard the information supply chain so expired, unattributed, or revoked facts never influence outcomes.
- Preserve explicit refusal rights so the system can fail closed when requirements are not met.

## Scope

- Applies to all governance, runtime enforcement, and CI gates described in the doctrine spine.
- All new policies, controls, or CI checks must trace back to a section in this directory before implementation.

## Guardrails

- Doctrine is authoritative; implementation work must not redefine intent.
- Changes to this document require the amendment process outlined in `amendment-process.md`.

## Success Criteria

- Decision pathways cannot execute without admissible evidence and declared authority.
- Drift between doctrine and code/CI is detectable via automated checks.
- Refusal pathways remain available and evidence-generating at all times.
