# Executive Summary

**Verdict:** Strong platform foundations with ambitious scope and lots of good hygiene (Helm/Terraform, runbooks, OTEL/Prometheus, preview envs, Dependabot, release-please). The biggest risks are **CI sprawl & flakiness**, **inconsistent security enforcement (placeholders, committed .env in repo)**, and **incomplete promotion gates**. Streamlining CI, enforcing deployment gates, and tightening secrets/IaC posture will materially increase safety and velocity.

**Maturity snapshot (A–F):**
- **Repo hygiene & docs:** A-
- **CI/CD pipeline quality:** B- (sprawl, flakiness, placeholders)
- **Progressive delivery & rollback:** B (present but not uniformly enforced)
- **Observability & SLOs:** B+ (OTEL + Prometheus + dashboards; needs SLO burn integration & alerts hardening)
- **Security/Compliance:** B (good scaffolding: gitleaks, SBOM, cosign; needs CodeQL/Semgrep, SLSA provenance & mandatory gates)
- **IaC (Helm/Terraform/K8s):** B (good coverage; secrets & state need hardening; drift detection missing)
- **Testing (unit/e2e/load/contract):** B (breadth present; signal-to-noise & determinism need work)
- **Release mgt (train, notes, versioning):** B+ (release-please present; canary plans in runbooks)
- **DR/BCP:** B- (runbooks exist; needs scheduled drills + automated restore verification)

# Key Findings (what’s great)

1) **Infra-as-Code everywhere**: Helm charts per service, Terraform modules (Aurora, env folders), K8s manifests with preview namespaces; PR previews via workflow.
2) **Observability-first**: OTEL collector config, Prometheus targets, Grafana dashboards (golden signals present), metrics in server code.
3) **Runbooks & playbooks**: Canary raise plan, chaos drill, DR procedures, acceptance checklists.
4) **Supply chain hooks**: SBOM mentions (CycloneDX/Syft), cosign signing, trivy/grype references, Dependabot enabled, commitlint + CODEOWNERS.
5) **API/contract discipline**: OpenAPI specs, GraphQL codegen/guards, contract-test workflow.

# Gaps & Risks (what will bite)

1) **CI sprawl & flakiness**
   - ~140+ workflows with overlapping responsibilities, placeholder steps (`echo`), and repeating logic → flaky, slow, hard to debug.
   - Action bot issues for failed pipelines accumulate (noise → alert fatigue). Concurrency/cancellation present in places but not universal.

2) **Secrets management inconsistencies**
   - `.env` files with dev credentials committed. Githooks and gitleaks exist, but policy isn’t consistently enforced.
   - Terraform variables include `master_password` instead of pulling from a managed secret (SSM/Secrets Manager). Sealed/External Secrets are referenced, not mandated.

3) **Security gates not mandatory**
   - SBOM/cosign/trivy referenced but not enforced as hard fail gates across all deploy paths. No centralized policy to block promotion on CRITICAL vulns or unsigned images.
   - No repo-wide SAST baseline (CodeQL/Semgrep) and no IaC scanners (tfsec/checkov/conftest) wired as required checks.

4) **Progressive delivery not uniform**
   - You have canary runbooks and Rollout manifests in places, but there’s no single reusable rollout pattern with automated rollback triggers tied to SLO burn/error budgets.

5) **Observability gaps**
   - Metrics/logs/traces present, but **SLO burn alerts** and **promotion health gates** aren’t clearly wired into CI/CD (e.g., "block promotion if burn rate > X").

6) **Terraform/IaC posture**
   - Remote state/backend, drift detection, and plan/test gating policies are not uniformly visible. Missing cost policy (budget guard) and least-privilege modules.

7) **DR/Backups verification**
   - Backups and DR runbooks exist, but there’s no **automated restore drill** (periodic snapshot restore & app smoke on the clone) with pass/fail criteria.

8) **Test signal quality**
   - Lots of tests across layers, but flaky e2e, no unified coverage budget, and insufficient hermetic data fixtures. Some Playwright/k6 present but not tied to release gates.

# High‑Impact Recommendations (prioritized)

## 0–2 Weeks — Quick Wins
1) **Freeze CI sprawl**: Create `ci/core.yml`, `ci/security.yml`, `ci/release.yml`, `ci/preview.yml` as **reusable** workflows. Migrate job logic into composite actions or `actionlint`-checked templates. Deprecate/archive the rest.
2) **Enforce secrets discipline**: Remove committed `.env` (keep `.env.example`), enable **pre-receive** server hook (or org policy) that rejects `.env*`/secrets. Mandate ExternalSecrets/SealedSecrets for K8s.
3) **Turn on must-pass gates**: Make Trivy/Grype, SBOM (CycloneDX), and Cosign **required checks** on PR and **environment protection rules** for stage/prod. Fail on CRITICAL vulns unless in approved-allowlist with expiry.
4) **Add SAST & IaC scanners**: Wire **CodeQL (JS/TS)** or **Semgrep**; **tfsec**/**checkov**; **OPA Conftest** for Helm/K8s (deny privileged pods, hostPath, :latest, etc.).
5) **Tame Dependabot**: Limit concurrency, group minor version bumps, auto-merge only patch + safe devDeps. Route the rest to weekly “deps train.”

## 2–6 Weeks — Foundation
1) **Golden reusable canary**: Standardize on **Argo Rollouts** or native Deployment canary with a single chart helper and policy. Wire **auto-rollback triggers** to error budget burn, 5xx rate, and p95 latency.
2) **Promotion policy via OPA**: Admission control that checks **cosign signature**, **SLSA provenance**, **vuln budget**, and **SBOM presence**. Block deploy if any gate fails. Add "reason-for-access" for emergency bypass with audit trail.
3) **Observability gates**: Add a `verify-release` job that queries Prometheus for **SLO burn < threshold**, alert silence, and synthetic checks (k6 smoke). Promotion only on green.
4) **Terraform hardening**:
   - Move all secrets to **AWS Secrets Manager/SSM Parameter Store** (data sources), never variables.
   - Enforce **remote state** + state locking (S3+DynamoDB or Terraform Cloud). Add `terraform validate` + `tflint` + `tfsec` gates.
   - Add **cost guard** policies (Infracost budget checks) to PR.
5) **DR drill automation**: Nightly/weekly job to **restore from backup to a scratch cluster/namespace**, run app smoke, publish artifact & dashboard. Failures page someone.

## 6–12 Weeks — Excellence
1) **SLSA L3+ provenance**: Build with GitHub OIDC → sign & attach provenance (in‑toto attestations). Verify in cluster with **cosign policy-controller**.
2) **Unified incident automation**: Runbook automation (Maestro) to execute rollback, scale-down, feature-flag kill switch, and smoke after action.
3) **Coverage and flake mgmt**: Enforce coverage floor by package; track **flake rate**; quarantine flaky tests; parallelize with shard-aware runners.
4) **Tenancy & data governance**: ABAC/OPA policies already exist — add **DPIA templates**, **retention TTLs**, and **dual-control deletes** wired to audit logs.

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata: { name: api }
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 10
        - pause: { duration: 10m }
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause: { duration: 20m }
      trafficRouting:
        nginx: {}
      abortScaleDownDelaySeconds: 30
```

## E) Terraform Secrets via SSM (pattern)
```hcl
data "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_password" {
  name = "/intelgraph/prod/db/password"
  with_decryption = true
}

module "aurora" {
  source           = "./modules/aurora"
  master_username  = "maestro"
  master_password  = data.aws_ssm_parameter.db_password.value
}
```

## F) SLO Burn Rate Alert (Prometheus)
```yaml
groups:
- name: api-slo
  rules:
  - alert: APIErrorBudgetBurn
    expr: (
      sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~"5.."}[5m]))
      /
      sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
    ) > 0.02
    for: 10m
    labels: { severity: critical }
    annotations:
      summary: "5xx too high (burning error budget)"
```

# Policy & Governance Upgrades
- **Branch protections**: require reviews from CODEOWNERS paths; block force-push; require status checks: core, security, preview, release.
- **Release approvals**: environment protection rules with **change review board** group + **reason-for-access** prompt.
- **Audit**: Ensure all CI secrets access and production deploys are captured with immutable logs, including who/why/when.
- **Data policy**: Enforce retention TTLs via scheduled jobs; add DPIA templates; dual-control deletes with witness records in the ledger.

---

# DR/BCP
- **Automated restore job** (weekly): Restore latest backup into `dr-verify-*` namespace, run `smoke:db` and a basic read path, publish result badge. Page on failure.
- **Cross-region replicas**: Confirm RPO/RTO targets; test failover monthly; document DNS/ingress cutover.

---

# Test Strategy Improvements
- **Hermetic fixtures** (ephemeral DB + deterministic seed). Freeze external HTTP with Nock/VCR.
- **Contract tests** run on PR with snapshot baselines (N-1/N-2) and fail fast on breaking changes.
- **Flake budget**: Track failure rate per suite; quarantine and auto-retry once; block merges if suite’s flake rate > threshold.

---

# 30/60/90 Execution Plan

**Day 0–30 (Stabilize)**
- Consolidate CI into 4 reusable workflows; add CodeQL/tfsec/Conftest.
- Remove `.env` files; enforce ExternalSecrets; migrate TF secrets to SSM/Secrets Manager.
- Make Trivy+Cosign hard gates; start SLO burn alerts.

**Day 31–60 (Secure & Automate)**
- Admission policies (cosign+SLSA+SBOM+vuln budget); Argo Rollouts canonical canary.
- DR restore automation; env protection rules; Dependabot train.

**Day 61–90 (Optimize & Prove)**
- SLSA L3 provenance; on-cluster verification.
- Coverage floors + flake budget; cost guard rails; quarterly chaos & restore drills with reports.

---

# Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done, per your standards)
- **All merges via protected PR** → green checks (core, security, preview when applicable).
- **Canary** with automated rollback working in stage; migration gates validated.
- **Dashboards green** with SLOs + alerts; burn rate wired to promotion gates.
- **Audits present** (immutable) for deploys/secrets access.
- **Runbooks updated** with current rollback/restore instructions & owners.

---

# Appendix — Notable Artifacts Observed
- Helm charts per service (client/server/neo4j/redis/etc.), preview env workflow, OTEL collector config, Grafana dashboards, OpenAPI specs, Terraform env stacks, runbooks (canary/chaos/DR), CODEOWNERS/commitlint, Dependabot & release-please scaffolding.
