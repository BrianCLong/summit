## Instant Rollback Procedures (Ready)

If SLO/SLA breach or cascade failure detected:

```bash
# Two-command instant rollback
kubectl argo rollouts abort maestro-server-rollout
kubectl argo rollouts promote maestro-server-rollout --to-revision=previous
```

**Recovery Time:** <30 seconds (Argo preserves prior ReplicaSet)

---

## Next Iteration Roadmap

### Quick Wins (Day-2 Hardening)

1. **Digest Lock in Helm:** Codify digest-pinning in chart values
2. **DLQ Replay API:** Expose `POST /admin/dlq/replay` with RBAC
3. **Breaker Admin API:** Circuit breaker open/close with audit trail
4. **SLO Policy Doc:** Formalize budget burn gates and deployment blocks

### Platform Parity (Optional)

- Extend OPA+budget guards to `/api/maestro/**`
- Ensure budget admission is authoritative on `POST /maestro/runs`
