# Tenant Programs Overview

## Governance Proving Ground
Tenant policies (such as isolation levels and allowed change classes) are verified via the **Governance Proving Ground**. This automated suite ensures that tenant-specific overlays (e.g., `natsec_high_security` blocking contract-affecting changes) are correctly enforced by the release pipeline.

See `docs/governance/GOVERNANCE_PROVING_GROUND_OVERVIEW.md` for details.
