# Summit Platform Data Visualization & Fusion vNext

## 1. Executive Summary
Summit already delivers explainable model introspection (IntelGraph) and modular intelligence dashboards. To seize category leadership we will: (1) extend immersive spatio-temporal exploration, (2) fuse multimodal signals with explicit uncertainty, and (3) automate provenance-rich narratives and counterfactual planning. The initiatives in this document yield patent-grade capabilities, shrink analyst time-to-finding by 35%+, and provide defensible differentiators not found in mainstream BI suites.

## 2. Current Platform Assessment
- **Interactive explainability:** IntelGraph exposes embeddings, attribution graphs, and class comparison for large-scale deep nets.
- **Data fusion & modeling:** Maestro/Conductor pipelines already orchestrate cross-source ingestion, ML predictions, and workflow automation.
- **Dashboards:** Static and streaming boards cover intelligence, proposal compliance, OSINT, and operational telemetry.
- **Extensibility:** Plugin-style connectors, APIs, and export flows integrate with downstream orchestration.

## 3. Competitive & Cross-Domain Landscape (2025)
| Segment | Exemplars | Core Strengths | Gaps vs. Summit Vision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise BI | Tableau, Power BI, Looker | Highly polished dashboards, AI chart suggestions | Minimal ML explainability, limited OSINT/scientific focus |
| Ops Observability | Grafana, Kibana | Time-series & infra telemetry | No multimodal fusion, limited decision support |
| No/Low-Code Analytics | Qlik, Sisense, Domo | Self-service, mobile, connectors | Weak in spatio-temporal analytics, little provenance |
| Vertical Intelligence | Penlink, Oracle Fusion Intelligence | Geo-temporal overlays, industry models | Proprietary, low flexibility, absent explainability |
| Research & Immersive | Space-time cube, AR/VR labs | Advanced spatio-temporal metaphors | Prototype-only, lack productionization, no narrative exports |
| AI-First Viz Startups | Polymer, Julius, Powerdrill | Automated story generation, NLP interfaces | Shallow modeling, weak governance/audit |

## 4. Gap Analysis & White-Space Opportunities
1. **Immersive explainable space-time exploration** that ties each visual element to model attribution, causal pathways, and provenance.
2. **Uncertainty-forward multimodal fusion** showing data freshness, model drift, and cross-modal corroboration/contradiction.
3. **Adaptive meta-visualization** that changes representations based on data density, modality, and analyst goals.
4. **Counterfactual scenario planning** with geospatial Pareto trade-offs and narrative outputs.
5. **Cryptographically signed provenance ledger** ensuring replayable, regulator-ready artifacts.

## 5. Patent-Aware Innovation Portfolio
| Module | Novelty Highlights | Prior Art Mitigation | Potential Claims |

| Explainability Graph Canvas | Time-evolving attribution and drift badges on graph edges | Graph UIs rarely integrate model lineage + citations | Display of temporally resolved attribution for graph analytics |
| Multimodal Event Lattice | Alignment/conflict visualization for asynchronous modalities | Multimodal perception patents target robotics, not analyst tooling | Lattice of latent alignment fields with confidence encoding |
| Generative Forecast Theater | Ensemble “director” selecting model families per region with narrative rationale | Forecast UIs lack multi-model explainability | Ensemble orchestration UI with signed rationale |
| Causal Flow Maps | Animated geospatial Sankey of effect sizes with sensitivity overlays | Causal visualizations seldom geospatial + temporal | Methods for geo-causal flow animation with evidence drill-down |
| Provenance Ledger & Audit Lens | Cryptographically replayable analysis sessions, SBOM-backed outputs | Audit logs exist but not tied to viz sessions | Replayable, signed visualization provenance bundles |

## 12. IP & Patent Strategy
1. Conduct prior-art sweeps around counterfactual spatio-temporal visualization, provenance-signing workflows, and adaptive visualization policy engines.
2. Draft provisional claims for each module focusing on explainability integration, multimodal alignment visualization, and replayable provenance bundles.
3. Create claim charts referencing UI flows, data structures, and signing mechanisms; collaborate with counsel to prioritize filings aligned with roadmap milestones.
4. Establish invention disclosure pipeline within 6 weeks, capturing diagrams, interaction mockups, and algorithm descriptions.

## 13. Delivery Resources & Next Steps
- **Design:** Figma prototypes for Hypercube, Event Fields, and Scenario Dashboard (ETA Week 2).
- **Data:** Curate three demo datasets (synthetic incident fusion, mobility+sensor drift, multimodal OSINT) with sharing agreements.
- **Engineering Kits:** Turbo monorepo template with React/Node/Python services, GitHub Actions (OIDC, SLSA, cosign), IaC modules for AWS GPU workloads.
- **Operations:** Define governance policies (OPA), retention schedules, SBOM automation, and compliance checklists.
- **Enablement:** Produce playbooks, demo scripts, and narrative templates for sales, analysts, and partner ecosystems.

## 14. Immediate Actions
1. Socialize PRD with leadership; secure resourcing for XR experimentation and causal inference SMEs.
2. Begin prototype spikes: deck.gl Event Fields, Three.js hypercube slicing, SHAP-based attribution overlays.
3. Kick off patentability assessments and invention disclosures per module.
4. Schedule design sprints for meta-switchboard interactions and narrative exports; include compliance stakeholders.
5. Stand up telemetry collection to feed meta-visualization learning loops from day one.
