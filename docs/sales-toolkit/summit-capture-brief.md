# Capture Brief Template (Government / Prime Deals)

Use for every target opportunity. Keep it current and attach to the CRM opportunity.

## Opportunity Overview

- **Customer / Program / Vehicle**: <agency / program / IDIQ/BPA/OTA>
- **Mission objective**: <why this matters now>
- **Contract path**: <vehicle + ceiling> | **Timeline**: <milestones/due dates>
- **Deal size**: <$ value> | **Type**: Prime / Sub / Teaming

## Stakeholder Map

- **Champion**: <name, title, org, influence, access>
- **Economic buyer**: <name, budget owner>

- Desired outcomes: <measurable mission or risk goals>
- Consequences of inaction: <impact, cost, mission risk>

## Competitive Landscape

- Incumbents/alternatives: <who + status>
- Strengths/weaknesses: <ours vs them>
- Differentiators to emphasize: provenance, auditability, deployment speed, interoperability, responsible AI guardrails.
- Landmines to avoid: <e.g., custom dev risk, security claims you cannot prove>

## Technical & Security Fit

- Data sources: <systems/sensors/datasets + owners>
- Environments: <cloud/on-prem/IL level>, connectivity constraints, cross-domain needs.
- Identity & access: <IdP, RBAC/ABAC expectations>.
- Compliance: <ATO path, IL level, SBOM/SCRM requirements, logging, data residency>.
- Integrations: <APIs/queues/files; latency/volume expectations>.

## Proposed Approach
