# Outreach Kit (Email + LinkedIn)

Use these sequences by persona. Personalize with mission language, specific pain, and proof. Keep daily volume manageable and track replies.

## Daily Discipline

- Send 15–30 targeted touches/day (mix email + LinkedIn) across 3–5 accounts.
- Log every touch in CRM with template/version used; track opens, replies, meetings booked.
- Test 2 subject lines/week; keep winners and retire losers.
