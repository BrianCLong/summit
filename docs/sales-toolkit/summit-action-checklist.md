# Daily & Weekly Execution Checklist

Follow this cadence to keep momentum and hygiene high.

## Daily (Mon–Fri)

- [ ] Update CRM next actions for every active opp; log all touches.
- [ ] Send targeted outreach (15–30/day) using persona sequences; A/B test subject lines.
- [ ] Review inbound/security questions; send compliance kit snippets as needed.
- [ ] Advance or demote stages based on criteria; flag risks (no champion, budget unclear, security stall).
- [ ] Capture notes immediately after calls; link recordings and artifacts.

## Weekly Rhythm

- **Monday**
  - [ ] Prioritize 10–15 accounts for the week; assign owners.
  - [ ] Refresh `summit-icp-targets.md` with new accounts/contacts.
  - [ ] Plan sequences and offers for each active deal.
- **Wednesday**
  - [ ] Check pilot/proof progress; unblock data/identity/security access.
  - [ ] Prepare materials for any reviews (security, commercial, partner).
- **Friday**
  - [ ] Run the pipeline report from `summit-crm-pipeline.md` and share.
  - [ ] At-risk review: deals with no next step, no sponsor, or security lagging.
  - [ ] Document learnings (subject lines, objections, proof points that landed).

## Weekly Metrics

- Meetings booked, pilots proposed/accepted, velocity by stage.
- Security review turnaround, new champions, exec sponsors engaged.
- Outreach performance by persona (open/reply/meeting rate).

## Hygiene Rules

- No stage advancement without dated notes and next action.
- Keep contact data fresh; update research every quarter.
- Attach capture briefs, pilot offers, compliance artifacts to each opportunity.
- Block time for prospecting and follow-up daily; protect 90 minutes for deep research weekly.
