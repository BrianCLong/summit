# Ideal Customer Profile & Target List

Use this template to lock in your target segments, personas, and named accounts. Customize the placeholders, keep the tables up to date, and link to research artifacts for each account.

## Segmentation Overview

- **Primary segments (examples):**
  - Intelligence & defense (mission systems, secure data fusion)
  - State/local public safety (real-time coordination, dispatch)
  - Regulated critical infrastructure (energy, utilities, transportation)
  - Data-intensive enterprises (fraud/risk, anomaly detection)
- **Prioritization rubric:** strategic fit, urgency of mission, available budget/funding path, technical readiness, access to champions, competitive pressure.

## Personas & Pain Statements

Document 3–5 personas per segment with role-specific pains, success metrics, and proof points.

| Segment                 | Persona            | Core Pain                          | What They Value                                 | Best Proof                                    | Notes |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Intelligence/Defense    | Mission Owner / J2 | Slow intel fusion; delayed tasking | Faster targeting, provenance, speed to decision | Time-to-decision cuts, ATO-ready architecture |       |
| Intelligence/Defense    | CISO / AO          | Supply-chain risk, unknown SBOM    | Compliance posture, attestations, audit trails  | SBOM + penetration results, FedRAMP path      |       |
| Critical Infrastructure | Ops Director       | Outage risk, noisy alerts          | Reliability, MTTR improvements                  | Before/after MTTR, resilience drills          |       |
| Enterprise Risk         | Fraud Lead         | False positives, model drift       | Precision/recall, explainability                | Precision lift, drift monitoring              |       |

## Named Accounts Backlog

Start with 25–50 accounts per segment. Track current status, key contacts, and top hypothesis.

## Research Checklist (per account)

- Mission/mandate and FY budget/funding source (e.g., O&M, RDT&E, discretionary)
- Current stack and interoperability constraints (cloud, data sources, identity)
- Key stakeholders (mission owner, security, procurement, IT, operators)
- Recent awards/contracts, active vehicles (IDIQ/BPA/OTA), primes to team with
- Competitive landscape and incumbent solutions
- Security/compliance expectations (ATO level, enclave, data residency, SBOM, provenance)
- Urgency trigger (recent incident, mandate, audit finding, mission need)

## Data Hygiene Expectations

- Keep counts: **accounts added**, **contacts per account**, **sequences sent**, **meetings booked**
- Attach **capture briefs** and **pilot offers** for every active opportunity
- Refresh contact accuracy monthly; re-score fit quarterly

## Weekly Review Prompts

- Which 10 accounts moved forward? Which 5 stalled? Why?
- Where are we missing champions? Who can intro us (investors, advisors, primes)?
- What evidence or proof points accelerated momentum this week?
- Which sequences, subject lines, or offers converted best by persona?
