# Government Capability Statement

Tailor this 1-pager per agency/command. Keep language crisp, map proof points to the mission, and list only the controls you can defend.

## Who We Serve

- Missions: <agency/command/mission focus>
- Use cases: <examples: intel fusion, incident response, provenance/chain of custody, secure data exchange>
- Deployment: <IL level/enclave/cloud/on-prem>, <data residency>, <cross-domain posture>

## What We Deliver

- **Interoperable architecture**: Connects to existing data sources, identity, and messaging. Provenance built-in (signing, lineage, audit trail).
- **Secure-by-default**: SBOM + attestation, signed artifacts, least-privilege roles, encrypted transit/at-rest, tamper-evident logs.
- **Speed to mission**: Deploy pilots in weeks; prebuilt pipelines for fusion, alert triage, and analytic workflows.
- **Compliance ready**: FedRAMP path, RMF/ATO alignment, supply-chain controls, logging mapped to NIST 800-53/CSF.

## Differentiators

- **Provenance-first**: C2PA/cryptographic signing on ingests and outputs; human + AI actions traced end-to-end.
- **Analyst co-pilot**: Human-in-the-loop workflows with policy guardrails; audit-friendly decision support.
- **Multi-domain friendly**: Works in disconnected/air-gapped modes; supports cross-domain workflows with queue-based transfers.
- **Open/Extensible**: API-first, adapter kits for new sensors/datasets; reference implementations with primes.

## Recent Proof

- <Exercise or pilot> — <result: time-to-decision ↓ X%, false positives ↓ Y%, MTTR ↓ Z%>
- <Reference customer/mission> — <outcome/quote>
- <Security milestone> — <e.g., SBOM delivered, pentest completed, ATO path approved>

## Pilot Options (6–12 Weeks)

- **Mission lab**: Deploy in dev/test enclave with 2–3 priority data sources; success = validated detections + operator acceptance.
- **Ops pilot**: Limited-scope production with clear SOPs; success = live alerts with provenance, MTTR reduction, documented playbooks.
- **Integration sprint**: Build adapters to critical systems (e.g., data lake, identity, messaging bus); success = signed data flowing, dashboards live.

## Team & Credentials

- Core team: <roles/names> | Past performance: <programs/contracts> | Facility clearance: <level>
- Vehicles/partners: <IDIQ/BPA/OTA names>, <prime partners>, <set-aside status if applicable>
- Security artifacts available under NDA: SBOM, penetration test summary, architecture diagrams, SSP outline.

## Call To Action

- **Pick one**: (a) schedule a 30-min mission fit review, (b) select a pilot path, (c) request compliance package.
