# Execution Roadmap (Exec Summary)

A 1-page view of what to do this week and how to measure progress. Pair this with the CRM pipeline report.

## Next 7 Days

- Populate 25–50 accounts per segment in `summit-icp-targets.md`; assign owners.
- Launch 3 persona sequences (mission owner, CISO, partner) for top 10 accounts.
- Select 3–5 gov/prime opportunities and complete `summit-capture-brief.md` for each.
- Prep pilot offer drafts and compliance packet for the top 3 opportunities.
- Schedule weekly pipeline review with stage-by-stage hygiene checks.

## Weekly Cadence

- **Monday**: Target review + outreach plan; assign next actions per account.
- **Wednesday**: Discovery/pilot progress check; unblock security/commercial reviews.
- **Friday**: Pipeline scrub + at-risk dashboard; update metrics and send summary.
- **Monthly**: Re-score ICP fit; refresh sequences and proof points; rotate subject lines.

## Metrics to Watch

- Pipeline coverage (4–6x quota), meetings booked/week, pilots proposed vs accepted.
- Stage conversion rates and cycle time; touches-to-meeting by persona.
- Security review turnaround time; number of new champions and exec sponsors.
- Pilot success rate and conversion to production; ARR created/closed.

## FAQ Snippets

- **"How fast can we start?"** — Pilot within 2 weeks once data + identity access is cleared.
- **"Is this secure?"** — Provide compliance kit (SBOM, provenance, attestation, responsible AI) and offer 30–45 min review.
- **"Who else uses this?"** — Share sanitized mission stories with outcomes; offer reference call under NDA.
- **"What does support look like?"** — Named TAM, weekly standups, response times P1 <4h / P2 <1 biz day.
