# CRM Pipeline Backbone

Use this structure to operationalize your CRM. Stages include entrance/exit criteria, mandatory MEDDICC fields, and reporting guidance.

## Pipeline Stages & Criteria

1. **Targeting** — Account/persona identified, research started; contact data verified; capture brief stub created.
2. **Engaged** — First live interaction (call/email/social reply) or referral secured; champion hypothesis logged.
3. **Discovery** — Confirmed pain, timeline, success criteria; discovery call completed with notes attached; MEDDICC started.
4. **Solution Fit** — Demo/workshop delivered; architecture fit vetted (data, identity, deployment); security/compliance questions captured.
5. **Pilot/POC** — Pilot SOW agreed in principle; success metrics, duration, and pricing documented; project plan + owners assigned.
6. **Evaluation/Negotiation** — Commercials redlined; security/compliance package submitted; exec sponsor identified; procurement path confirmed.
7. **Commit/Close** — Final approvals obtained; order form/contract in flight; implementation kickoff scheduled.

> **Exit discipline:** No stage advancement without dated notes, attached artifacts (capture brief, pilot offer, compliance kit as requested), and owner assigned.

## Required Fields (per opportunity)

- **MEDDICC**: Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Implications of pain, Champion, Competition.
- **Sales hygiene**: Next action + due date, mutual action plan link, stage-entered date, risk flags, security requirements (ATO, SBOM, enclave), contract vehicle (e.g., IDIQ/BPA/OTA), prime/teaming partner.
- **Proof**: Demo recording link, pilot SOW link, compliance kit sent date, reference stories used.

## Hygiene Rules

- Update **next action** after every interaction; never leave without an owner/date.
- Keep **stage-entered dates** accurate for velocity tracking.
- Attach **meeting notes** and **recordings** to the opportunity; link capture brief and pilot SOW.
- Use **risk flags** early (no champion, budget unclear, security stall, procurement uncertainty).
- Run **weekly pipeline scrub** to demote stale deals and refresh probabilities.
