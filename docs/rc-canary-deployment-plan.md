  --namespace maestro-conductor-canary \
  --set canary.enabled=true \
  --set canary.weight=1 \
  --set image.tag=${RC_VERSION} \
  --set monitoring.enhanced=true

# Validate deployment
kubectl get pods -n maestro-conductor-canary
kubectl logs -f deployment/orchestrator-canary -n maestro-conductor-canary
```

### Monitoring Focus Areas
1. **Core Service Health**

   - Database connection pool stability
   - Redis cluster performance
   - Inter-service communication latency

2. **Workflow Execution**
   - SAGA pattern completion rates
   - Event sourcing consistency
   - Policy evaluation performance
   - Model routing accuracy

3. **Safety Guardrails**
   - Content filtering effectiveness
   - Rate limiting behavior
   - Authentication success rates
   - Authorization policy enforcement

### Go/No-Go Decision Points
**Hour 6**: Basic functionality validation
**Hour 12**: Performance baseline establishment
**Hour 24**: Stability confirmation
**Hour 48**: Phase 2 readiness assessment

## Canary Phase 2: 5% Early Adopters (72 hours)

### Target Scope
- **Traffic**: 5% of production load
- **Users**: Tier 1 customers (pre-selected early adopters)
- **Regions**: Primary + 1 secondary region
- **Features**: Full feature set except experimental ML features

### Customer Selection Criteria
- Active API usage >1000 requests/day
- Established integration patterns
- Dedicated support channel
- Signed canary participation agreement

### Enhanced Monitoring
```prometheus
# Key Prometheus Queries for Phase 2
rate(http_requests_total[5m])
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
increase(workflow_failures_total[1h])
rate(safety_violations_total[5m])
```

### Automated Rollback Triggers
```yaml
rollback_conditions:
  error_rate_threshold: 1.0%
  latency_p95_threshold: 1000ms
  availability_threshold: 99.5%
  customer_complaints: 3
  security_incidents: 1
```

### Customer Communication Plan
- **T-24h**: Notification of canary inclusion
- **T-0**: Deployment confirmation with monitoring links
- **T+6h**: Initial health check communication
- **T+24h**: Daily status reports begin
- **T+72h**: Phase completion summary

## Canary Phase 3: 25% Expanded Rollout (96 hours)

### Target Scope
- **Traffic**: 25% of production load
- **Users**: Extended customer base (all Tier 1, select Tier 2)
- **Regions**: All production regions
- **Features**: Complete feature set including ML platform

### Load Testing Integration
```bash
# Continuous load testing during Phase 3
artillery run ./tests/load/production-simulation.yml \
  --target https://api.maestro-conductor.com \
  --variables canary_weight=25 \
  --output phase3-load-test.json

# Real-time metrics streaming
artillery run ./tests/load/streaming-metrics.yml \
  --target wss://api.maestro-conductor.com/ws \
  --count 1000 \
  --rate 10
```

### Feature Flag Validation
- Gradual enablement of advanced features
- A/B testing for UI changes
- Progressive ML model deployment
- Federated learning experiment rollout

### Performance Benchmarks
```yaml
