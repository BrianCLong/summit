# Marketing & Content Strategy

## Core Pillars
1.  **The Cognitive Advantage**: Moving beyond "Data Analysis" to "Automated Reasoning."
2.  **Trust & Transparency**: The "Glass Box" AI (Provenance, Verification) vs. the "Black Box."
3.  **Sovereignty**: Your data, your models, your infrastructure (Air-gap narrative).
