# Why Summit Beats OpenClaw: The Enterprise Edge

**Summit Platform (Summit + Switchboard + white-label variants)**

## The Core Differentiator

While OpenClaw automates personal tasks (files, browser, shell), **Summit governs enterprise intelligence.** We treat AI agents as defensive intelligence assets, not just productivity bots.

---

### 1. Provable Security (vs. Peripheral Scanning)

- **Summit:** Policy-as-code (OPA/Rego) is baked into the runtime. Every action is governed by pinned policy bundles.
- **OpenClaw:** Relies on post-hoc scanning (VirusTotal) for skills that often inherit full system privileges.
- **The Edge:** Summit is secure by design; OpenClaw is secure by hope.

### 2. Cryptographic Provenance (vs. Basic Logging)

- **Summit:** Hash-chained audit trails provide tamper-evident records of "who did what, when, and under which policy."
- **OpenClaw:** Standard logging with no cryptographic integrity, making forensic reconstruction difficult in regulated environments.
- **The Edge:** Summit provides "provable" AI behavior for auditors and CISO teams.

### 3. Enterprise-Scale Architecture (vs. Single Gateway)

- **Summit:** Native four-repo architecture (IntelGraph, Maestro, CompanyOS, Switchboard) for governed ingestion, autonomic control, and intelligence fusion.
- **OpenClaw:** Primarily a single Gateway plus a skill marketplace, lacking the "intelligence fabric" needed for complex enterprise workflows.
- **The Edge:** Summit is built for the Intelligence Community and Enterprise Scale; OpenClaw is built for the Desktop.

### 4. Specialized Intelligence Tradecraft (vs. General RPA)

- **Summit:** Purpose-built for OSINT, threat intel, and espionage defense. Features graph-native analysis, STIX/MISP exports, and SIEM/SOAR integration.
- **OpenClaw:** General-purpose assistant focused on personal automation.
- **The Edge:** Summit speaks the language of the Analyst; OpenClaw speaks the language of the Assistant.

### 5. Compliance-Ready Evidence (vs. Operator Responsibility)

- **Summit:** Automatically generates and structures the evidence artifacts needed to prove controls for SOC2, ISO27001, and SSDF.
- **OpenClaw:** Leaves compliance evidence collection entirely to the operator's surrounding tools.
- **The Edge:** Summit is "Auditor-in-a-Box"; OpenClaw is another tool to audit.
