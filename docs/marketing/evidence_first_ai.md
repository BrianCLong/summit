# Evidence-First AI: The Summit Positioning

**Status:** Draft
**Audience:** C-Suite, Heads of Intelligence, CISOs

## The Problem: The "Black Box" Trust Gap

Enterprises are stalling their AI adoption because RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is fundamentally "flaky."
- It retrieves documents based on "vibes" (semantic similarity).
- It cannot guarantee that the answer today will match the answer tomorrow.
- It cannot prove *why* it selected a specific piece of evidence.

For regulated industries (Defense, Finance, Healthcare), this probabilistic approach is a non-starter.

## The Solution: Evidence-First AI

Summit is not just "GraphRAG." We are defining **Evidence-First AI**.

### Core Differentiators

1.  **Intent Compilation, Not Search**
    We don't just "search" for keywords. We compile user questions into rigid, deterministic logic (Intent Specs) before touching the data.

2.  **Evidence Budgeting**
    We treat "Context" as a scarce economic resource. Every query has a strict budget (nodes, edges, hops), ensuring reasoning never drifts into hallucination due to information overload.

3.  **Audit-Grade Traceability**
    Every claim is backed by a specific Cypher query and a set of immutable Evidence IDs. If the AI is wrong, you can debug the *query*, not just prompt-engineer the *model*.

## The "So What?"

*   **For the CISO:** "I can audit the exact data path for every AI output."
*   **For the Analyst:** "The system gives me the same answer every time I ask."
*   **For the CFO:** "We stop paying for wasted tokens and infinite retries."

## Tagline Candidates
*   *Summit: AI with a Chain of Custody.*
*   *Don't just Retrieve. Prove.*
*   *Deterministic Intelligence for a Probabilistic World.*
