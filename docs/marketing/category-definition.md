# Summit Category Definition: Information Integrity Infrastructure

## 1. The Old Category: Content Moderation (Why It Fails)

**Content Moderation** is a "game of whack-a-mole" focused on removing *bad posts*. It is reactive, manual, and doomed to fail against generative AI because:

* **Cost Asymmetry:** Generating toxin costs $0.0001; detecting it costs $0.01.
* **Scale:** Swarms can produce infinite unique variations of a lie.
* **Subjectivity:** "Truth" is hard to arbitrate; "Coordination" is physics.

## 2. The New Category: Information Integrity Infrastructure

**Summit** is not a moderation tool. It is **Critical Infrastructure Defense** for the cognitive domain. We don't just "flag content"; we **secure the information supply chain**.

## 3. Core Differentiation

| Feature | Content Moderation (Competitors) | Information Integrity (Summit) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target** | The Post (Content) | The Swarm (Coordination) |
| **Method** | Keyword/Classifier | Graph Topology & Entropy |
| **Output** | Takedown | Systemic Risk Score |
| **Defense** | Reactive | Predictive & Adaptive |
| **Value** | Compliance | Brand Sovereignty |

## 4. The "Why Now?" Narrative

"Generative AI has democratized information warfare. The tools used by nation-states in 2020 are now available to any teenager with a credit card. In this Zero-Trust Information Environment, **Attribution is the only durable Moat.** You cannot filter your way out of this; you must trace the swarm."
