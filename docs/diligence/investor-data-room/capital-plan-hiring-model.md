# Capital Plan & Hiring Model

This section describes the **12–18 month** capital plan in disciplined, category-based terms. It references internal cost and capacity documentation without disclosing sensitive budgets in this data room.

## 12–18 Month Investment Thesis (Category-Level)

Capital is allocated across the following buckets:

1. **Product & Platform Hardening**
   - Reliability, observability, and security posture improvements.
2. **Governance & Compliance Readiness**
   - Policy-as-code coverage, audit evidence generation.
3. **Data & Ingestion Reliability**
   - Data quality controls and ingestion stability.
4. **Customer Enablement & Deployment Readiness**
   - Documentation, onboarding, and operational readiness.

## Hiring Rationale & Pacing (Non-Exaggerated)

Hiring is paced to match roadmap capacity and operational readiness. We do not scale headcount beyond documented delivery capacity.

## Spend Elasticity & Kill Switches

Spend elasticity is enforced via budgeting controls and explicit stop conditions. Budget expansions require evidence that delivery and governance gates are holding.
