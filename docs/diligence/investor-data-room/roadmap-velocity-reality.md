# Roadmap & Velocity Reality

Roadmap statements are confidence-encoded and link to the source-of-truth roadmap artifacts. This section avoids timeline promises.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Engineering roadmap](../../ENGINEERING_ROADMAP_96_PROMPTS.md)
- [Capacity planning](../../CAPACITY_PLANNING.md)
- [OKRs](../../OKRs.md)

## Confidence-Encoded Roadmap View

| Horizon               | Confidence | Description                                                                                    | Evidence                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Now (0–3 months)**  | High       | GA hardening, operational readiness, and risk mitigation aligned to current release artifacts. | [GA release checklist](../../GA_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) |
| **Near (3–6 months)** | Medium     | Incremental capability expansion tied to documented roadmap items.                             | [Roadmap](../../ROADMAP.md)                           |
| **Mid (6–12 months)** | Low–Medium | Exploratory items and larger platform evolutions; no commitments without gating evidence.      | [Roadmap](../../ROADMAP.md)                           |

## Capacity & WIP Constraints

Capacity is governed by explicit planning artifacts and workflow controls. We do not over-allocate or promise delivery beyond documented capacity.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Release cadence](../../RELEASE_CADENCE.md)
- [Engineering change workflow](../../ENGINEERING_CHANGE_WORKFLOW_V0.md)

## Committed vs. Exploratory Work

- **Committed**: Items explicitly listed as deliverables in the roadmap and GA artifacts.
- **Exploratory**: Items not backed by readiness criteria; treated as research only.

Any reclassification requires updated evidence in the roadmap and status reporting.
