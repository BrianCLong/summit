# Governance & Compliance Posture

This section reflects **current, documented posture**. It does not promise certification outcomes.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Governance overview](../../GOVERNANCE.md)
- [Compliance controls](../../COMPLIANCE_CONTROLS.md)
- [SOC mapping](../../COMPLIANCE_SOC_MAPPING.md)
- [ISO mapping](../../COMPLIANCE_ISO_MAPPING.md)

## Compliance Frameworks in Scope

Frameworks tracked in documentation include SOC-style control mappings and ISO-aligned mappings. Evidence generation is documented and tied to controls.

## Evidence Generation Approach

Evidence is produced and indexed via documented control artifacts and compliance mappings.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Compliance evidence index](../../COMPLIANCE_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md)
- [Audit and compliance](../../AUDIT_AND_COMPLIANCE.md)

## Audit Readiness Stance (No Overclaim)

Audit readiness is approached as **continuous evidence readiness**, not a guarantee of external certification. Any claims beyond documented artifacts are excluded from this data room.
