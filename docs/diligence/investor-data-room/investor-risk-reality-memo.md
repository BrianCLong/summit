# Investor Risk & Reality Memo

## What Summit Is Building

Summit is an intelligence analysis platform with AI-augmented graph analytics, focused on investigatory workflows and governed operations. The GA scope is defined by current release artifacts and readiness criteria.

**Evidence pointers**

- [MVP3 GA execution artifacts](../../MVP3_GA_EXECUTION_ARTIFACTS.md)
- [GA criteria](../../GA_CRITERIA.md)

## Why It Is Credible

- **Documented GA scope**: release artifacts show what is live and validated.
- **Governance guardrails**: policy and claims controls are documented and enforced.
- **Evidence-driven posture**: compliance and security artifacts are tracked and versioned.

**Evidence pointers**

- [GA release checklist](../../GA_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)
- [Governance policies](../../GOVERNANCE-POLICIES.md)
- [Compliance evidence index](../../COMPLIANCE_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md)

## What Risks Remain

The risk posture is conservative and openly documented. Major risks include data quality variance, evolving regulatory scope, security threats, performance scaling, and AI misuse. These risks are tracked and are not presented as fully eliminated.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Risk ledger](../../RISK_LEDGER.md)
- [Threat model](../../THREAT_MODEL.md)

## Why Those Risks Are Managed (Not Ignored)

Mitigation is grounded in documented controls and governance escalation paths. Risks remain tracked unless the control evidence shows material reduction.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Security action plan](../../SECURITY_ACTION_PLAN.md)
- [Governance](../../GOVERNANCE.md)
- [Incident signal map](../../INCIDENT_SIGNAL_MAP.md)

## Bottom Line

This data room is designed to prevent surprises. It is factual, conservative, and aligned to evidence that can be audited later.
