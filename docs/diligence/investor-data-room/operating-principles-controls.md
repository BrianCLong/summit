# Operating Principles & Controls

This section explains **why future behavior is predictable**: governance, escalation, and claims controls are documented and enforced.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Governance policies](../../GOVERNANCE-POLICIES.md)
- [Engineering change workflow](../../ENGINEERING_CHANGE_WORKFLOW_V0.md)
- [Golden path](../../GOLDEN_PATH.md)

## Graduation Rules

Graduation rules define when features move from development to GA exposure. These rules are explicit and documented.

**Evidence pointers**

- [GA criteria](../../GA_CRITERIA.md)
- [GA release checklist](../../GA_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)

## Risk Escalation Model

Risk escalation is handled through documented governance and incident workflows.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Governance](../../GOVERNANCE.md)
- [Incident signal map](../../INCIDENT_SIGNAL_MAP.md)
- [Runbook](../../RUNBOOK.md)

## Narrative & Claims Guardrails

Product narrative and claims are bounded by documented policy and evidence. Anything not supported is excluded.

**Evidence pointers**

- [GTM claims matrix](../../GTM_CLAIMS_MATRIX.md)
- [GA governance](../../GA_GOVERNANCE.md)
