# Product & Architecture Evidence

## MVP-3-GA Scope Definition

The MVP-3 GA scope is defined by the GA criteria and execution artifacts. This data room does not expand scope beyond those documents.

**Evidence pointers**

- [MVP3 GA execution artifacts](../../MVP3_GA_EXECUTION_ARTIFACTS.md)
- [GA criteria](../../GA_CRITERIA.md)
- [GA release checklist](../../GA_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)

## Frontend + Backend Graduation Model

Graduation is governed by documented GA and golden-path gates.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Golden path](../../GOLDEN_PATH.md)
- [GA readiness checklist](../../GA_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)
- [Launch scope](../../LAUNCH_SCOPE.md)

## Golden-Path Contracts Overview

Golden-path contracts define minimum viable, testable workflows and guardrails that align product claims with operational reality.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Golden path](../../GOLDEN_PATH.md)
- [Golden path platform docs](../../golden-path-platform)
- [Golden path specs](../../golden-path)

## Demo Exposure Controls

Demonstrations must reflect GA scope and use the same controls and policies as production workflows.

**Evidence pointers**

- [GA demonstration summary](../../PHASE3_DEMONSTRATION_SUMMARY.json)
- [Security and privacy guidance](../../SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md)

## Architecture Overview (Evidence Only)

Architecture is documented and versioned; this data room references the latest published design artifacts.

**Evidence pointers**

- [Architecture](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [GA architecture](../../GA_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Security architecture](../../SECURITY.md)
