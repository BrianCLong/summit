In the event of anticipated litigation or investigation, a **Legal Hold** will be issued.

- **Action:** All destruction of relevant documents must cease immediately.
- **Scope:** The hold notice will specify the types of records and custodians affected.
- **Compliance:** Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action and legal penalties.

## Diligence Readiness

All "Permanent" and active "7 Years" documents must be indexed in the Virtual Data Room.
