# Persistent Memory Fabric Blueprint

## Vision
The next generation of Summit memory systems must deliver durable cognition across a spectrum of temporal horizons. We aim to unify short, mid, long, and cross-term persistence so that every interaction compounds into institutional intelligence. The blueprint below expands the existing thread, cross-thread, and fabric layers by introducing new memory technologies, governance models, and adaptive orchestration primitives that transform episodic exchanges into living knowledge.

## Memory Horizon Stack
| Horizon | Operational Goals | Key Signals | Primary Stores | Example Technologies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Short-Term (STS)** | Preserve conversational context within a live session; deliver sub-second recall. | Recent utterances, tool outcomes, unresolved actions. | In-memory vector cache, temporal key-value store. | NVMe-backed Redis, streaming embeddings, sketch-based saliency filters. |
| **Mid-Term (MTS)** | Maintain continuity across a working day or task cluster; support rapid summarization and intent tracking. | Task plans, drafts, feedback loops, partial approvals. | Incremental document graph, operational logbook. | CRDT-backed workspace journal, queryable changefeed snapshots, temporal graph DB (Memgraph). |
| **Long-Term (LTS)** | Encode institutional knowledge and policies; enable longitudinal learning. | Approved content, governance audits, reviewer preferences. | Knowledge lake with lineage, compliance vault. | Object storage with Delta Lake ACID, immutable ledger (ProvDB), semantic layer with RDF/OWL. |
| **Cross-Term Perspective (XTS)** | Synthesize insights spanning all horizons; detect drift, opportunities, and risk. | Horizon deltas, cohort trends, human feedback loops. | Perspective fabric indexing service. | Multimodal analytics mesh, adaptive retrieval orchestrator, causal inference engine. |

## Expanded Memory Technologies
1. **NeuroWeave Context Mesh**  
   - Bi-directional attention bus connects STS caches to MTS journals with latency budgets defined by conversational criticality.  
   - Implements adaptive compression (Fourier feature hashing + reservoir sampling) to prioritize salient history without losing anomaly traces.  
   - Supports _pre-emptive context inoculation_: upcoming agent tools receive distilled summaries before invocation.

2. **Chronicle Delta Ledger**  
   - Append-only fabric merging CRDT task states with policy proofs; anchors each memory write to verifiable governance artifacts.  
   - Delta diffs compiled into "perspective packets" that propagate to XTS analytics after human approval or automated confidence scoring.  
   - Includes selective forgetting protocol with cryptographic tombstones to honor retention requirements.

3. **Perspective Prism Engine**  
   - Cross-horizon analytics service that fuses time-series embeddings, user personas, and success metrics.  
   - Generates **Perspective Cards** for agents and humans, combining LTS heuristics with live STS signals for balanced decision-making.  
   - Embeds fairness auditors that monitor for feedback loop bias and drift.

4. **Fabric Intelligence Plane**  
   - Observability and orchestration layer using event-driven pipelines (Kafka + Flink) to route memory packets.  
   - Performs automated test-and-learn experiments (A/B/C) by cloning context slices across simulated threads.  
   - Maintains SLA manager for recall latency, write durability, and compliance gates.

## Thread & Fabric Innovations
- **Thread Minders:** Lightweight runtime companions that attach to each agent session, instrumenting STS behaviors and pushing annotated checkpoints into MTS journals. Thread Minders use self-describing schemas to remain tool-agnostic.
- **Cross-Thread Relay:** Gossip-style propagation of lessons learned; when one thread resolves a novel scenario, the relay emits a perspective card to similar active threads while respecting privacy segmentation.
- **Perspective Fabric Contracts:** Declarative policies describing how memory packets can traverse horizons. Contracts encode governance tags, required approvals, and automated sanitization routines.
- **Feedback Amplifiers:** Humans can flag perspective cards with "adopt", "watch", or "retire" signals, training reinforcement channels that adjust context weighting across horizons.

## Memory Lifecycle
1. **Ingest & Draft** – New interactions land in STS caches with probabilistic tagging for downstream horizons.
2. **Interrupt Handling** – Alerts trigger immediate summarization and injection into Perspective Prism for priority triage.
3. **Human Review & Approval** – Agents present structured memory updates; approvers receive XTS-backed rationale and can request counterfactual rewrites.
4. **Long-Term Encoding** – Approved packets merged into Chronicle Delta Ledger with lineage references and knowledge graph linking.
5. **Perspective Refresh** – Periodic jobs synthesize cross-term perspectives, updating Fabric Intelligence Plane dashboards and retriever warmstarts.

## R&D Roadmap
- **Q2:** Implement NeuroWeave pilot with selective forgetting metrics; integrate with existing interrupt workflow.  
- **Q3:** Launch Chronicle Delta Ledger alpha, including governance proofs and retention automation.  
- **Q4:** Ship Perspective Prism beta with causal analytics and fairness watchdog.  
- **Q1 (next year):** General availability of Fabric Intelligence Plane, powering autonomous A/B testing and SLA governance.

## Metrics & Evaluation
- **Recall Fidelity:** Percentage of human-validated details preserved across horizon transitions. Target ≥95% for mission-critical workflows.
- **Latency Budgets:** STS recall <150 ms p95; MTS summarization <1 s; LTS retrieval <3 s with caching; XTS analytics <5 s for on-demand perspective cards.
- **Governance Coverage:** 100% of LTS writes carry perspective contracts; <1% policy exceptions per quarter.
- **Learning Velocity:** Measure number of actionable Perspective Cards adopted per week and downstream automation gains.

## Open Research Questions
- Balancing memory compression with explainability for regulated domains.  
- Designing counterfactual simulation frameworks that safely test alternative memory propagation strategies.  
- Harmonizing human override signals with autonomous adaptation without oscillation.
