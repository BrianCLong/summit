# 🚀 Master Prompt: IntelGraph Supercharged MVP Development

> **IntelGraph** is a production-ready AI-augmented intelligence analysis platform.
> **Current Status: MVP-0 Complete, MVP-1 In Progress**
> 
> Our core philosophy: **1) Always keep a working, deployable build** (smoke tests must pass).
> **2) Accelerate MVP feature delivery** with enterprise-grade quality.
> **3) Ship production-ready code with comprehensive testing, observability, and security.**

## 🎯 Current Production Status

✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - All MVP-0 features complete and validated
- ✅ Complete development environment with health checks
- ✅ Postgres persistence for Copilot runs/tasks/events  
- ✅ CSV + STIX/TAXII data ingestion pipeline
- ✅ OPA security policies with 150+ test cases
- ✅ OpenTelemetry observability and Prometheus metrics
- ✅ Graph Performance Mode (10k+ nodes)
- ✅ Golden Path Wizard and Enhanced Copilot Panel
- ✅ Comprehensive smoke testing suite

## 🔥 Core Development Principles

### 1. **Deployability First (Non-Negotiable)**
```bash
# Every feature must pass these gates:
make up                    # ✅ Environment starts cleanly
make smoke                 # ✅ Full golden path works
node scripts/smoke-test-simple.js  # ✅ Quick validation
```

**Never merge if:**
- Docker Compose fails to start
- Smoke tests fail (0% tolerance)
- Golden path breaks (investigation → entities → Copilot → results)
- Health checks fail or timeout

### 2. **Feature Velocity (Ship Fast, Ship Right)**

**MVP-1 Priority Stack** (High → Medium → Low):
```
🔥 HIGH (Production Blockers):
  - Security scanning (Gitleaks, Trivy) in CI
  - Backup/disaster recovery procedures  
  - Performance testing and optimization
  - OTLP exporter configuration

⚡ MEDIUM (Value Multipliers):
  - Redis Streams event replay
  - Advanced graph clustering algorithms
  - OSINT API connectors (Shodan, VirusTotal)
  - Temporal analysis and timeline views

🎯 LOW (Future Scale):
  - GNN link prediction models
  - Federated graph queries
  - Advanced AI analytics pipeline
```

**MVP-2+ Stretch Goals** (Don't block MVP-1):
- Multi-modal AI analysis (text, images, documents)
- Real-time collaborative investigations
- Advanced threat hunting workflows
- Enterprise SSO integration

### 3. **Production-Grade Code Standards**

**Architecture Requirements:**
- ✅ **Observability**: Every new API emits OpenTelemetry spans + Prometheus metrics
- ✅ **Security**: All operations go through OPA policy engine
- ✅ **Performance**: Handle 10k+ graph nodes smoothly
- ✅ **Reliability**: Graceful degradation and error recovery
- ✅ **Testing**: Unit + integration + smoke test coverage

**Code Quality Gates:**
```bash
# Before any commit:
npm run lint               # ESLint + Prettier
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript validation  
npm run test               # Unit tests
make smoke                 # Integration validation

# Conventional commits required:
feat(copilot): add event replay capability
fix(graph): resolve clustering performance issue
docs(api): update GraphQL schema documentation
```

### 4. **CI/CD Production Alignment**

**Required for every PR:**
- ✅ All smoke tests pass (blocking)
- ✅ Security scans clean (no high severity)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks stable
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Metrics/tracing instrumented

**Infrastructure as Code:**
```bash
# Keep these updated:
.env.example               # New configuration options
docker-compose.dev.yml     # Service dependencies
scripts/smoke-test.js      # Feature validation
monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json  # New metrics
server/policies/           # Security policies
```

### 5. **Developer Experience Excellence**

**30-Second Start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brianlong/intelgraph.git
cd intelgraph && cp .env.example .env
make up                    # Full environment in Docker
make smoke                 # Verify everything works
# ✅ Ready to code!
```

**Development Loop:**
```bash
# Daily workflow:
make up                    # Start services
npm run dev               # Hot reload development  
make smoke                # Validate changes
git commit -m "feat: ..."  # Ship when ready
```

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
