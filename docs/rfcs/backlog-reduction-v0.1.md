# RFC: Systemic Backlog Reduction v0.1

## Problem Statement
The current backlog size and growth rate are actively harming the project's velocity and contributor morale. Key issues include:
- **High Triage Cost**: Every new issue must be evaluated against an ever-growing pile of stale or duplicate tickets.
- **Review Drag**: Large backlogs obscure priority work, leading to slower PR reviews and decision-making.
- **Duplicate Work**: Contributors frequently start work on issues that have already been partially addressed or are duplicates of closed tickets.
- **Reduced Signal**: Important bugs are lost in the "noise" of low-priority or vague feature requests.

## Principles
- **Close by Default**: Issues without an active owner AND clear acceptance criteria will be closed.
- **Evidence-First**: We do not keep issues that lack reproducible evidence (for bugs) or clear business value (for features).
- **Consolidate Duplicates**: Favor single "Epic" issues for themes over dozens of micro-tickets.
- **Taxonomy as Control Plane**: Labels are not just metadata; they drive the automation and triage lifecycle.

## Policy: Disposition Criteria

### 1. Close
- Stale (> 90 days) without active discussion or assignee.
- Missing reproduction steps for bugs (after 7-day grace period).
- Non-actionable "feature ideas" without a proposed implementation path.

### 2. Keep
- High-priority bugs with a clear repro.
- Actively developed features with a dedicated owner.
- Compliance/Security requirements.

### 3. Convert-to-Epic
- Related micro-tasks that share a common goal should be merged into a single Epic issue.

### 4. Merge
- Direct duplicates of existing issues.

## Process

### Weekly Sweep Cadence
- **Day Captain**: A rotating role responsible for the weekly "Sweep Day".
- **Maintainer Review**: Every Friday, maintainers review the "Proposed for Closure" list generated by the Day Captain or automation.
- **Definition of Active**: An issue is active if it has a comment or update from a human in the last 30 days, or is linked to an open PR.

### Roles
- **Day Captain**: Triages new issues, labels them, and flags stale ones.
- **Maintainer**: Makes final "Close/Keep" decisions on contested issues.
- **Triage Bot**: Automatically labels issues missing templates and flags staleness.

## Automation Hooks
- **Labels**:
  - `stale`: Automatically applied after 60 days of inactivity.
  - `needs-repro`: Triggers a 7-day timer for closure if no repro is provided.
  - `backlog-sweep`: Used to track issues currently under review.
- **GitHub Actions**:
  - Check for issue template completion.
  - Periodic sweeps to nag/close stale issues.
- **Issue Templates**: Mandatory fields for "Evidence/Reproduction" and "Acceptance Criteria".

## Metrics
- **Backlog Burn-down**: Net change in open issues per week.
- **Mean Issue Age**: Average time from creation to resolution/closure.
- **Evidence Rate**: % of issues with a "repro-verified" or "has-evidence" label.
- **Reopen Rate**: % of closed issues that are reopened within 30 days (target < 5%).

## Risk + Rollback
- **Accidental Closure**: All closure comments include a template explaining *why* it was closed and how to reopen it (provide evidence/owner).
- **Audit Trail**: Use a specific `closed-by-sweep` label to allow easy bulk-reopening if a sweep policy is found to be too aggressive.

## Appendix

### Example Closure Comment Template
> "Thank you for your contribution! As part of our systemic backlog reduction (see RFC v0.1), we are closing issues that have been inactive for >90 days or lack specific reproduction steps. If this is still a priority, please provide [missing info] and we will be happy to reopen it."

### Core Label Set
- `type/bug`, `type/feature`, `type/epic`
- `status/triage`, `status/active`, `status/stale`
- `priority/p0` (blocker), `priority/p1` (high), `priority/p2` (standard)
- `resolution/duplicate`, `resolution/wontfix`, `resolution/stale`
