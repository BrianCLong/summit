# RFCs (Requests for Comments)

This directory contains Requests for Comments (RFCs), which are formal proposals for significant changes, new features, or systemic policies within the IntelGraph ecosystem.

## Purpose

The goal of the RFC process is to ensure that major decisions are well-documented, debated, and aligned with the project's strategic goals before implementation begins.

## RFC Lifecycle

1.  **Draft**: The proposal is being written and is not yet ready for formal review.
2.  **Review**: The proposal is open for feedback from the community and stakeholders.
3.  **Approved**: The proposal has been accepted and is ready for implementation.
4.  **Rejected**: The proposal has been declined with a clear rationale.
5.  **Implemented**: The proposed changes have been fully merged and deployed.
6.  **Deprecated**: The RFC has been superseded by a newer proposal or is no longer relevant.

## How to Submit an RFC

1.  Copy a previous RFC or use a template (if available).
2.  Create a new file in this directory following the naming convention `[ID]-[short-description].md` or `[description]-v[version].md`.
3.  Open a Pull Request and label it as `type/rfc`.
