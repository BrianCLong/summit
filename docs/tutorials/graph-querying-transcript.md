# Transcript: Graph Querying Essentials

**Recording placeholder:** https://loom.com/share/TBD-graph-querying

**Duration:** ~3 minutes

---

**00:00 – 00:12**  
"Welcome back! In this session we'll explore the IntelGraph knowledge graph using the built-in Graph Console."

**00:12 – 00:28**  
"Navigate to the Analytics area and open the console. Here you'll find curated templates for common investigative questions, plus a custom Cypher editor when you need full control."

**00:28 – 00:48**  
"I'll start with the 'Find Related Threat Actors' template. One click runs a pre-built Cypher query, returning both a force-directed visualization and a tabular list of connected actors."

**00:48 – 01:10**  
"To answer more specific questions, switch to the Custom Query tab. I'm pasting a Cypher pattern that looks for campaigns associated with a particular actor, then setting the name parameter to Aurora Cell."

**01:10 – 01:32**  
"Run the query with Shift plus Enter. The results appear instantly, and I can filter the graph by confidence, expand neighboring nodes, or pin key entities to craft the investigative story."

**01:32 – 01:58**  
"Happy with the outcome? Save the query as 'Aurora Campaign Pivot' and share it with your team so everyone benefits from a vetted analytic starting point."

**01:58 – 02:35**  
"When you need to brief stakeholders, export the table to CSV or download the visualization as a PNG snapshot. That's the end-to-end workflow for graph querying inside IntelGraph."

**02:35 – 03:00**  
"Thanks for watching! Jump into the advanced docs linked below to learn how to add algorithmic scoring or schedule recurring graph jobs."
