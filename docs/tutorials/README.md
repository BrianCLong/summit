# Tutorial Video Library

This directory hosts scripts, transcripts, and planning guides for IntelGraph onboarding videos. Use these resources to record short, high-impact walkthroughs for new team members.

## Recording Checklist

1. Review the script for your topic and adapt any environment details to match the target deployment.
2. Use Loom for quick screen captures or OBS Studio when you need multiple scenes, webcam overlays, or advanced audio routing.
3. Record at 1080p, 30fps with system audio. Capture microphone narration in a quiet space and monitor levels to avoid clipping.
4. After recording, export captions from the matching transcript file to ensure accessibility compliance.
5. Replace the placeholder Loom URL in each script and transcript once the final video is uploaded.
