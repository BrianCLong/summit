# Dev Kit Local Development

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This document describes a legacy workflow using a `./dev` script that is no longer standard.
>
> Please use the **[Developer Enablement Pack](../planning/enablement-pack/README.md)** and the **[Onboarding & Quickstart](../planning/enablement-pack/onboarding-quickstart.md)** guide for the current supported workflows.

The canonical command to start the development environment is now:

```bash
pnpm run docker:dev
```

or for local app development:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
