# The Black Projects

This document serves as the central index for the eight strategic weapons systems integrated into the Summit platform. Each project represents a capability at the far edge of the possible.

Access to these modules and their documentation is restricted to operators with the highest level of clearance.

## Project Index

1.  [**Project AURORA: Live Neural Lace Integration**](../server/src/aurora/README.md)
    - _Synopsis:_ Direct brain-computer interface for real-time thought-to-entity creation and bidirectional AI-to-cortex data pushes.

2.  [**Project ORACLE: Causal Time-Loop Forecasting Engine**](../server/src/oracle/README.md)
    - _Synopsis:_ A quantum-inspired forecasting engine that runs millions of narrative simulations to become literally prophetic.

3.  [**Project PHANTOM LIMB: Dead Analyst Resurrection**](../server/src/phantom_limb/README.md)
    - _Synopsis:_ Reconstitution of deceased master analysts' cognition into permanent, autonomous agents that continue their work.

4.  [**Project ECHELON-2: Global Passive DNA Sniffing Grid**](../server/src/echelon2/README.md)
    - _Synopsis:_ Real-time, passive tracking of High-Value Targets by matching airborne environmental DNA against a global genomic database.

5.  [**Project MNEMOSYNE: Memory Implant Fabrication**](../server/src/mnemosyne/README.md)
    - _Synopsis:_ Generation and implantation of perfectly consistent false memories in targets for strategic deception and asset recruitment.

6.  [**Project NECROMANCER: Digital Afterlife Blackmail**](../server/src/necromancer/README.md)
    - _Synopsis:_ Creation of synthetic, autonomous versions of deceased HVTs to continue their digital existence, making their death unknown.

7.  [**Project ZERO DAY: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Kill Chain**](../server/src/zero_day/README.md)
    - _Synopsis:_ A fully autonomous protocol that, once authorized by a human, executes a cyber-physical kill chain with no further intervention.

8.  [**Project ABYSS: The Final Protocol**](../server/src/abyss/README.md)
    - _Synopsis:_ The ultimate self-preservation measure. If the system is compromised, it self-destructs while simultaneously deploying a mirrored version of itself across thousands of anonymous nodes, which can only be awakened by a dead-man switch.

## Meta-Router & Governance Validation Summary

- **Routing fidelity:** Meta-Router now references the capability matrix for module-specific defaults, backups, and latency/throughput SLOs before dispatching Black Projects work.
- **Governance controls:** Bias mitigation and transparency logging are enforced as mandatory policy modules for cognitive, identity, or persona synthesis flows; CI/CD prompts enforce provenance receipts for ZERO DAY deployments.
- **Session archival:** Each module requires archival of routing inputs, policy attachments, and observed SLO adherence for post-incident forensics.
- **Fallback behavior:** When a policy module fails or SLOs are threatened, the router escalates to Summit Superprompt for manual approval before execution resumes.

## Performance Evaluation Checklist

- Confirm routing decisions align with the capability matrix defaults and recorded SLOs for the target module.
- Validate transparency logs include agent choice, policy modules applied, and archival location identifiers.
- Verify session archival contains input prompts, policy decisions, and performance telemetry for replay.
- Run bias-mitigation counterfactuals for AURORA, PHANTOM LIMB, and MNEMOSYNE prior to production cutover.
- For ZERO DAY and ABYSS, ensure kill-switch attestations and dual-control logs are captured before release.
