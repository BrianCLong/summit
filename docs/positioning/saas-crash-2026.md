# SaaS Crash 2026 Positioning Pack (saas-crash-2026)

**Status:** Active.
**Primary sources:** See `docs/positioning/claim-registry.md`.

## Summit Readiness Assertion

This positioning pack is aligned with the Summit Readiness Assertion and is
prepared for governance-first review and evidence gating.

## Evidence-Backed Claims (External)

These statements are grounded exclusively in the claim registry:

- Market fears center on AI pressure in the application layer and large-scale
  software drawdowns. (ITEM:CLAIM-01)
- The “seat-count compression” mechanism is a primary SaaS downside scenario.
  (ITEM:CLAIM-03)
- IGV drawdown is framed at ~22% in multiple sources. (ITEM:CLAIM-04,
  ITEM:CLAIM-05)
- AI agent systems remain error-prone in regulated workflows, reinforcing the
  need for auditability and governance-first systems. (ITEM:CLAIM-07)
- The counterpoint that “AI replaces tools” is illogical is on record and
  informs Summit’s “tools + governance” framing. (ITEM:CLAIM-02)
- Bootstrapped companies can reach $1M ARR in ~2 years, only slightly slower
  than VC-backed peers. (ITEM:CLAIM-06)

## Summit Original Positioning

**Sovereign OSINT Moat (Summit original):**
Summit’s moat is built on sovereign, air-gapped, and regulated OSINT operations
where determinism, auditability, and policy-as-code enforcement are mandatory.

**Tools + Governance (Summit original):**
Summit positions AI as an accelerator for governed tooling, not a replacement
for the tooling itself.

**Seat-Count Resilience (Summit original):**
Summit’s value is tied to mission-critical workflows and governed evidence
outputs rather than pure seat-count growth.

## Regulated Reliability Guidance (Summit original)

- **Deny-by-default** policy enforcement with audited exceptions.
- **Provenance-first** output artifacts with deterministic formats.
- **Evidence IDs** embedded in every exported payload.

## Product Wedges (Summit original)

- **Compliance Drift Monitor:** Tracks policy drift, evidence gaps, and audit
  signals in regulated environments.
- **Narrative Intel Pack:** Extractive narrative monitoring for sovereign OSINT
  with deterministic evidence outputs.

## Positioning Constraints

- Avoid competitor comparisons without sourced evidence.
- Avoid investment language or market advice.
- Treat all non-claim content as **Summit original** or **ASSUMPTION**.

## Next Actions

- Publish supporting standards and evidence schema in
  `docs/standards/saas-crash-2026.md`.
- Implement deterministic drift monitor with fixture-based validation.
- Add security/ops guidance for data handling and runbooks.
