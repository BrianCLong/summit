## Executive Summary

Summit is not a "DevOps Tool" or a "Compliance Dashboard". It is the world's first **Governed Agentic Platform**.

It answers the single most important question of the AI era:
**"How do we let autonomous agents do real work without losing control?"**

## The Evolution of Delivery

| Era | Focus | Mechanism | Bottleneck |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. DevOps** | Velocity | CI/CD Pipelines | Quality |
| **2. DevSecOps** | Security | Gates & Scanners | "The Gate" (Manual Review) |
| **3. Summit** | **Autonomy** | **The Agent Lattice** | **Trust** |

## The Inevitability Argument

1. **Agents are coming.** You cannot stop your developers from using AI. You can only govern it.
2. **Regulation is tightening.** GDPR, SOC2, and EU AI Act require *proof* of control, not just *intent*.
3. **Manual governance is dead.** Humans cannot review the volume of code that agents can generate.

**Conclusion:** The only viable future is one where **Governance is Code** and **Evidence is Automatic**.

## Why Summit Wins

* **We don't just log; we sign.** (Provenance Ledger)
* **We don't just block; we guide.** (Policy Engine)
* **We don't just run; we orchestrate.** (Agent Lattice)

Summit is the operating system for the high-trust, high-velocity enterprise.
