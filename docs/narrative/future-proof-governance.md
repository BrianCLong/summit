# Future-Proof Governance

## Breakthrough Concept

We do not know what AI regulations will look like in 2026, 2028, or 2030. Trying to hard-code compliance for future laws is futile.

Instead, Summit focuses on **Future-Proofing Evidence**.

### The Core Insight

Laws change. Facts do not.
If we capture the _facts_ of a decision with perfect fidelity—who, what, why, when, under what constraints—we can defend that decision under _any_ future legal regime.

## Narrative Framing

> _You cannot future-proof laws._
> _You can future-proof evidence._

This stance is profound and credible. It moves Summit out of the "Compliance Tool" category (which becomes obsolete) and into the "Institutional Memory" category (which gains value over time).

## Key Mechanism: The Immutable Ledger

Summit's **Provenance Ledger** is the cornerstone of this future-proofing.

- **Immutable:** Once written, history cannot be altered.
- **Context-Rich:** Stores not just the action, but the _logic_ and _policy_ active at that moment.
- **Re-evaluable:** We can take past decisions and "re-run" them against _new_ policies to see if they would still be compliant (simulating the impact of new regulations).

### Resilience to Regulatory Shift

When a new AI Act is passed:

1.  We translate the act into Summit Policies.
2.  We apply these policies to future actions.
3.  We use the Ledger to demonstrate that _past_ actions were reasonable _given the rules at the time_.

This provides **institutional continuity** in an era of regulatory volatility.
