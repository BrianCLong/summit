# Decentralized Control Without Chaos

## Breakthrough Concept

In complex systems, centralization creates bottlenecks, but total decentralization creates chaos. Summit solves this by allowing **Plural Authority**—multiple valid sources of truth and control—to coexist without conflict.

Summit allows:

- **Local Teams** to set tactical rules (e.g., "Deploy only on Tuesdays").
- **Central Governance** to set strategic boundaries (e.g., "Never deploy to embargoed regions").
- **External Regulators** to inject compliance mandates (e.g., "GDPR data retention").
- **Emergency Overrides** to bypass standard procedures during crises.

## Narrative Framing: "Plural Authority, Singular Truth"

How do these authorities coexist?
**Truth = Evidence + Policy + Outcome**

Summit does not rely on opinion or hierarchy. It relies on the **provenance ledger**.

- If a local rule conflicts with a global rule, the conflict is resolved deterministically by the **Arbitration Engine**.
- The _result_ of that resolution is recorded forever.

We replace "Command and Control" with **"Context and Constraint."**

## The Mechanism: Governance Composition

Summit composes policies like code.

1.  **Base Layer:** Constitutional Constraints (The "Do Not Harm" rules).
2.  **Layer 2:** Regulatory Mandates (The "Must Comply" rules).
3.  **Layer 3:** Organizational Strategy (The "Business Goals" rules).
4.  **Layer 4:** Team Tactics (The "Preference" rules).

An agent must satisfy the intersection of all active layers. If the intersection is empty (no legal move exists), the agent **halts and escalates**.

This guarantees that local autonomy never violates global safety.
