# Organizational Doctrine: The Summit Way

## Core Thesis

> _Most systems fail at scale because they assume aligned humans. Summit works at scale because it assumes misalignment—and structures around it._

## The 5 Pillars of Organizational Physics

### 1. Alignment Without Consensus

- **Principle:** We do not need to agree on every decision; we only need to agree on the boundaries.
- **Mechanism:** **Constraints** replace consensus.
- **Outcome:** High velocity with guaranteed safety.

### 2. Incentive-Neutral Governance

- **Principle:** Don't fight human nature. Align compliance with the path of least resistance.
- **Mechanism:** **Golden Paths** (easy compliance) and **Friction** (hard non-compliance).
- **Outcome:** Compliance becomes the default behavior, not a chore.

### 3. Conflict Containment

- **Principle:** Conflict is inevitable; toxicity is optional.
- **Mechanism:** **Policy as Code** turns political fights into technical engineering problems.
- **Outcome:** "Productive tension" rather than "organizational warfare."

### 4. Cultural Memory

- **Principle:** The organization should know what it knows, regardless of who works here today.
- **Mechanism:** **Executable Memory** (Decision Records, Regression Policies).
- **Outcome:** Institutional wisdom accumulates instead of leaking away.

### 5. Entropy Absorption

- **Principle:** The system must get calmer as the organization gets messier.
- **Mechanism:** **Normalization** of diverse inputs into a coherent core.
- **Outcome:** Infinite diversity at the edges, absolute consistency at the center.

## The High-Impact Narrative

**Summit does not require a strong culture. It produces one.**

We do not build software that hopes for the best. We build software that handles the worst—misalignment, conflict, entropy, and amnesia—and transmutes them into order.

This is **Cultural Scalability**. This is **Summit**.
