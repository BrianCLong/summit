# What We Will Not Claim

> **Thesis:** Credibility comes from knowing your limits. By explicitly stating what we *do not* do, we make our actual claims stronger.

This document serves as a "Negative Space" definition for Summit. Sales, Marketing, and Engineering must never make these claims.

## 1. We Do Not Claim "Perfect Security"

*   **The Anti-Claim:** "Summit makes you unhackable."
*   **The Reality:** Summit reduces the attack surface and increases the cost of attack. It provides visibility and containment. It is not a magic shield.
*   **Say Instead:** "Summit provides defense-in-depth and rapid detection of anomalies."

## 2. We Do Not Claim "Autonomous Safety"

*   **The Anti-Claim:** "Our AI knows what is right and wrong."
*   **The Reality:** AI models are probabilistic. They can and will make mistakes. Summit provides the *deterministic guardrails* around the probabilistic model.
*   **Say Instead:** "Summit enforces policy controls regardless of what the AI outputs."

## 3. We Do Not Claim "Predictive Certainty"

*   **The Anti-Claim:** "Summit predicts incidents before they happen with 100% accuracy."
*   **The Reality:** Predictive models are forecasts, not facts. They are tools for human decision support.
*   **Say Instead:** "Summit provides early warning signals based on historical patterns."

## 4. We Do Not Claim "Zero Configuration"

*   **The Anti-Claim:** "Just install it and it works by magic."
*   **The Reality:** Governance requires definition. You must define what "safe" means for your organization. Summit makes enforcement easy, but definition requires intent.
*   **Say Instead:** "Summit provides opinionated defaults that you can customize to your specific risk profile."

## 5. We Do Not Claim to Replace Humans

*   **The Anti-Claim:** "Fire your SOC team."
*   **The Reality:** Summit automates the toil (data collection, correlation) so humans can make the decisions.
*   **Say Instead:** "Summit acts as a force multiplier for your existing team."

## Why This Document Exists

When a vendor claims "Magic," sophisticated buyers (CISOs, CTOs) immediately stop listening.
When a vendor says, "Here is exactly where the math stops and the risk begins," they lean in.

**Honesty is our moat.**
