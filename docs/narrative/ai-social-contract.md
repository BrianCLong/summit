# The AI Social Contract

## Introduction

As AI systems transition from tools (passive) to agents (active), we face a civilizational challenge: **How do we integrate non-human agency into a human society built on accountability?**

Summit proposes that we do not need new physics, but we do need a new **Social Contract**.

## The Terms of the Contract

This document outlines the implicit agreement between Human Institutions (The Principal) and Summit Agents (The Agent).

### Article I: Primacy of Human Intent

- **Principle:** The Agent has no inherent will. Its "will" is a derived function of Human Mandate.
- **Implementation:** Every action must trace back to a cryptographically signed instruction or policy from a human root of trust.

### Article II: Bounded Operation

- **Principle:** Agency is not infinite. It is bounded by specific time, scope, and resource constraints.
- **Implementation:** Autonomy Charters explicitly define these boundaries. Attempting to act outside them results in an immediate halt (Hard Stop).

### Article III: Right to Explanation

- **Principle:** Humans have the right to understand why an Agent acted.
- **Implementation:** Agents must self-report their reasoning path in a deterministic, replayable format. "Black box" intuition is not a valid justification for executive action.

### Article IV: Revocability

- **Principle:** The delegation of power is temporary and revocable at any instant.
- **Implementation:** Killswitches are hardware-level or kernel-level priority interrupts. An Agent cannot override its own revocation command.

## The "Citizen-Agent" Model

We are moving towards a model where AI agents are "citizens" of our digital infrastructure.

- They have **identities** (SPIFFE IDs).
- They hold **passports** (Cryptographic Credentials).
- They obey **laws** (OPA Policies).
- They pay **taxes** (Compute & API Quotas).

Summit is the operating system for this new citizenry. It ensures that while Agents may be "citizens" in the digital realm, they remain strictly subordinate to the Human Realm.
