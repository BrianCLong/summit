# Summit Narrative Sprint: Cognitive Innovation

This directory contains the artifacts from the **Narrative / Psych / Cognitive Innovation Sprint**.
These documents reframe Summit not just as enterprise software, but as **infrastructure logic for an AI-mediated world**.

## Core Thesis

> *The danger of advanced AI is not intelligence. It is illegible power.*

Summit’s core innovation is **explainable authority**. We make power, agency, and automated decision-making legible to humans, institutions, and regulators.

## Artifacts

### 1. [Legible Authority](./legible-authority.md)
*   **Concept:** Decoupling capability from authorization.
*   **Key Idea:** "Power You Can Point To."
*   **Diagram:** [Authority Stack Diagram](./diagrams/authority-stack.svg)

### 2. [Bounded Autonomy](./bounded-autonomy.md)
*   **Concept:** Autonomy as a contract, not a property.
*   **Key Idea:** Autonomy is granted, scoped, and revocable.
*   **Key Artifact:** The Autonomy Charter.

### 3. [Regulator-Grade Explanations](./regulator-grade-explanations.md)
*   **Concept:** Explanations designed to survive hostile scrutiny.
*   **Key Idea:** "Explanations That Hold Up in Court."
*   **Key Artifact:** The Decision Replay Transcript.

### 4. [Plural Authority](./plural-authority.md)
*   **Concept:** Decentralized control without chaos.
*   **Key Idea:** Truth = Evidence + Policy + Outcome.

### 5. [Future-Proof Governance](./future-proof-governance.md)
*   **Concept:** Resilience to regulatory change.
*   **Key Idea:** "You cannot future-proof laws. You can future-proof evidence."

### 6. [The AI Social Contract](./ai-social-contract.md)
*   **Concept:** The philosophical agreement between human institutions and machine agents.
*   **Key Idea:** Integrating non-human agency into accountability structures.

## Usage

These documents form the **Narrative Endgame** for Summit. They should be used to:
1.  **Brief Regulators:** To demonstrate that Summit-managed AI is safe AI.
2.  **Align Teams:** To ensure all features support the goal of *Legibility*.
3.  **Position the Platform:** To distinguish Summit from mere "MLOps" tools.
