# Product Vision & Positioning

**Vision:** Become the default open intelligence graph for security, risk, and investigative analytics—delivering **trustworthy, explainable, and policy-bound automation**.

**Target users:** SOC analysts, threat hunters, investigative journalists, and Enterprise GRC/Platform teams.

**Positioning:**

- **Against graph DB vendors:** We ship the _analyst workflow_ with GenAI+Graph synergy, not just storage.
- **Against OSINT tools:** We provide persistent knowledge graphs, lineage/provenance, and policy‑guarded collaboration.
- **Against SIEM/observability stacks:** We bridge unstructured OSINT + structured telemetry via connectors and graph‑native reasoning.
- **Against Automation Platforms (ServiceNow/Temporal):** We provide the **universal trust layer** (policy + receipts) that makes automations auditable and safe across all tools.

**Three Pillars**

1. **Explainable GraphRAG** – retrieval grounded in graph topology + evidence provenance.
2. **Trustworthy Automation** – Policy-bound actions with signed provenance receipts and multi-tenant cost attribution.
3. **Zero‑Trust Collaboration** – ABAC + differential privacy (DP) to share insights with least privilege and verifiable evidence.
