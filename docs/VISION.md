# Product Vision & Positioning

**Vision:** Become the default open intelligence graph for security, risk, and investigative analytics—delivering **explainable, real‑time insights** without vendor lock‑in.

**Target users:** SOC analysts, threat hunters, investigative journalists, fraud teams.

**Positioning:**

- **Against graph DB vendors:** We ship the _analyst workflow_ with GenAI+Graph synergy, not just storage.
- **Against OSINT tools:** We provide persistent knowledge graphs, lineage/provenance, and policy‑guarded collaboration.
- **Against SIEM/observability stacks:** We bridge unstructured OSINT + structured telemetry via connectors and graph‑native reasoning.

**Three Pillars**

1. **Explainable GraphRAG** – retrieval grounded in graph topology + evidence provenance.
2. **Agentic Runbooks** – codified investigation flows that operate on entities/relationships with auditable steps.
3. **Zero‑Trust Collaboration** – ABAC + differential privacy (DP) to share insights with least privilege.

Next after that phase, the work shifts from “good ecosystem” to **governed, enterprise-grade platform** that lines up cleanly with IC OSINT strategies and emerging AI-agent governance patterns.[1][2][3]

## Summit: governance, tradecraft, partners

- Formalize OSINT tradecraft and doctrine
  - Explicitly map workflows, outputs, and UX to the IC OSINT Strategy focus areas: coordinated acquisition, integrated collection management, innovation, and workforce/tradecraft.[4][1]
  - Build training-style runs and documentation that look like next‑gen OSINT workforce material, not just tool docs.[5][1]

- Build partnership‑ready surfaces
  - Shape APIs, data formats, and sharing models so they can plug into IC, DoD, State, and allied OSINT strategies that emphasize shared tools/tradecraft and foreign/academic partnerships.[6][7][8]
  - Package a “partner kit” (API docs, sample data, demo scripts) that mirrors how these strategies describe working with industry and academia.[9][1]

## Maestro: governed multi‑agent backbone

- Implement agent governance and control
  - Add identity, granular authorization, monitoring, and sandboxing to agents and tools, reflecting 2025–2026 best practices for AI-agent security (RBAC/ABAC/PBAC, behavioral monitoring, isolation).[2][10]
  - Map Maestro controls to emerging AI governance frameworks (ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF) so you can talk compliance and risk in enterprise language.[11][2]

- Mature MCP / orchestration as enterprise layer
  - Position Maestro explicitly as an MCP-style server: API‑first, policy‑driven connector between agents and external systems, matching how enterprise orchestration layers are evolving.[12][13]
  - Provide patterns and tooling so organizations can classify, evaluate, and risk‑assess agents and workflows, matching contemporary guidance on agent governance and lifecycle.[3][13][12]

## Cross-cutting: readiness for real buyers

- Package for procurement and evaluation
  - Produce short, evaluable artifacts: threat models, governance model, integration diagrams, and test plans that mirror how agencies and large enterprises assess OSINT and AI-agent platforms.[14][9]
  - Ensure your demos, docs, and contracts all tell the same story: Summit as OSINT mission engine; Maestro as governed multi‑agent substrate under modern oversight expectations.[1][2]
