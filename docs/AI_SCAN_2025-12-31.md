Recent activity indicates a steady stream of commits and pull requests. However, there are some areas that require attention, such as error handling and testing. The codebase could benefit from additional documentation and adherence to best practices for maintainability.\n\n## Priority Issues\n1. Improve error handling in the `cmd/summit/main.go` file to prevent crashes and provide more informative error messages.\n2. Enhance testing coverage in the `internal/pkg` directory to ensure that all critical components are thoroughly tested.\n", "commit_message": "docs: AI repository scan 2025-12-24"}
