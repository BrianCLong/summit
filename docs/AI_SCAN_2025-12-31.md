Recent activity suggests a moderate level of development, with several commits and issues addressed in the past few weeks. However, there are some areas that require attention, including error handling and testing for certain commands.\n\n## Priority Issues\n1. Improve error handling for the `summit init` command to prevent crashes when invalid input is provided.\n2. Enhance testing for the `summit config` command to ensure correct functionality across different environments.\n", "commit_message": "docs: AI repository scan 2025-12-24"}
