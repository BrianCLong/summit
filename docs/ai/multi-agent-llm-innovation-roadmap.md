# Multi-Agent LLM Innovation Roadmap

## Executive Summary
- **Objective:** Establish a "dream team" multi-agent architecture that exceeds single-agent planning and execution performance for Summit's intelligence and orchestration workloads.
- **Approach:** Combine specialized reasoning, retrieval, and execution agents orchestrated through a composable framework (AutoGen, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, OpenAI Swarm) with native tool-use (ToolLLM) to deliver persistent, auditable automation.
- **Key Outcomes:** Faster scenario planning, resilient knowledge synthesis, and continuously improving operational playbooks powered by telemetry and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.

## Leading-Edge Insights

### Dream-Team Agent Archetypes
1. **Field Intelligence Collectors** – tuned for rapid open-source harvesting, entity resolution, and credibility scoring.
2. **Strategy Synthesizers** – operate over large, dynamic context windows to produce branching plans and risk-weighted options.
3. **Execution Pilots** – manage workflow state, invoke automation, and coordinate with human operators, escalating on anomalies.
4. **Red-Team Sentinels** – adversarial agents probing bias, failure modes, and safety boundaries to maintain trustworthiness.

The latest research shows multi-agent constellations outperform single agents on complex planning tasks when: (a) subtasks are explicitly scoped, (b) shared memory captures intermediate artifacts, and (c) arbitration logic can critique and revise downstream outputs.

### Orchestration Framework Snapshot
| Framework | Strengths | Gaps to Monitor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AutoGen (Microsoft)** | Rich conversation orchestration, human/AI teaming, built-in tool calling. | Python-first; limited TypeScript support without wrappers. |
| **LangGraph** | Graph-based control flow, deterministic state machines for agents. | Early ecosystem; requires custom observability instrumentation. |
| **LlamaIndex** | Retrieval-augmented agent graph, storage abstraction across vector DBs. | Opinionated doc loaders; license review for closed deployments. |
| **CrewAI** | Lightweight crew formation, role-based memory primitives. | Needs stronger governance hooks (audit trails, RBAC). |
| **OpenAI Swarm** | Minimal-latency spawning of task-specialized agents. | Currently preview-only; requires close tracking of API limits. |
| **Semantic Kernel** | Polyglot (C#, Python, JS) skills & planners, enterprise integration. | Planning still brittle without custom heuristics; requires guardrails for self-modifying plans. |

**Recommendation:** Prototype with AutoGen + LangGraph hybrid to blend conversational flexibility with deterministic execution, while maintaining a Semantic Kernel bridge for .NET services already in Summit's estate.

### ToolLLM as the Execution Fabric
- Treat ToolLLM as the "API marketplace" for agents. Create a curated registry of approved tools (data taps, ticketing, observability, CI/CD) exposed via standardized OpenAPI manifests.
- Leverage ToolLLM's decision flow to score tool invocations for cost, latency, and risk before execution.
- Capture full telemetry (input, output, error, execution duration) for each tool call to feed the provenance ledger and support compliance.

## Innovation Tracks

### 1. Adaptive Mission Planning
- Implement iterative plan refinement loops (e.g., AutoGen's group chat) with sentinel agents empowered to veto plans lacking risk coverage.
- Introduce Monte Carlo-style scenario generators to stress-test playbooks before execution.

### 2. Persistent Operational Memory
- Back agent memory with Summit's provenance ledger to guarantee traceable decision paths.
- Use LangGraph checkpoints for rewind/replay during incident response drills.

### 3. Human-AI Symbiosis
- Embed real-time human override endpoints within CrewAI role flows ("operator-in-the-loop" mode) for high-risk actions.
- Deploy narrative synthesis agents (LlamaIndex) to translate agent deliberations into executive briefings.

### 4. Governance & Safety
- Align with Summit's policy package by gating tool access through RBAC-aware wrappers inside ToolLLM.
- Continuously red-team using adversarial sentinel agents tuned to find prompt-injection vectors and data leakage risks.

## Build Phases & Milestones
1. **Foundation (Weeks 0-4):**
   - Stand up LangGraph orchestrator with two agents (collector, synthesizer) against a sandbox data set.
   - Integrate ToolLLM with three critical tools (intel ingestion API, Jira automation, observability query).
2. **Scale-Out (Weeks 5-10):**
   - Expand to full "dream team" (add pilot + sentinel agents) and wire AutoGen group conversations for planning.
   - Add telemetry streaming into provenance ledger, enabling replay and compliance review.
3. **Optimization (Weeks 11-16):**
   - Introduce OpenAI Swarm for burst task execution; evaluate cost savings vs. latency.
   - Layer Semantic Kernel planners to bridge to existing .NET automation.
4. **Continuous Innovation (16+ Weeks):**
   - Automate policy updates via CrewAI-run governance sprints.
   - Deploy tool marketplace review board with human + sentinel co-approval.

## Metrics of Success
- **Operational Velocity:** ≥30% reduction in mean time from mission request to actionable plan.
- **Decision Quality:** Human acceptance rate ≥90% with sentinel-flagged issues resolved within 24 hours.
- **Resilience:** Zero high-severity incidents stemming from agent mis-execution; sentinel catch rate ≥95% for injected faults.
- **Adoption:** At least five teams actively co-creating missions with the agent collective by end of Phase 2.

## Next Steps
1. Ratify the reference architecture with Security, Compliance, and Ops stakeholders.
2. Launch a cross-functional tiger team to build the Phase 1 prototype with weekly demos.
3. Define budget envelopes for ToolLLM marketplace expansion and Swarm burst capacity.
4. Document governance SOPs for agent onboarding, tool approval, and telemetry retention.

By pursuing this roadmap, Summit can operationalize a best-in-class multi-agent ecosystem that remains explainable, governable, and rapidly adaptable to emerging mission demands.
