## III. TARGET VECTOR
* **Sectors:** Hedge funds, private trading firms, SOF-linked financial warfare cells, dark liquidity syndicates.
* **Use Cases:**
    * Inducing volatility for high-yield intraday trades.
    * Tactical information ops with direct economic impact.
    * Asset shielding and misdirection during covert capital shifts.

---

## IV. PSYOPS-MARKET SYNC MECHANISM
* Correlational models between population sentiment manipulation and asset class responses.
* **Tactical feedback loop:** Info war triggers -> social/market shifts -> quant pattern recognition -> trade execution.

---

## V. THREAT LANDSCAPE & COUNTER-COMPETITION
* **Adversaries:** Sovereign AI traders (PRC, RF, Gulf actors), decentralized botnets, insider-algo hybrids.
* **Defensive Edge:**
    * Multi-layered narrative laundering.
    * Stochastic psyops fingerprint obfuscation.
    * Dynamic compliance mirroring.

---

## VI. TECHNICAL SPECIFIERS
* **Data Sources:** OSINT, dark web intercepts, high-speed news tickers, broker API flow.
* **Architecture:** Modular cloud-native with hardened nodes for ops-critical functions.
* **Latency Benchmark:** Sub-300ms feedback loop from content deployment to trade execution.

---

## VII. CONOPS
* **Phase I (Deploy):** Controlled pilot with sandboxed market actors.
* **Phase II (Exploit):** Scalable disinfo-to-market-influence operations.
* **Phase III (Consolidate):** Deep integration with partner trading platforms and sovereign funds.

---

## VIII. ASK
* **Capital:** $12M seed to build minimum viable battlefield-ready system.
* **Terms:** Equity + performance royalty + dual-use access for intel/mil ops.
* **ROI Horizon:** 3Y profitability, 5Y exit via private equity or direct acquisition by cyber or defense integrator.
