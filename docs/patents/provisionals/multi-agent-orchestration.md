## Title: SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LATTICE-BASED MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION WITH DYNAMIC CAPABILITY ROUTING

### Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to artificial intelligence, and more specifically to the coordination and orchestration of multiple autonomous software agents in a distributed computing environment.

### Background
Traditional multi-agent systems rely on static workflows or linear "chains" of command. These systems are brittle; if one agent fails or is overloaded, the entire pipeline stalls. Furthermore, they lack the ability to dynamically "recruit" the best agent for a specific sub-task based on real-time capability assessment.

### Summary of the Invention
The present invention provides a "Lattice Architecture" where agents exist as nodes in a dynamic graph. A central or distributed "Maestro" service continuously evaluates the "Capability State" of all available agents. When a task is introduced, it is decomposed into sub-tasks, which are then "auctioned" to the agent lattice. Agents bid on tasks based on their current load, specialized model access (e.g., GPT-4 vs. Claude), and past performance on similar tasks. This results in a self-healing, self-optimizing orchestration fabric.

### Detailed Description
1.  **Capability Registry**: A real-time database tracking the models, tools, and context windows available to each agent.
2.  **Task Decomposition Engine**: A neuro-symbolic component that breaks high-level objectives (e.g., "Analyze this threat") into atomic units of work (e.g., "Scrape URL," "Translate Text," "Check Graph").
3.  **The Auction Mechanism**: A logic module that matches atomic tasks to agents. It considers:
    *   **Cost**: Minimizing token spend.
    *   **Latency**: Minimizing turnaround time.
    *   **Accuracy**: Maximizing probability of success based on historical benchmarks.
4.  **The Lattice Protocol**: A communication protocol allowing agents to pass intermediate states and "partial thoughts" to one another without returning to the central controller, creating a peer-to-peer reasoning mesh.

### Claims (Draft)
1. A method for orchestrating autonomous agents comprising: receiving a high-level objective; decomposing said objective into a plurality of sub-tasks; broadcasting said sub-tasks to a lattice of available agents; receiving bids from agents indicating capability and cost; and assigning tasks to optimal agents.
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein the "bid" includes a confidence score generated by the agent's underlying Large Language Model.
3. The system of Claim 1, further comprising a "reputation score" for each agent that updates based on the verified accuracy of completed tasks.
