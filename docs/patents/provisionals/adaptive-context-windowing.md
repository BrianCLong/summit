# Provisional Patent Application
## Title: SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ADAPTIVE CONTEXT WINDOW MANAGEMENT IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

### Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and resource management in cloud computing, specifically to optimizing the "context window" (short-term memory) of Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Background
LLMs have a fixed limit on the amount of text they can process (the "context window"). As a conversation or analysis session grows, this window fills up. Naive solutions simply truncate the oldest text, leading to a loss of critical prior instructions or facts ("Catastrophic Forgetting").

### Summary of the Invention
The present invention provides an "Adaptive Context Manager" that dynamically compresses, summarizes, and prioritizes information within the context window. Instead of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) truncation, it uses a "Semantic Relevance Score" derived from the current user query to decide what to keep, what to compress, and what to discard.

### Detailed Description
1.  **Token Counting Service**: A precise metering engine that tracks usage against provider-specific limits.
2.  **Semantic Scoring**: When the window approaches capacity, the system scores every previous message block based on its semantic similarity to the *current* active goal.
3.  **Tiered Compression Strategy**:
    *   **Tier 1 (High Relevance)**: Kept raw (verbatim).
    *   **Tier 2 (Medium Relevance)**: Replaced with a dense summary generated by a smaller, cheaper model.
    *   **Tier 3 (Low Relevance)**: Offloaded to long-term storage (Vector DB) and replaced with a retrieval pointer.
4.  **Billing Optimization**: The system also swaps models (e.g., GPT-4 to GPT-3.5) for the summarization tasks to minimize cost.

### Claims (Draft)
1. A method for managing the context window of a language model comprising: monitoring token usage; triggering a compression event when a threshold is reached; calculating a relevance score for each historical message segment relative to a current objective; and applying a differential compression strategy based on said score.
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein "Low Relevance" segments are evicted to an external vector database and replaced with a semantic pointer.
