# Analyst Q&A Playbook

## Q1: “How is this different from X?”

**Answer:** Summit is positioned in the Governed Intelligence Operations category. The differentiation is **enforcement of guarantees**—policy gates, evidence linkage, and lifecycle discipline—rather than feature breadth. We intentionally avoid competing on speed alone; our focus is governed velocity.

**Evidence references to provide on request:**

- Policy gate definitions and promotion criteria
- Provenance/evidence linkage samples
- Lifecycle stage checklists

## Q2: “When will you become autonomous?”

**Answer:** Autonomy is explicitly bounded. Summit does not claim autonomous decision authority. Any expansion of autonomy is gated by evidence thresholds and governance requirements, and would be communicated only after those thresholds are met.

**Evidence references to provide on request:**

- Autonomy boundary definitions
- Governance policies on authority delegation

---

## Q3: “What proof do you have?”

**Answer:** We provide traceable evidence for each claim: policy-as-code gates, decision logs, and provenance trails. We do not advance claims without evidence artifacts that analysts can review.

**Evidence references to provide on request:**

- Audit logs and provenance trails
- Documented governance criteria
- Measured outcomes from validated environments

---

## Q4: “What risks remain?”

**Answer:** The primary risks are governance drift, evidence gaps, and premature autonomy claims. Summit mitigates these by enforcing policy gates, requiring evidence thresholds, and maintaining explicit autonomy boundaries. We track these as operational risks, not marketing constraints.

**Evidence references to provide on request:**

- Risk register entries
- Governance drift monitoring criteria
- Corrective action examples

---

## Q5: “How should we evaluate progress over time?”

**Answer:** Track evidence density per capability, audit completeness, and consistency of lifecycle graduation. Progress is validated when claims are supported by published evidence and verified governance gates.

**Evidence references to provide on request:**

- Graduation criteria updates
- Evidence artifacts linked to each claim
- Audit completeness metrics
