# Analyst Claims Guardrail Sheet

## Purpose

Translate internal claims discipline into analyst-safe language. Prevents overclaiming and speculative framing.

---

## Allowed Language (Current, Evidence-Bound)

- “Policy-enforced governance gates.”
- “Evidence-linked decision trails.”
- “Graduated lifecycle for capability promotion.”
- “Risk-aware delivery with reversible workflows.”
- “Auditable provenance of outputs and decisions.”

**Usage rule:** Each statement must map to present evidence, not intent or roadmap.

---

## Conditional Language (Only With Evidence in Hand)

- “Validated in controlled production environments.”
- “Meets defined governance thresholds for promotion.”
- “Demonstrated rollback and correction pathways.”
- “Independent verification of audit completeness.”

**Usage rule:** Only if corresponding evidence artifacts can be produced on request.

---

## Forbidden Language (Overclaiming / Speculative)

- “Fully autonomous.”
- “Self-governing intelligence.”
- “No human oversight required.”
- “Guaranteed accuracy.”
- “Industry-leading” (without third-party evidence).

---

## Analyst-Quotable Examples (Safe)

- “Summit prioritizes governed velocity over raw automation.”
- “Summit ties every decision to evidence and policy gates.”
- “Summit’s claims advance only when evidence thresholds are met.”

---

## Phrases to Avoid (Misleading)

- “Real-time omniscience.”
- “Fully automated outcomes.”
- “Autonomous command and control.”
- “AI that replaces analysts.”

## Guardrail Checklist Before Publishing

1. Does the statement describe **current** capability only?
2. Is there an **evidence artifact** available to validate it?
3. Does it avoid authority or autonomy escalation?
4. Is it framed in terms of **enforced guarantees**, not marketing claims?
