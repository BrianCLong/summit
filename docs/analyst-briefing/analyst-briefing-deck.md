# Summit Analyst Briefing Deck (Narrative-First)

## Slide 0 — Title

**Summit: Governed Intelligence Operations Platform**
**Purpose:** Category education + evaluation discipline (not a launch narrative).

---

## Slide 1 — Market Problem (Pattern-Level)

**Structural risks in current approaches**

- Speed without governance amplifies error propagation, audit gaps, and brittle trust chains.
- Governance without velocity stalls operations, turning compliance into operational debt.
- Existing systems separate analysis, action, and evidence, creating drift between decisions and facts.

**Result:** Enterprises face a credibility deficit under time pressure.

---

## Slide 2 — Why the “Speed vs Governance” Binary Fails

- **Speed-only stacks** optimize for throughput but lack durable proof of correctness.
- **Governance-only stacks** optimize for controls but create slow, manual workflows.
- Summit targets the missing middle: **governed velocity**—progress that is provable, reversible, and evidence-bound.

---

## Slide 3 — Category Definition (New + Adjacent)

**Summit defines:** **Governed Intelligence Operations Platforms**

**Adjacent categories it overlaps with**

- AI analytics platforms
- Graph intelligence/knowledge systems
- Case management and investigative tooling
- Trust, risk, and compliance (TRC) systems

**Why existing labels are insufficient**

- Traditional categories either over-index on automation or on compliance.
- Summit is defined by **enforced guarantees**, not only features.

---

## Slide 4 — Category Boundaries (What Is In/Out)

**In-scope**

- Evidence-anchored analysis flows
- Policy-as-code enforcement on decisions
- Graduated lifecycle stages with explicit proofs
- Risk-aware orchestration and auditability

**Out-of-scope**

- Autonomous decisioning without human accountability
- Black-box outputs without evidence lineage
- “Set-and-forget” automation that bypasses governance

---

## Slide 5 — Product Architecture (Guarantee-Oriented)

**Summit guarantees are enforced by design:**

- **Truthfulness:** claims must trace to evidence and provenance, not claims of intent.
- **Graduation discipline:** capabilities advance only when evidence thresholds are met.
- **Risk-aware delivery:** operational pathways degrade gracefully under uncertainty.

**Analyst takeaway:** Summit is measured by **enforcement mechanisms**, not feature lists.

---

## Slide 6 — Enforcement Mechanisms (How Guarantees Hold)

- **Policy-as-code gates:** explicit conditions control what can be promoted or claimed.
- **Provenance ledgering:** evidence and decisions are linked and auditable.
- **Lifecycle stages:** prototype → controlled use → validated → production-ready.
- **Explicit rollback and reversibility:** changed claims require proof.

---

## Slide 7 — What Summit Will Not Do (Trust-Building)

- Claim autonomous authority over operational decisions.
- Present future capability as current capability.
- Bypass governance to hit velocity metrics.
- Replace human accountability in high-consequence workflows.

---

## Slide 8 — Evaluation Framework (How to Assess Fairly)

**Maturity signals to watch**

- Evidence density per capability (proof per claim)
- Demonstrated rollback or correction workflows
- Audit trail completeness and clarity
- Lifecycle graduation criteria consistency

**Evidence analysts should expect**

- Published policy gates and criteria
- Documented decision logs and change records
- Measured performance under stress scenarios

---

## Slide 9 — Signals of Risk or Drift

- Capability claims exceed documented evidence.
- Governance bypasses for “performance reasons.”
- Expansion of autonomy without stated boundaries or proof.
- Declining audit completeness or provenance gaps.

---

## Slide 10 — Signals of Category Leadership

- Consistent policy-as-code governance at scale.
- Evidence-based graduation with independent verification.
- Demonstrated trust restoration under incident response.
- Adoption by high-scrutiny stakeholders without narrative inflation.

---

## Slide 11 — Language Guardrails (Analyst-Safe)

**Use**: “Evidence-anchored,” “policy-enforced,” “graduated lifecycle.”

**Avoid**: “Autonomous,” “self-governing,” “fully automated decisions.”

**Rule:** Claims must map to currently evidenced capabilities.

---

## Slide 12 — Visuals (Minimal Set)

1. **Category map** with boundaries and exclusions.
2. **Lifecycle & graduation flow** from prototype to production.
3. **Risk vs velocity positioning** (governed velocity quadrant).

---

## Slide 13 — Analyst Q&A Preview

- “How is this different from X?” → category boundaries + guarantee enforcement.
- “When will you become autonomous?” → autonomy boundaries + evidence gating.
- “What proof do you have?” → provenance logs + policy gates + measured outcomes.
- “What risks remain?” → explicit, documented risks with mitigation plans.

---

## Slide 14 — Closing Principle

**Summit is evaluated by its discipline, not its hype.**
If analysts repeat this narrative, Summit is better understood—not merely explained.
