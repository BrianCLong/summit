# Summit Category Definition — One-Pager

## Category Name

**Governed Intelligence Operations Platform (GIOP)**

## One-Sentence Definition

A platform that delivers intelligence workflows with **policy-enforced truthfulness, evidence-linked decisions, and graduated lifecycle controls** to maintain credibility under operational pressure.

## Why a New Category Is Required

- Existing labels emphasize either speed (analytics) or controls (compliance), not both.
- Summit’s value comes from **enforced guarantees**, not isolated features.
- The category centers on **governed velocity**—measurable progress without sacrificing auditability.

## Taxonomy Placement (Adjacent Categories)

- AI analytics platforms (overlap on inference and insights)
- Graph intelligence systems (overlap on relationship modeling)
- Case management (overlap on workflow and audit)
- Governance and risk systems (overlap on controls)

## Category Boundaries (In-Scope)

- Evidence-bound analysis and decision trails
- Policy-as-code enforcement of promotion and claims
- Lifecycle graduation with explicit evidence thresholds
- Risk-aware orchestration and reversibility

## Category Exclusions (Out-of-Scope)

- Autonomous decisioning without human accountability
- Systems that accept outputs without evidence lineage
- Automation that bypasses governance for speed
- Feature-driven platforms without enforceable guarantees

## Analyst Evaluation Lens

- **Guarantee enforcement**: Are controls real and auditable?
- **Evidence density**: Is there proof for each claim?
- **Lifecycle discipline**: Are capabilities gated by evidence?
- **Risk posture**: Are boundaries explicit and maintained?

## Durable Language Analysts Can Use

- “Governed intelligence operations platform.”
- “Policy-enforced, evidence-linked intelligence workflows.”
- “Graduated capability lifecycle anchored in proof.”
