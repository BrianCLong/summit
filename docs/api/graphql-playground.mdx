import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

The GraphQL API underpins ingestion, analysis, and automation flows across IntelGraph. This playground embeds a secure
[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) console so you can try live queries with the same headers your automations use.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Bring your own token">
  Generate a short-lived JWT with the `analyst` or `orchestrator` roles before issuing requests. The
  {@link developer/getting-started#jwt-configuration developer/getting-started guide} walks through setting up the
  authentication service locally, and production tenants can use the `/auth/token` OAuth client credentials flow.
</Admonition>

## Example workflows

The buttons above the playground load the following reference queries and mutations so you can tailor them to your data sets.
Each snippet assumes a JWT scoped to a tenant and pipeline with permission to mutate graph content.

### Ingest a new entity and relationship

```graphql title="Upsert a lead and link it to a case"
mutation UpsertIntelCase($entity: EntityInput!, $relationship: RelationshipInput!) {
  upsertEntity(input: $entity) {
    id
    type
    confidence
    props
  }
  upsertRelationship(input: $relationship) {
    kind
    src
    dst
    confidence
  }
}
```

```json title="Variables"
{
  "entity": {
    "id": "lead-4739",
    "type": "Lead",
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "props": {
      "summary": "Wiki-leak mention correlates with suspicious wallet activity",
      "source": "osint://intel-drop-2024-09-13"
    }
  },
  "relationship": {
    "src": "case-41",
    "dst": "lead-4739",
    "kind": "MENTIONS",
    "confidence": 0.72,
    "props": {
      "ingestedAt": "2024-09-13T14:43:00Z",
      "ingestPipeline": "summit-agent-osint"
    }
  }
}
```

### Explore the surrounding graph

```graphql title="Request a neighborhood"
query AnalystNeighborhood($id: ID!, $depth: Int = 2) {
  neighbors(id: $id, depth: $depth) {
    nodes {
      id
      type
      confidence
    }
    rels {
      src
      dst
      kind
      confidence
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Variables"
{
  "id": "lead-4739",
  "depth": 2
}
```

### Explain a judgement with paths

```graphql title="Trace paths between entities"
query InvestigatePath($source: ID!, $target: ID!, $maxDepth: Int = 4) {
  paths(src: $source, dst: $target, maxDepth: $maxDepth) {
    nodes {
      id
      type
    }
    rels {
      src
      dst
      kind
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Variables"
{
  "source": "lead-4739",
  "target": "account-102",
  "maxDepth": 3
}
```

## Securing your requests

- **Authorization header** – Paste a JWT or full `Bearer ...` header; the playground automatically prefixes plain tokens
  with `Bearer` for you.
- **Local storage opt-in** – Tokens are _not_ persisted unless you check **Remember token in this browser**.
- **CORS & CSRF** – Requests run from your browser to the endpoint you provide. Ensure CORS allows the docs origin when
  targeting staging or production and prefer HTTPS to avoid leaking credentials.

Once you have a valid token, you can reuse the loaded examples or write ad-hoc GraphQL operations to automate ingestion
pipelines, runbook orchestration, or graph analytics against the Summit APIs.
