# Securiteyes Deception & Canaries

Securiteyes supports defensive deception to identify attackers who have bypassed outer defenses.

## Deception Assets

Deception assets are "fake" resources that should never be touched by legitimate users.

*   **Honeytokens**: API keys that trigger an alert when used.
*   **Decoy Data**: Database records that appear valuable but are fake.

## Detection Logic

Access to a deception asset is detected via:

1.  **Ingestion**: Telemetry signals with `type: 'deception_access'` (generated by the asset itself or the gateway).
2.  **Detection Rule**: The `DECEPTION_TRIGGER` rule in `DetectionEngine` flags these events as **Critical** severity.
3.  **Response**: Immediate creation of a `SuspiciousEvent` linked to the asset via `TRIGGERED_BY`.

## Managing Assets

Use the `POST /deception-assets` endpoint to register new assets in the graph.
