### Proposal: 90-Day Decision Governance Pilot

**Problem**
Our highest-risk incidents are not caused by missing tools, but by rushed, poorly evidenced decisions made under pressure—followed by painful audits and executive escalations.

**What We Are Piloting**
A narrowly scoped system that governs _decisions_, not people or tools:

- Enforces evidence before action
- Allows refusal and non-action safely
- Produces audit-ready decision records automatically

**What This Is Not**

- Not a tool replacement
- Not autonomous automation
- Not a dashboard

**Why This Matters**

- Reduces incident severity
- Lowers audit and compliance burden
- Protects operators and leadership
- Improves decision consistency under pressure

**Pilot Scope**

- 3–5 high-risk decision types
- 90 days
- No scope expansion

**Success Looks Like**

- Fewer escalations
- Higher evidence quality
- Faster audits
- Executive confidence to mandate expansion

**Ask**
Approval to run a 90-day pilot with:

- Named executive sponsor
- Authority to block unsafe decisions
- Commitment to review expansion at Day 90
