### Pilot Name

**Summit Decision Governance Pilot**

### Duration

90 calendar days

### Purpose

Demonstrate that Summit measurably reduces **decision risk, incident cost, and audit friction** in high-stakes operational environments by governing decisions—not tools or people.

### Scope (Non-Negotiable)

* Applies only to **explicitly enumerated decisions**
* Does **not** replace existing tools
* Does **not** automate actions without authorization
* Does **not** expand scope during pilot

### Authority Model

* Decision ownership remains with designated human roles
* Summit may **approve, refuse, or defer**
* Overrides require justification and are logged

### Success Definition

The pilot is successful **only if** it produces:

* Fewer high-risk decisions
* Higher evidence quality
* Reduced escalation and audit burden
* Executive confidence sufficient to mandate expansion
