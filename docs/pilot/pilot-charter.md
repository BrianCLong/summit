# Pilot Charter: 90-Day Trust Accrual Pilot (Security & Governance Beachhead)

## Pilot Objective (Non-Negotiable)

Within 90 days, the pilot must:
1. **Reduce real decision risk** (not simulate it)
2. **Produce audit-grade evidence**
3. **Change executive behavior** (fewer escalations, more trust)
4. **Create irreversible internal dependence**

If any of these are missing, the pilot failed—even if the software “worked.”

## Pilot Entry Point: Security Incident Governance (SOC / SecOps)

**Why:**
* Decisions are already high-stakes
* Automation exists but is distrusted
* Auditors and execs already care
* ROI shows up fastest

**Do not pilot:**
* General automation
* Dashboards
* ML workflows
* Productivity tooling

This pilot succeeds by **saying “no” well**, not by doing more.

## Pilot Architecture (Minimal, Real)

```
Signals (existing tools)
   ↓
Summit Decision Gate
   ↓
Approved / Refused / Deferred
   ↓
Evidence + Decision Memory
   ↓
Post-Incident Replay
```

No tool replacement. No data migration. No platform re-architecture.
Summit sits **between intent and action**.

## 90-Day Timeline

### Phase 1 — Trust Setup (Days 1–14)
* **Objective:** Establish legitimacy, define authority boundaries, make refusal safe.
* **Deliverables:** Decision Charter (signed), Evidence Schema, Refusal Playbook.
* **Success Signal:** Operators are *relieved*, not threatened.

### Phase 2 — Shadow Mode (Days 15–30)
* **Objective:** Observe without blocking, build decision memory.
* **Deliverables:** Shadow Decision Report, Confidence Gap Analysis.
* **Success Signal:** Humans start asking Summit *before* acting.

### Phase 3 — Soft Gating (Days 31–60)
* **Objective:** Begin real control, block only the worst decisions.
* **Deliverables:** Blocked Decision Records, Override Justification Log.
* **Success Signal:** Fewer bad decisions, fewer escalations.

### Phase 4 — Hard Proof (Days 61–90)
* **Objective:** Demonstrate irreversible value, secure expansion mandate.
* **Deliverables:** Pilot Evidence Pack, Executive Summary, Expansion Proposal.
* **Success Signal:** Executives ask: “Why isn’t this everywhere?”

## Pilot Metrics

### Operational
* Decision latency ↓
* Escalation count ↓
* Incident severity ↓
* Human hours saved ↓

### Cognitive
* Operator confidence ↑
* Decision reversals ↓
* Postmortem blame ↓

### Governance
* Evidence completeness ↑
* Audit prep time ↓
* Override justification quality ↑

### Economic
* Incident cost avoided
* Compliance hours avoided
* Consulting spend reduced

**No vanity metrics. No adoption dashboards.**

## Anti-Failure Rules
* ❌ Do not overscope
* ❌ Do not promise autonomy
* ❌ Do not bypass refusal paths
* ❌ Do not hide blocked actions
* ❌ Do not sell during the pilot

**Trust first. Expansion later.**

## Conversion Strategy
End of Day 90 Must Include:
1. **Named executive sponsor**
2. **Written expansion mandate**
3. **Budget line item**
4. **Policy reference in governance docs**
