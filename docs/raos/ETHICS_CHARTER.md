# Clean-Hands Policy & Ethics Charter

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Owner:** Ethics & Clean-Hands Review Board
**Enforcement:** Absolute Veto Power

## 1. Core Mandate

This organization fundamentally rejects the practice of regulatory capture. We believe that **sustainable competitive advantage comes from technical superiority and ethical antifragility**, not from political manipulation.

## 2. The "Clean-Hands" Doctrine

We will operate in a manner that is:

1.  **Lawful:** Adhering to the letter and spirit of all regulations.
2.  **Transparent:** Willing to open our books, models, and processes to scrutiny.
3.  **Independent:** Never relying on regulatory favors to survive.

## 3. Forbidden Actions (Red Lines)

The following actions are strictly prohibited, regardless of potential ROI:

- **Quid-Pro-Quo:** Exchanging value for specific regulatory outcomes.
- **Shadow Drafting:** Writing legislation in secret for regulators to copy-paste.
- **Revolving Doors:** Hiring regulators for the explicit purpose of immediate access (cooling-off periods apply).
- **Obfuscation:** Intentionally designing systems to hide risk or non-compliance.
- **Frivolous Petitioning:** Using regulatory processes solely to impose costs on competitors without valid grievance.

## 4. Operational Ethics

### 4.1. Interaction with Regulators

- All interactions must be documented.
- We provide **education** and **technical context**, not "lobbying" in the transactional sense.
- We advocate for **standards**, not **companies**.

### 4.2. Response to Competitor Malfeasance

- We do not engage in "tit-for-tat" capture.
- We respond to unfair environments by **increasing transparency** and demonstrating the viability of higher standards.

## 5. The Review Board

- **Composition:** Legal, Engineering, Policy, and External Ethics Advisor.
- **Authority:** The Board has **unilateral veto power** over any strategic initiative deemed to violate this Charter.
- **Audit:** The Board conducts quarterly "Clean-Hands Audits" to verify adherence.

## 6. Whistleblowing

Any employee who suspects a violation of this Charter is mandated to report it.

- **Protection:** Absolute non-retaliation.
- **Channel:** Direct encrypted channel to the Board.
