# Competitor Capture Risk Modeling Framework

**Purpose:** To quantify the strategic exposure of competitors due to their reliance on regulatory capture.

**Concept:** Capture is a form of **Technical Debt** and **Strategic Fragility**.

---

## 1. The Risk Dimensions

We score competitors on a 1-5 scale across these axes:

### A. Regulatory Dependency (The "Life Support" Score)

- _How much of their margin is protected by specific, favorable rules?_
- **High Risk:** Business model collapses if Rule X changes.
- **Low Risk:** Business model is robust to deregulation.

### B. Compliance Rigidity (The "Cement" Score)

- _How hardcoded is their compliance?_
- **High Risk:** Requires 6+ months to adapt to a minor rule change.
- **Low Risk:** Adaptable software-defined compliance.

### C. Political Exposure (The "Headline" Risk)

- _How visible is their influence peddling?_
- **High Risk:** Constant lobbying scandals, "revolving door" hires.
- **Low Risk:** Technical engagement only.

### D. Audit Gap (The "Black Box" Score)

- _How much do they hide?_
- **High Risk:** "Trust us," opaque algorithms, resistant to data access.
- **Low Risk:** Transparent, verifiable.

## 2. The "Capture Fragility Index" (CFI)

`CFI = (Dependency * 2) + Rigidity + Exposure + Audit Gap`

- **Score > 20:** Critically Fragile. (Target for disruption via transparency).
- **Score 10-20:** Vulnerable.
- **Score < 10:** Resilient.

## 3. Scenario Modeling

For each High-CFI Competitor, run scenarios:

- **Scenario A: The "Sudden Transparency" Shock.**
  - _What if a regulator mandates API access to their data?_
  - _Our Move:_ Have the API client ready day one.

- **Scenario B: The "Algorithmic Accountability" Act.**
  - _What if they must explain their ranking/pricing?_
  - _Our Move:_ Publish our open audit framework.

- **Scenario C: The "Lobbying Ban".**
  - _What if their political access is cut off?_
  - _Our Move:_ Rely on our "Standards Supremacy".

## 4. Quarterly Review

The RAF updates the CFI for top 5 competitors quarterly.

- _Output:_ "Attack Surface Map" identifying where regulation has made them slow/stupid.
