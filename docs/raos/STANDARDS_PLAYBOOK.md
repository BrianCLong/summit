# Standards Participation Playbook

**Objective:** To lead the industry by defining the technical standards that regulations will eventually enforce.

**Principle:** **"He who writes the standard, wins the regulation."**

---

## Phase 1: Identification & Selection

Do not participate in every standards body. Select only those that:

1.  **Define Architecture:** Where the standard dictates the data model or interface.
2.  **Lack Dominance:** Where the incumbent is absent, lazy, or defensive.
3.  **Align with "Clean-Hands":** Where transparency and auditability are core values.

**Criteria:**

- Is it open?
- Is it technically rigorous?
- Does it favor modern, cloud-native architectures?

## Phase 2: The "Reference Implementation" Tactic

Regulators and standards bodies often produce dry text.
**We produce working code.**

1.  **Build the Spec:** Implement the draft standard in our platform immediately.
2.  **Open Source It:** Release a lightweight, verifiable implementation / SDK.
3.  **Demo It:** Show regulators _working software_ instead of slide decks.

**Outcome:** The discussion shifts from "Is this rule feasible?" to "Why can't the incumbents do what _they_ are doing?"

## Phase 3: "Trojan Horse" rigorousness

Embed requirements in the standard that are:

- **Trivial for us:** (e.g., Cryptographic provenance, real-time API access).
- **Hard for them:** (e.g., Unwinding legacy batch processes, exposing monolithic internals).

**Tactics:**

- Advocate for "Real-time" over "Daily".
- Advocate for "API-first" over "PDF reports".
- Advocate for "Granular Consent" over "Blanket Terms".

## Phase 4: Coalition Building

- Partner with **Academia:** They validate the rigor.
- Partner with **NGOs:** They validate the ethics.
- Partner with **Startups:** We are the "champion of the little guy" against the walled gardens.

## Phase 5: Withdrawal

If a standard becomes captured or watered down:

1.  **Dissent Publicly:** Publish a "Minority Report" explaining why the standard fails the consumer.
2.  **Fork:** Establish a "High-Assurance" superset of the standard.
3.  **Market the Gap:** "We meet the standard, plus the _Real_ requirements."
