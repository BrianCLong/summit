# Internal “Red Lines” & Escalation SOP

**Purpose:** To prevent "accidental capture" and ensure strict adherence to the Clean-Hands Doctrine.

---

## 1. The Red Lines (Absolute Prohibitions)

If ANY of the following are observed or proposed, the **Stop-Work Authority** is immediately invoked.

1.  **Direct Drafting:** Writing specific legislative text for a regulator to introduce as their own.
2.  **Quid Pro Quo:** Offering anything of value (jobs, donations, data access) in explicit exchange for a policy outcome.
3.  **The "Competitor Tax":** Advocating for a rule _solely_ to harm a competitor, with no consumer benefit.
4.  **Data Trading:** Providing user data to government agencies outside of valid legal process (warrant/subpoena) to curry favor.
5.  **Revolving Door:** Discussing employment with a sitting regulator who has jurisdiction over us.

## 2. Detection Mechanisms

- **Interaction Logging:** Every meeting with a government official must be logged within 24 hours.
- **Keyword Scanning:** Internal communications monitored for high-risk terms ("bribe", "deal", "fix", "loophole").
- **Whistleblower Hotline:** Anonymous, encrypted channel directly to the Ethics Board.

## 3. Escalation Procedure

### Level 1: Potential Grey Area

- _Trigger:_ Employee unsure if a proposed action (e.g., hosting a dinner) is allowed.
- _Action:_ Submit "Ethics Review Request" to RAF.
- _Response:_ Written guidance within 48 hours.

### Level 2: Observed Violation (Minor)

- _Trigger:_ Failure to log a meeting, inadvertent "advocacy" language.
- _Action:_ Immediate report to Legal/Compliance.
- _Response:_ Investigation, retraining, corrective record filing.

### Level 3: Critical Red Line Breach

- _Trigger:_ Evidence of bribery, shadow drafting, or explicit capture seeking.
- _Action:_ **Flash Alert** to Ethics Board.
- _Containment:_ Immediate suspension of involved personnel.
- _Disclosure:_ Board decides on self-reporting to authorities (Bias towards disclosure).

## 4. The "Stop-Work" Authority

Any engineer, product manager, or policy staffer has the right to **halt a project** if they believe it necessitates breaking a Red Line to succeed.

- _Slogan:_ **"Better to lose the contract than lose our hands."**
