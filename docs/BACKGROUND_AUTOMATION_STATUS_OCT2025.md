## 4. One-Pass Delivery Orchestrator (‚ö†Ô∏è Failed - Expected)

**Process**: `run_one_pass.sh`
**Target**: Complete October 2025 delivery closure

### Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed at de-duplication step (expected)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è De-duplication requires manual review CSV editing
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Not critical - October Master Plan already 100% complete

### Failure Details
```
STEP 1: De-duplicate Project #8 (detect ‚Üí review ‚Üí dry-run ‚Üí apply)
- Detected 66 duplicate groups (196 duplicate items)
- Generated review CSV: artifacts/duplicates_review.csv
- Dry-run failed: CSV requires manual KEEP/REMOVE decisions
- Rollback criteria not met (expected behavior)
```

### Resolution Required
1. Edit `artifacts/duplicates_review.csv`
2. Set `keep_action=KEEP` for one item per group
3. Set `keep_action=REMOVE` for duplicates
4. Re-run de-duplication script

**Note**: This is expected behavior - manual review prevents accidental deletions
