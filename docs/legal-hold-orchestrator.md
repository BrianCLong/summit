# Legal Hold Orchestrator

## Overview
The Legal Hold Orchestrator coordinates end-to-end preservation workflows across distributed
storage systems. It standardizes how legal teams initiate, monitor, and release holds while
meeting regulatory, e-discovery, and chain-of-custody requirements. The orchestrator:

- Applies preservation actions across heterogeneous connectors (cloud archives, SaaS platforms,
  on-prem systems) with verification and reporting hooks.
- Automates custodian notification campaigns, acknowledgement tracking, and escalation paths.
- Integrates with lifecycle and retention policies to suspend automated deletion while a hold is
  active.
- Produces comprehensive audit trails and chain-of-custody events to support defensible discovery
  and regulatory inspections.
- Generates e-discovery export packages that align with matter requirements and downstream review
  tooling.

## Core Capabilities
| Capability | Description | Controls / Outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Preservation orchestration** | Fan-out preservation requests to registered connectors, capture
discrete reference IDs, and verify applied retention locks. | Ensures preservation consistency
across AWS S3, Microsoft 365, GSuite, and other connectors. Verification logs document proof of
lock status for audits. |
| **Custodian lifecycle** | Issue notifications using existing NotificationService templates,
track acknowledgement state, and escalate outstanding custodians through compliance checks. |
Delivers auditable proof of custodian outreach and participation, satisfying FRCP 37(e) and ISO
27050 guidance. |
| **Compliance monitoring** | Scheduled checkpoints review custodian acknowledgements, connector
health, and policy suspensions. Results feed into Prometheus metrics and audit logs. |
Provides defensible evidence for SOC 2 CC7.4 (logging), ISO 27001 A.12.4.1 (event logging), and
eDiscovery readiness metrics. |
| **Lifecycle policy integration** | Automatically suspends retention policies tied to targeted
data sets and synthesizes overrides when no formal policy exists. |
Prevents inadvertent deletion (FRCP 37(e)) and documents policy interactions for regulators. |
| **Chain-of-custody logging** | Emits signed custody events (leveraging Ed25519 support) for each
major action—initiation, verification, release—ensuring tamper-evident provenance. |
Supports evidence admissibility, aligning with NIST 800-86 and DOJ e-discovery guidance. |
| **E-discovery exports** | Coordinates export jobs across connectors, capturing export paths,
formats, and counts for ingestion into review platforms. |
Delivers repeatable collections for FRCP production obligations and analytics. |

## Workflow Summary
1. **Initiation**
   - Legal ops defines custodians, scope, and matter metadata.
   - Orchestrator registers the hold, suspends lifecycle policies, and emits custody/audit events.
2. **Notification**
   - Notification templates dispatch via approved channels (email, SMS, in-app) while recording
     acknowledgement states in the repository.
3. **Preservation**
   - Connectors apply holds, return reference IDs, and optionally self-verify the lock state. Any
     failures mark the hold for remediation and raise compliance alerts.
4. **Monitoring**
   - Automated compliance sweeps evaluate custodian acknowledgements, connector health, and policy
     suspensions. Results appear in dashboards and audit reports.
5. **E-Discovery Collection**
   - Matter teams trigger targeted exports. Export metadata (path, format, counts) is preserved for
     downstream validation and review ingestion.
6. **Release**
   - Upon case closure, connectors remove preservation locks, custodians are notified of release,
     and lifecycle policies resume. Final custody and audit events close the chain.

## Control Mapping
- **SOC 2 CC8.1 / CC7.4** – Demonstrated through automated audit logging, verification checkpoints,
  and retention policy integration.
- **ISO 27001 A.12.3.1 & A.18.1.3** – Evidence of information backup, retention suspension, and
  compliance with legal requirements via recorded policy overrides and export manifests.
- **NIST SP 800-53 (RA-5, AU-6)** – Monitoring and auditing of preservation operations with chain
  of custody ensures traceability and accountability.
- **FRCP 37(e)** – Proactive suspension of deletion routines and documentation of preservation
  actions mitigates spoliation risk.

## Operational Runbook Highlights
- **Configuring Connectors**: Register connectors with capabilities (preservation, verification,
  export) and retention overrides. Ensure credentials are scoped to preservation operations only.
- **Notification Templates**: Leverage NotificationService templates tagged with
  `LEGAL_HOLD_NOTICE` to ensure consistent, counsel-approved messaging.
- **Custody Keys**: Manage Ed25519 keys in HSM-backed storage; rotate at least annually and ensure
  the orchestrator has least-privilege access for signing custody events.
- **Monitoring**: Enable Prometheus alerts on failed compliance checkpoints, pending acknowledgers
  older than 48 hours, and connectors lacking verification within SLA.
- **Documentation & Review**: Export audit packages (`generateAuditPackage`) before regulator or
  court submissions to provide immutable evidence bundles.

## Data Lifecycle Integration
- Lifecycle policies provided to the orchestrator are automatically marked as suspended for the
  duration of the hold. Synthetic overrides are created for connectors without formal policy IDs,
  ensuring every data stream is governed.
- Upon release, the orchestrator resumes policies and records release acknowledgements, closing the
  compliance loop.

## E-Discovery Support
- Export metadata captures format, path, counts, and timestamps. Integrate with review tooling via
  automation hooks or manual downloads.
- Supports iterative exports by maintaining the latest collection set while retaining prior audit
  references for defensibility.

## Chain-of-Custody Assurance
- Every initiation, verification run, export, and release emits custody events stored with
  cryptographic signatures. Verification routines confirm chain integrity prior to producing an
  audit bundle.
- Custody verification status is surfaced in the audit package to simplify court declarations and
  regulator attestations.
