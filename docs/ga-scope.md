# GA Scope

## IN SCOPE

*   Investigation lifecycle (create → enrich → analyze → report)
*   Entity + relationship graph (Neo4j)
*   GraphRAG retrieval
*   Agent orchestration (core loop only)
*   ABAC / OPA enforcement
*   Audit logging
*   Single deployment path (Docker Compose → K8s optional)

## OUT OF SCOPE (explicitly)

*   Exotic connectors
*   Multi‑cloud
*   UI polish beyond usability
*   “Smart” agents that require human babysitting
*   Performance heroics not tied to correctness
*   Anything not in this doc is auto‑rejected until GA+1.
