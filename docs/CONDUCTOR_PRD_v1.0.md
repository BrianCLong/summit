## 1) Executive Summary

**Vision (1 sentence):**
Conductor intelligently routes, governs, and operates expert workflows at enterprise scale—with built‑in learning, cost control, isolation, resilience, offline sync, and continuous compliance.

**Target Users & Use Cases:**

- **Platform/Infra Teams**: centralize expert orchestration, policy enforcement, and cost governance.
- **Applied AI/ML Teams**: rapid iteration on expert strategies with online learning & eval gates.
- **Ops/SRE/Sec/GRC**: auditable runbooks, tenant isolation, compliance automation, incident response.

**Differentiator & Value:**

- Learning router (Thompson Sampling + LinUCB) with production safety (shadow/canary) + cost‑aware scheduling + OPA isolation + signed runbooks + CRDT edge sync + automated SOC2/GDPR. Competitors rarely combine all six pillars natively.

**Success Definition & Metrics (12‑week post‑GA targets):**

- **North Star**: Weekly Active Tenants running evaluated, policy‑compliant routed executions ≥ **40**.
- **Routing Quality**: Golden‑set win‑rate vs. baseline ≥ **+12 p.p.**; regression gate false‑negative rate ≤ **2%**.
- **Cost Efficiency**: $/successful task ≤ **–20%** vs. pre‑Conductor baseline at equal quality.
- **Reliability**: Platform SLOs met (API p95 < **300 ms**; uptime ≥ **99.9%**; failed tasks ≤ **0.5%**).
- **Compliance**: 100% critical controls continuously monitored; audit evidence freshness ≤ **24h**.

**Business Alignment:**

- Supports revenue via enterprise readiness, lowers COGS by scheduling/auto‑scaling, reduces risk via OPA/compliance, accelerates roadmap through automation.

**Resourcing & Timeline:**

- **Effort**: Delivered. Post‑GA hardening & console UX: **M**.
- **Milestones**: Alpha → Beta → **GA (Delivered)** → H1'26: Multi‑region/bring‑your‑own‑key (BYOK) & fine‑grained lineage.
- **Team**: PM (1), BE (3), MLE (2), SRE (2), Sec/GRC (1), QA (1), DX/Docs (1).
- **Budget**: Cloud infra, KEDA/HPA, Redis, observability, PKI/HSM (phase‑in), vulnerability mgmt.

---

## 2) Problem Statement & Opportunity

**User Pain:**

- Fragmented expert routing with manual heuristics → inconsistent quality, high cost, slow iteration.
- Lack of guardrails → regressions ship; evaluation is ad hoc and non‑blocking.
- Unpredictable spend under bursty demand; no budget enforcement or graceful degradation.
- Weak tenant isolation/governance → enterprise blockers.
- Operational procedures untracked; approvals ad hoc; poor auditability.
- Edge/field workflows break offline; conflict resolution is manual and error‑prone.
- Compliance evidence collection is labor‑intensive and stale.

**Impact (before Conductor):** elevated COGS, slower delivery cycles, increased incident risk, enterprise deals stalled by security/compliance gaps.

**Opportunity:** unify learning‑based routing, automated evaluation, cost scheduling, strong isolation, auditable runbooks, offline sync, and compliance automation into one platform → higher win‑rate at lower cost with enterprise‑grade trust.

**Success Criteria:** listed in §1; additionally: Support ticket volume per 1k tasks **–30%**; Time‑to‑approve runbooks **–50%**; Edge merge conflicts auto‑resolved **≥85%**.

---

## 3) Users & Research Inputs

**Personas**

- **Platform Owner (Primary)**: needs reliable, governable orchestration; success = uptime, cost predictability, audits pass.
- **Applied ML Engineer (Primary)**: needs fast iteration + safe deploys; success = win‑rate improvement with guardrails.
- **SRE/On‑Call (Secondary)**: needs repeatable mitigations; success = MTTR reduction.
- **Security/GRC (Secondary)**: needs continuous evidence; success = audit‑ready at all times.

**As‑Is vs. To‑Be Workflows (abridged)**

- _Routing_: manual rules → **adaptive bandits** with shadow/canary and reward ingestion.
- _Quality_: sporadic tests → **golden tasks** per expert type, blocking **quality gates** in CI/CD.
- _Cost/Scale_: manual autoscaling → **queue‑backed workers** + **KEDA/HPA** + budget enforcement.
- _Governance_: app‑level checks → **OPA** policies with **tag propagation** and audit logs.
- _Ops_: tribal runbooks → **signed runbooks** with multi‑stage approvals & execution audit trails.
- _Edge_: brittle sync → **CRDT + vector clocks** with automatic conflict resolution.
- _Compliance_: manual evidence → **control testing** & **risk scoring** pipelines.

**Accessibility/Localization**: Console UI adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA; date/time/number locale aware; motion‑reduced graphs where user preference is set.

## 4) Scope & Requirements

### 4.1 Must‑Have (Delivered MVP)

**M1 — Adaptive Router v2**

- **Stories**
  - As a platform, I want contextual routing (Thompson Sampling & LinUCB) so tasks pick the best expert given features.
  - As an operator, I want shadow/canary to test strategies without risk.

- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - `/v1/router/route` returns expert choice with confidence & rationale; p95 < 250 ms at 150 rps.
  - Shadow routes emit metrics but never affect user output; canary % configurable per tenant.
  - Reward events (`success_at_k`, `human_thumbs`, `incident_free`, etc.) update models within **≤ 60s**.
  - Exploration constrained by tenant policy; emergency kill‑switch available.

**M2 — Evaluation Harness & Quality Gates**

- **Stories**: As an ML team, I can execute golden tasks per expert in parallel with timeouts and regression detection; CI posts pass/fail to PRs.
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - `conductor-eval.sh` exits non‑zero on regression > tolerance; PR comment shows deltas and links to dashboard.
  - Trend charts maintained per expert; baseline snapshotting; flaky test quarantine support.

**M3 — Cost‑Aware Scheduling & Autoscaling**

- **Stories**: As a tenant admin, I set budgets/priority; system uses Redis queues, autoscaling via KEDA/HPA, and degrades gracefully.
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Budget breach triggers priority multipliers & optional throttling; events recorded.
  - Workers expose health/metrics; queue depth drives scale within 60s of deviation.

**M4 — Tenant Isolation via OPA & Tag Propagation**

- **Stories**: As Security, I enforce Rego policies for data/operation access; all resources carry tenant tags.
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Every request passes `/v1/policy/authorize`; decision & input context logged.
  - Masking/filters applied per policy; cross‑tenant operations require explicit allow + approval.

**M5 — Signed Runbook Registry w/ Approvals**

- **Stories**: As SRE, I publish RSA‑signed runbooks, require multi‑stage approvals, and see step‑level audit.
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Only signed runbooks execute; signature verified; tamper attempts blocked & alerted.
  - Approval windows/roles configurable; timeouts enforced; execution trail immutable.

**M6 — Edge/Offline Pilot with CRDT Sync**

- **Stories**: As a field operator, I continue work offline; CRDT + vector clocks reconcile upon sync; conflicts surfaced with safe defaults.
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Sync API supports node registration, op push/pull, and health; ≥ 85% conflicts auto‑resolved.
  - Manual resolution UI shows causal history; merges are idempotent.

**M7 — Compliance Automation (SOC2/GDPR)**

- **Stories**: As GRC, I continuously test controls, collect evidence, score risks, and schedule audits.
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Control tests run on schedule and on change; evidence links stored; findings tracked to remediation.

### 4.2 Should/Could‑Have (Post‑MVP)

- Advanced explainer for routing decisions (feature attribution).
- BYOK/HSM for signing & secrets; customer‑managed keys per tenant.
- Multi‑region active‑active + data residency controls.
- Console UX enhancements (workflows, heatmaps, topology views).
- Simulation sandbox for strategy A/Bs on historical traces.

### 4.3 Won't‑Have (Now)

- Cross‑cloud federation; on‑prem appliance.

## 16) Tenant Rollout Playbook (Repeatable)

**Waves:**

1. **Wave A (5 tenants)**: low risk, internal/partners; 1‑week soak.
2. **Wave B (15 tenants)**: medium risk/prod; 2‑week soak.
3. **Wave C (all)**: full enablement.

**Per‑Tenant Checklist:**

- [ ] Create tenant in IAM; assign roles (viewer/operator/admin/tenant‑admin)
- [ ] Load routing context schema & candidates; dry‑run router with shadow=100%
- [ ] Seed golden suites; set regression tolerances; enable CI status checks
- [ ] Configure budget window & limits; set grace & throttling policy
- [ ] Attach OPA bundle; run policy/dry‑run against top 50 APIs; review denies
- [ ] Import approved runbooks; verify signatures; define approval stages
- [ ] Register edge nodes (if applicable); run offline exercise & conflict drill
- [ ] Verify telemetry: route_decision, eval_regression, budget_breach, policy_denied, runbook_executed, edge_conflict
- [ ] SLO alert test (burn rate), rollback drill, support playbook handoff
- [ ] Go/No‑Go sign‑offs: Tenant Admin, Security, SRE, Support

**Canary Ramp:** 5% → 25% → 100% (24h minimum at each step unless alerts/regressions).

---

## 17) Acceptance Test Pack (Gherkin Snippets)

**Router**

```
Feature: Contextual routing chooses best expert safely
  Scenario: Route with shadow strategy
    Given tenant "acme" has candidates ["graph_ops","rag_retrieval"]
    And shadow mode is 100%
    When I POST /api/conductor/router/route with context {"lang":"en"}
    Then the response includes expertId and confidence
    And the user-visible output is produced by the baseline expert
    And a route_decision event is emitted within 500ms
```

**Canary rollback**

```
Scenario: Auto-rollback on error spike
  Given canary is 10%
  And baseline error rate is < 1%
  When canary error rate exceeds 5% for 5 minutes
  Then traffic to candidate is set to 0%
  And an alert "router_canary_rollback" is fired
```

**Budget enforcement**

```
Scenario: Throttle on budget breach
  Given monthly budget is $1000 with grace 10%
  When projected spend reaches $1100
  Then scheduler applies priority multipliers and throttling within 60s
  And a budget_breach event is recorded
```

**OPA authorization**

```
Scenario: Deny cross-tenant read without approval
  Given user role is tenant-admin of "acme"
  When they request resource of tenant "globex"
  Then /policy/authorize returns allow=false with obligation "request_approval"
```

**Runbooks**

```
Scenario: Signed runbook required
  Given a runbook with tampered content
  When execute is requested
  Then execution is rejected and an unsigned_runbook alert is fired
```

**CRDT sync**

```
Scenario: Auto-resolve concurrent updates
  Given two edge nodes edit the same OR-Map key offline
  When they sync
  Then ≥85% of conflicts are auto-resolved
  And unresolved conflicts surface in the conflict center UI
```

**Compliance**

```
Scenario: Evidence freshness
  Given SOC2 control CC6.1 requires log retention evidence
  When the daily job runs
  Then evidence freshness is < 24h
```

---

## 18) SLOs, Telemetry & Alerts (Ready to Configure)

**SLOs**

- Router: p95 < 250ms, error rate < 0.5%
- Policy: p95 < 100ms, decision cache hit > 90%

  IF increase(http_request_errors_total{svc="router"}[5m])
     / increase(http_requests_total{svc="router"}[5m]) > 0.01
  FOR 10m
  LABELS {severity="page"}
  ANNOTATIONS {summary="Router errors >1%"}
```

```
ALERT QueueDepthAnomaly
  IF max_over_time(queue_depth{queue=~"heavy_.*"}[15m]) > 10000
  FOR 15m

## 29) Patent-Grade vNext Feature Portfolio (IntelGraph + Maestro Conductor)

The next major IntelGraph + Maestro Conductor release leans into seven novel inventions that compound reliability, compliance, and autonomy advantages. Each concept is structured for patent pursuit while remaining tightly scoped for PRD execution. Together they extend the Conductor platform into a self-governing, provably compliant delivery fabric that rivals cannot easily replicate.

### Feature 1 — Automated SLO-Gated Multi-Environment Canary + Rollback

**Patentable Invention:** Progressive delivery spine that spans dev → staging → canary → production with live burn-rate sentinels. Maestro automates promotion decisions using cross-environment SLO telemetry, policy posture, and security signals, and executes zero-downtime rollback within 10 seconds when anomalies emerge.

**Key PRD Criteria**

- Canary promotions must be blocked unless live SLO dashboards remain green across latency, error, policy, and security channels.
- Rollback automation executes without human approval, preserves state continuity, and completes within <10 seconds.
- Container images, OPA bundles, SBOMs, and evidentiary logs stay artifact-synced across all environments with immutable traceability.

### Feature 2 — Provenance-Attested Evidence Bundle Generation

**Patentable Invention:** Autonomous evidence bundler that signs SLSA provenance, Rekor entries, SPDX SBOMs, OPA/conftest verdicts, and runtime obligations into a tamper-evident chain at build, deploy, and migration checkpoints. Auditors can verify compliance as code without manual intervention.

**Key PRD Criteria**

- Every release emits a cryptographically signed evidence bundle with machine-verifiable provenance.
- Policy and provenance chains must be replayable by any auditor and enforceable as hard gates in CI/CD.
- Evidence retention policies enforce WORM semantics with automated lifecycle management.

### Feature 3 — Integrated ABAC/OPA Policy Simulation Zone

**Patentable Invention:** Dedicated simulation sandbox for ABAC, RBAC, and OPA/Rego policies that executes on every PR, migration, and rollout. Developers receive “what-if” diffs and enforcement traces before merge, and Maestro blocks deployments that violate projected policy outcomes.

**Key PRD Criteria**

- All code, infrastructure, and data migrations must pass dry-run policy simulations as a merge blocker.
- Visual diffs show how policy changes impact each environment with traceable approval lineage.
- High-risk policies execute inside an isolated enforcement zone before production activation.

### Feature 4 — AI-Augmented Build Failure Diagnosis + Remediation Fabric

**Patentable Invention:** Agent swarm that correlates CI logs, dependency graphs, migration history, and recent merges to derive root-cause hypotheses. The fabric proposes patch diffs with confidence scoring, enabling human review or autonomous remediation backed by regression testing.

**Key PRD Criteria**

- Every Maestro failure automatically spawns an agent analysis with root-cause callouts and upstream impact assessment.
- Suggested fixes include generated diffs, required test matrices, and approval routing (auto vs. manual).
- Confidence dashboards document verification status after rerunning targeted tests.

### Feature 5 — Universal Data/Model Context Protocol (MCP) Orchestration Grid

**Patentable Invention:** Unified protocol that carries context between graph analytics, ML inference, search, and workflow microservices. Maestro routes persona-specific workloads across this grid, persisting provenance and evidence at each hop for replayable audits.

**Key PRD Criteria**

- MCP maintains traceable context propagation across graph, ML, workflow, and policy services with deterministic replay.
- AI/ML model upgrades flow through the same orchestration grid without bespoke integrations.
- Every context transition attaches provenance evidence, signatures, and retention hooks.

### Feature 6 — Multi-Format, Immutable SBOM + Vulnerability Gate Service

**Patentable Invention:** Continuous SBOM generation (CycloneDX + SPDX) fused with SARIF/Trivy/ZAP scanners. Deployment blocks automatically when risk thresholds trigger, with artifact-level transparency and historical indexing across the repo.

**Key PRD Criteria**

- SBOM and vulnerability scans run on every PR, build, and release with artifact links in Maestro dashboards.
- Risk thresholds determine block/allow states with auditable overrides and justifications.
- SBOM outputs remain immutable, versioned, and searchable across release history.

### Feature 7 — Policy-Driven Self-Healing Observability + Cost Optimization Layer

**Patentable Invention:** Reinforcement learning and declarative policies synthesize metrics, traces, logs, and spend telemetry to forecast operational risk. Maestro proactively scales resources, triggers diagnostics, or freezes pipelines until remediation is complete.

**Key PRD Criteria**

- Live metric, anomaly, and cost signals must be actionable inputs for deployment posture and scaling decisions.
- Self-healing actions (freeze, alert, rollback, diagnostics) execute automatically with captured provenance.
- RL feedback loops continuously refine risk forecasts and failover orchestration across all environments.
