# IntelGraph v2.5 — GA Delta Plan: Completion Summary

## Executive Summary

IntelGraph v2.5 is production-ready with hardened GraphQL APIs, PostgreSQL/Neo4j data layers, real-time detection→incident→SOAR automations, audited MLOps promotion gates, and enterprise guardrails across crypto and OSINT workflows. The release aligns to the Council Wishbook's "GA Core" capabilities (ingest/graph/analytics/copilot + governance), backed by acceptance-criteria patterns for explainability, policy-by-default, and provenance integrity.

## 🚀 What Shipped (Highlights)

### GraphQL & API

New schemas and resolvers spanning real-time security, MLOps lifecycle, OSINT/forensics, and crypto controls, with persisted queries and field-level auth. Acceptance patterns emphasize explainability and rollback/undo for generated queries.

### Data Tier

PostgreSQL migrations for detections/incidents, MLOps artifacts, OSINT tasks/forensics, and crypto approvals/HSM ops; Neo4j indexes & temporal/relationship tuning for cross-domain correlation. (Backed by the Canonical Model & bitemporal/geo-temporal constructs.)

### RT Detection → Incident → SOAR Loop

Subscriptions for live alerts, thresholded auto-escalation, async playbooks, RBAC and full audit. Playbooks map to runbook DAGs (CTI, DFIR, AML, crisis) with KPIs and XAI notes.

### MLOps Promotion Gates & Model Evaluation

Multi-gate pipeline (accuracy/F1/regression/security/bias), drift detection, A/B with safe rollback, registry+lineage; all with model-card style explainability.

### Security Guardrails (Crypto & OSINT)

Dual-control approvals, export-control validation (ITAR/EAR-like), legal-basis validation for OSINT, rate-limits, immutable audit, and step-up auth.

### Testing

k6 perf; Playwright E2E (50+); authz depth limits; screenshot diffs; chaos drills and soak tests; security tests for policy simulation/blocked actions.

### Helm & Network Policies

Zero-trust ingress, Pod Security (restricted), multi-env values with production hardening, sealed-secrets and canary gates.

### Runbooks & Ops Docs

Production deployment, incident response, and operator procedures; plus a library of investigation runbooks (R1–R10+) with triggers, steps, KPIs, and rollback.

## Architecture & Security Alignment

### Governance by Design

ABAC/RBAC, OPA policies, warrant/authority binding at query time, reason-for-access prompts, audit search and ombuds loops.

### Privacy & Compliance

GDPR/CCPA purpose limitation, minimization/redaction, data-residency tags, export-control validation, dual-control exports.

### Threat Model Coverage

Controls for insider misuse, prompt injection, poisoning; JIT access, step-up auth, honeytokens, immutable audit.

## Production-Readiness Metrics (SLOs & Ops)

### Performance

Designed to meet p95 graph query <1.5–2.0s on typical neighborhoods; ingestion E2E targets and ER throughput defined; perf tests attached to CI.

### Reliability & DR

Cross-region replicas, PITR backups, chaos drills (pod/broker kill), topology failover and offline kits.

### Observability

OTEL traces, Prom metrics, SLO burn alerts, cost guardrails and budget caps.

## Compliance & Ethics Guardrails

"Won't build" constraints and declined feature sets are codified (mass repression, targeted violence, bulk deanonymization, human-subject manipulation). Defensive alternatives are documented and wired into policy reasons.

## 📦 Release Deliverables Inventory

## 🧭 Post-GA (Q3–Q4 2025) Focus

### Immediate (Q3 2025)

- **Prov-Ledger GA**: Evidence registration + verifiable export manifests (moving from beta→GA in v2.5.1)
- **Disinfo Runbook Suite**: Productized investigation playbooks for demos and training
- **Full SLO Dashboard Recommendations**: Balanced perf/cost/reliability executive view

### Near-term (Q4 2025)

- **Predictive Threat Suite** (alpha hardening): Timeline horizon+bands, counterfactual sim, causal explainer—already Helm-deployable
- **Graph-XAI Everywhere Integration**: Cross-platform explainable AI capabilities
- **Regulated Topologies**: Air-gapped/hybrid/region-sharded pre-baked configurations

### Operations Maturation

- SLO dashboards + cost guards + chaos drills cadence
- Offline kit v1 roll-out to field teams
- Runbooks expansion: DFIR/AML/disinfo/human-rights sets with measurable KPIs & XAI notes

### Long-term Vision

- Graph-XAI everywhere, federated search, marketplace, and crisis cell enhancements
- See mid/long-term roadmap for comprehensive feature evolution

## 🛡️ Sign-off Checklist (Executive)

- ✅ **Governance**: ABAC/RBAC + OPA + warrant binding + ombuds loops
- ✅ **Provenance & Integrity**: Export manifests + chain-of-custody + blocked-without-citation publishing
- ✅ **SLO Posture**: p95 targets, autoscaling policies, DR drillbooks in place
- ✅ **Ethics Gate**: "Won't build" enforcement with defensive alternatives

## 🧾 GA Release Notes (Customer-Facing)

**New**: Real-time detections to incidents with automated SOAR, audited MLOps promotions, OSINT/forensics & crypto guardrails, Helm-based hardening, and a growing runbook library. Governance by design with policy-by-default denials, explainable automation, and verifiable provenance.
