**Repository:** `BrianCLong/summit`  
**Prepared by:** IntelGraph Maestro Conductor (MC)

## 1) Executive Overview

The Maestro Conductor GA release is fully complete, hardened, and production-ready. All artifacts are reproducible from tag, integrity-verified in CI/CD, and accompanied by a printable sign-off packet and auditor-ready evidence.

**Hardening in place:** nightly verification (04:17 UTC), immutable tag protection, Grafana GA health dashboard, and a comprehensive RUNBOOK with rollback quick-card and post-GA watch procedures.

---

## 2) Deliverables at a Glance

### GA Sign-Off Materials (`docs/releases/ga-signoff/`):
- `GA_SIGNOFF_PACKET.md` (canonical packet with Appendices A & B)
- `GA_SIGNOFF_SHEET.md` (approvals one-pager)
- `GA_QUICK_SIGNOFF.md` (quick reference)

### Release Scripts (`scripts/`):
- `gen-release-manifest.mjs`, `gen-release-attestation.mjs`, `verify-release-manifest.mjs`
- `check-ga-packet.sh` (packet + links verifier)
- `final-ga-verification.sh` (end-to-end verification)

### CI/CD (`.github/workflows/`):
- `release-artifacts.yml` (tag-push → build, verify, upload)
- `check-ga-packet.yml` (prevents regressions in packet/links)

### Artifacts (`dist/`):
- `release-manifest-v2025.10.07.yaml` (paths, SHA256s, commit SHAs)
- `release-attestation-v2025.10.07.jsonld` (JSON-LD verifiable credential)
- `evidence-v0.3.2-mc-nightly.json` (SLO & compliance evidence)

### Docs:
- GA announcement, implementation summaries, and final verification summary.

## 4) Deployment Steps (Operator-Ready)

1. **Tag Push:** push `v2025.10.07` → triggers `release-artifacts.yml`.
2. **Automatic Generation:** workflow builds, verifies, uploads manifest + attestation + evidence to Release.
3. **Publication:** artifacts appear on the GitHub Release; hashes published for verification.

---

## 5) Security & Compliance

- **Integrity:** SHA256s for critical artifacts; verification gate in CI.
- **Provenance:** commit SHAs + JSON-LD verifiable credentials; cosign/keyless ready.
- **Evidence:** SLO/compliance snapshot attached; auditor-friendly packet and final verification summary.
- **Reproducibility:** dependency locks and deterministic hashing.

---

## 6) CI/CD Integration & Observability

- **Gates:** pre-build verify; post-build attestation; release promotion verify.
- **Nightly verification:** 04:17 UTC (strict mode, SHA assertions) against latest GA tag.
- **Dashboards:** Grafana GA health (release status, verification, artifact counts, deploy overview, latency SLOs).
- **Alerts:** verification failures, missing evidence, or drift.
