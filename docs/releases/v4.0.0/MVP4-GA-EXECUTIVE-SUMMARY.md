# MVP-4-GA: Executive Summary

> **"From Playground to Platform"**

---

## The Strategic Shift

**MVP-3-GA** proved that Summit _works_. It demonstrated the core value proposition: AI-augmented graph analytics, temporal intelligence, and real-time collaboration. It was our "Feature Complete" milestone.

**MVP-4-GA** proves that Summit _sustains_. It is our "Enterprise Grade" milestone.
We are shifting focus from **"Can it do X?"** to **"Can we trust it with the Crown Jewels?"**

## Why This Release Matters

### 1. Audit-Proof Trust

Enterprise customers don't just buy features; they buy **governance**. MVP-4-GA introduces:

- **Cryptographic Chain of Custody**: We can prove exactly what code processed what data.
- **Policy-as-Code**: Compliance isn't a manual checkbox; it's a compile-time guarantee.

### 2. Operational Determinism

We are eliminating "undefined behavior".

- **Hard Invariants**: The system fails safely and predictably, protecting data integrity over availability if forced to choose.
- **Self-Healing**: Automated regression testing prevents bad code from ever reaching production.

### 3. Scalability Foundation

You cannot scale chaos. By hardening our schemas, locking down our dependencies, and strictly defining our error budgets, we build the rigid structure necessary to support:

- Multi-region deployment.
- High-volume ingestion.
- Third-party developer ecosystems.

## The Bottom Line

MVP-4-GA is not about "new buttons" on the UI. It is about the **invisible armor** required to sell to regulated industries, defense sectors, and large enterprises. It transforms Summit from a prototype into a product.
