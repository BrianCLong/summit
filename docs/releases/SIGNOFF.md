# Release Review Summary

 This document explains the purpose of the Release Review Summary and how to interpret it.

 ## Overview

 The Release Review Summary is a consolidated report generated by the CI pipeline for every release-intent build. It is designed to provide reviewers with a quick, high-level overview of the release eligibility and point them to the necessary evidence artifacts.

 ## Where to Find It

 1.  **GitHub Actions Job Summary**: The summary is appended to the job summary of the `Release Gate` workflow run.
 2.  **Artifacts**: A `release-review-summary` artifact (containing `summary.md`) is uploaded to the workflow run.

 ## Content

 The summary includes:

 *   **Decision**: `✅ ELIGIBLE` or `🚫 NOT ELIGIBLE`
 *   **Top Reasons**: The top 3 blocking issues if the release is not eligible.
 *   **Artifact Index**: A list of key artifacts (Evidence Bundle, Dashboard, Release Notes, etc.) and their status (Found/Missing).
 *   **Regeneration Commands**: Commands to regenerate the artifacts locally if needed.

 ## Interpreting "NOT ELIGIBLE"

 If the decision is `NOT ELIGIBLE`, check the "Top Reasons" section. Common reasons include:

 *   **Freeze Window Active**: The release is blocked because a change freeze is in effect.
 *   **Check Failed**: One or more required checks (preflight, verify, etc.) failed.
 *   **Missing Artifacts**: Required artifacts were not generated.

 Refer to the `release-status.json` or the full build logs for detailed error messages.
