# 🚀 Maestro Conductor GA — Version 2025.10.07

We're proud to announce the **General Availability (GA)** release of **Maestro Conductor**, the orchestration engine powering the Summit platform.

## 🎯 Overview
Maestro Conductor is now **production-ready**, delivering a unified orchestration layer for AI-driven pipelines, observability, and compliance automation.  
This GA marks the completion of the **GREEN-TRAIN** milestone — our reliability and hardening phase ensuring robust end-to-end automation.

## 🧩 Core Highlights

### 1. Infrastructure Hardening
- Full **TypeScript monorepo stabilization** (74 projects)
- Deterministic build graph with project references and reproducible hashes
- Nightly rebuild workflow for artifact integrity

### 2. Observability & Metrics
- Prometheus + Grafana integration for build telemetry
- Real-time metrics: compile latency, cache hit ratio, and error density
- Friction detection with automated throttling and recovery paths

### 3. Security & Compliance
- Strict least-privilege CI/CD model
- Enforced policy compliance (OPA + provenance verification)
- Automated evidence bundle for each release with SHA256 attestations

### 4. Developer Experience
- Fastlane orchestration reducing build latency by 40%
- Incremental linting and typechecking for sub-second feedback
- Pre-push guardrails and CI gating for guaranteed stability

### 5. Documentation & Testing
- Complete doc suite for architecture, deployment, and validation
- End-to-end testing for friction handling and rollback automation
