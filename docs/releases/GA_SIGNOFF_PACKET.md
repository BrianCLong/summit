# ðŸŽ¯ Maestro Conductor â€” GA Signâ€‘Off Packet

**Release ID:** `v2025.10.07`
**Release Date:** 2025-10-07 (America/Denver)
**Repository:** `BrianCLong/summit`
**Branch:** `release-artifact-verification-system`
**Prepared by:** IntelGraph Maestro Conductor (MC)

## 1) Executive Summary (One Screen)

**Goal:** Ship Maestro Conductor GA with verifiable, reproducible release artifacts (manifest, attestation, evidence) wired into CI/CD and GitHub Releases.

**Scope (Delivered):**

* Release manifest & attestation generators; integrity verifier; GA validation script; Makefile shortcuts.
* GitHub workflow on tag push â†’ builds, verifies, uploads assets to the Release.
* Evidence bundle (SLO + compliance) attached; public GA announcement prepared.

**Nonâ€‘Goals (postâ€‘GA):** Multiâ€‘region DR drills; data residency migrations; phaseâ€‘next connectors; privacy automation at scale.

**Constraints:** Org SLOs & cost guardrails enforced; provenance on by default; reproducible builds; auditâ€‘ready.

**Assumptions:** Tag `v2025.10.07` is the GA cut; evidence reflects current SLO/errorâ€‘budget; dependencies locked for deterministic hashes.

**Risks & Mitigations:**

* Supplyâ€‘chain drift â†’ frozen locks + hash pinning; verify gate.
* Postâ€‘upload tamper â†’ manifest verification + checksums; ready for cosign/keyless.
* Cost overrun during fanâ€‘out â†’ budget alerts at 80% threshold.

**Definition of Done:** Artifacts verified & uploaded; announcement staged; validation passed; rollback plan documented.

## 3) Artifacts (Reproducible & Verifiable)

| Type        | Path                                          | Purpose                                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manifest    | `dist/release-manifest-v2025.10.07.yaml`      | Canonical listing of artifacts with SHA256, source commits, build env metadata |
| Attestation | `dist/release-attestation-v2025.10.07.jsonld` | JSONâ€‘LD verifiable credential describing provenance                            |
| Evidence    | `dist/evidence-v0.3.2-mc-nightly.json`        | SLO & compliance snapshot + verification results                               |

**Generation & Validation Commands**

```bash
npm run release:manifest   # Generate manifest
npm run release:attest     # Generate attestation
npm run release:verify     # Validate manifest hashes vs. artifacts
./scripts/validate-ga.sh   # Endâ€‘toâ€‘end GA validation
```

---

## 4) CI/CD Wiring

* **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml` â†’ trigger on tag push.
* **Outputs:** Manifest, attestation, evidence uploaded to the GitHub Release.
* **Convenience:** `Makefile` oneâ€‘liners; npm scripts: `release:manifest`, `release:attest`, `release:verify`.

---

## 5) Org Defaults & SLO Guardrails (Attested)

* **GraphQL Gateway:** Reads p95 â‰¤ 350 ms / Writes p95 â‰¤ 700 ms; 99.9% monthly availability.
* **Neo4j Ops:** 1â€‘hop p95 â‰¤ 300 ms; 2â€“3 hop p95 â‰¤ 1200 ms.
* **Ingest:** â‰¥ 1,000 events/s per pod; p95 preâ€‘storage processing â‰¤ 100 ms.
* **Cost:** Dev â‰¤ $1k/mo; Staging â‰¤ $3k/mo; Prod â‰¤ $18k/mo (LLM â‰¤ $5k/mo; alert at 80%).
* **MC Behavior:** SLO gates in CI; errorâ€‘budget + cost burn alerts autoâ€‘open issues.

---

## 6) Security Â· Privacy Â· Provenance

* **Integrity:** SHA256 for all critical artifacts; verification step is a release gate.
* **Provenance:** Commit SHAs embedded; JSONâ€‘LD VC attestation; cosign/keyless **ready**.
* **Privacy/Policy Seeds:** OIDC + JWT; ABAC/OPA; fieldâ€‘level encryption for sensitive attributes; retention defaults (standardâ€‘365d, PII shortâ€‘30d unless legalâ€‘hold).
* **Auditability:** Immutable provenance ledger; export manifest format compatible with evidence bundle.

## 7) Rollback / Backout Plan

1. Freeze promotions; halt new tag deployments.
2. Repoint "Latest" to prior stable tag; revoke GA tag alias if used.
3. Publish `*-revoked.yaml` with reason/CVE/ticket; mark Release as retracted in notes.
4. Disable promote step via `RELEASE_PROMOTE=false` in CI.
5. Cut hotfix branch `hotfix/<issue>` â†’ tag `vYYYY.MM.DD+hotfix.N`; run full verification chain.
6. Issue comms + postâ€‘mortem; attach updated evidence to the corrective Release.

## 8) Acceptance Criteria â†’ Verification Steps

| AC   | Acceptance Criteria                                       | Verification                                                          |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ACâ€‘1 | Manifest includes paths, SHA256, source commits           | `npm run release:manifest` then `npm run release:verify` = PASS       |
| ACâ€‘2 | Attestation conforms to JSONâ€‘LD context & required claims | Schema validation; reject on missing proofs                           |
| ACâ€‘3 | CI workflow attaches artifacts to Release on tag push     | Workflow logs show successful uploads; hashes match                   |
| ACâ€‘4 | Evidence bundle contains SLO/compliance snapshots         | Parse `dist/evidence-*.json`; assert required sections present & PASS |
| ACâ€‘5 | Docs exist (announcement + runbooks)                      | Files resolvable in repo under `docs/releases/`                       |
