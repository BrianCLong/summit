# Stabilization Review Pack

This document describes the Stabilization Review Pack, a deliverable for weekly review meetings.

## What's Included

The Stabilization Review Pack is a single zipped artifact that bundles the following items into one deterministic deliverable:

- `README.md`: A guide on how to read the contents of the pack.
- `MANIFEST.json`: A list of all files in the pack, along with their SHA256 hashes.
- `STABILIZATION_DASHBOARD.md`: The stabilization dashboard.
- `SCORECARD_<date>.md`: The latest scorecard.
- `escalation.md`: The escalation report.
- `diff.md`: The change diff for the reporting period.
- `validation_report.md`: The evidence and issuance compliance validation report.
- `evidence/INDEX.md`: An index of evidence for items moved to "DONE" during the week.

## How It's Generated

The Stabilization Review Pack is generated by the `build_stabilization_review_pack.mjs` script, which is run as part of the `weekly-ops-evidence.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.

The script performs the following steps:

1.  Gathers the latest reports and artifacts.
2.  Stages the files into a standardized directory structure.
3.  Generates a `MANIFEST.json` file with SHA256 hashes for all included files.
4.  Zips the entire directory into a deterministically named file: `STABILIZATION_REVIEW_PACK_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<sha>.zip`.

## How to Use

The Stabilization Review Pack is intended to be used in weekly review meetings to provide a consistent and offline-usable snapshot of the project's stabilization progress.

To use the pack:

1.  Download the zip file from the artifacts of the `weekly-ops-evidence.yml` workflow run.
2.  Unzip the file.
3.  Start by reading the `README.md` file for an overview.
4.  Review the other documents as needed.
