### Summit Unveils "Governed AI" Platform for National Security

**New v4.1 Release Bridges the Gap Between Generative AI and Mission Assurance**

**WASHINGTON, D.C. — Jan 19, 2026** — Summit, the leader in sovereign intelligence orchestration, today announced the General Availability of **Summit Platform v4.1**. This major release introduces the industry's first "Governance-Native" architecture, designed to allow government agencies and regulated enterprises to deploy AI at scale without compromising security or auditability.

As organizations rush to adopt Generative AI, they face a critical barrier: the inability to trust and trace model outputs. Summit v4.1 solves this with its proprietary **IntelGraph** technology and **DataEnvelope** protocol, which ensures every AI-generated insight is strictly bound by security policies and traceable to its original source.

"We built Summit v4.1 because 'good enough' doesn't cut it in national security," said [CEO Name], CEO of Summit. "Our customers need the power of a Knowledge Graph combined with the safety of a vault. With our new Maestro engine and unified EKS architecture, we are delivering exactly that."

**Key Features of Summit v4.1:**

- **Maestro Orchestration:** A resilient workflow engine that guarantees task completion even in degraded network environments.
- **DataEnvelope Protocol:** A security wrapper that enforces RBAC and provenance on 100% of API responses.
- **Unified IntelGraph:** A high-performance Neo4j-based graph core that unifies structured and unstructured data.

**Customer Impact**
Early adopters in the defense sector have reported a **50% reduction in analysis time** while maintaining full compliance with strict data handling regulations.

"Summit's new governance features allowed us to finally move our OSINT workflows from manual spreadsheets to automated AI pipelines," said [Customer Name - TBD], [Title]. "The ability to trace every claim back to the source document is a game changer."

**Availability**
Summit Platform v4.1 is available immediately for deployment on AWS GovCloud and on-premise secure enclaves.

**About Summit**
Summit is the Intelligence & Communications Operating System for the sovereign enterprise. We help the world's most critical organizations make sense of chaos.
