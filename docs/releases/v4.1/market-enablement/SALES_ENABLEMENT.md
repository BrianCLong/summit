## One-Pager: The "Elevator Pitch"

**Problem:** Government analysts are overwhelmed. They have 10,000 documents but zero time. They want AI, but they can't trust it.
**Solution:** Summit Platform. The "Iron Man Suit" for analysts. It reads everything, connects the dots (Knowledge Graph), and explains its work (Governance).
**Proof:** "We reduced data ingestion time from 3 days to 3 hours for [Agency X]."
**Ask:** "Do you have a plan for _Auditable_ AI?"

## Discovery Questions

1.  "How do you currently trace an AI summary back to the original secret document?"
2.  "What happens if your current analysis platform goes down during a crisis?"
3.  "Are you struggling to connect data from social media with your internal classified reports?"
4.  "How do you handle 'hallucinations' in your current ML workflow?"

## Objection Handling

- **Objection:** "We already have Palantir."
  - **Rebuttal:** "Palantir is great for structured data. Summit specializes in _unstructured_ narrative analysis and is significantly lighter to deploy/manage."
- **Objection:** "Is it secure?"
  - **Rebuttal:** "Yes. We use a 'DataEnvelope' architecture where security metadata travels with the data. Plus, we are built for FedRAMP High on AWS GovCloud."
- **Objection:** "We don't have budget for a platform."
  - **Rebuttal:** "Summit consolidates your Graph DB, Vector Store, and Workflow engine costs. We usually replace 3-4 disparate tools."
