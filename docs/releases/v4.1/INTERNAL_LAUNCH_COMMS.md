## Subject: LAUNCH DAY: Summit v4.1 is GA! 🚀

Team,

Today is the day. **Summit Platform v4.1 (MVP-4)** is officially General Availability.

This release is the culmination of our "Reliability Hardening" sprint. We have successfully moved to a unified EKS architecture and shipped the new Maestro engine.

**What you need to know:**

- **Sales:** You can now sell "Governance" as a primary feature. The `DataEnvelope` is a huge differentiator.
- **Support:** Watch out for "Migration" tickets. The move to v4.1 requires a DB migration.
- **Eng:** Great job on the 262 passing tests! The build is green.
