# Conductor Release Summary (Next Two Weekly Cuts)

## Goal
Deliver two incremental Conductor releases that tighten tenant-aware orchestration, satisfy regulatory guardrails, and reduce per-tenant operating cost by 12% while maintaining 99.9% workflow SLOs.

## Non-Goals
- Rebuilding the Conductor UX shell or navigation.
- Replacing existing data pipelines outside the scoped tenants.
- Introducing new monetization models beyond existing subscription tiers.

## Assumptions
- Business outcome targets: +20% automation adoption in regulated tenants and <3% rollback rate per cut.
- Org defaults: weekly trunk-based cuts with shared CI, cost guardrails of $4k/$7k/$12k per dev/stage/prod environment respectively.
- Regulatory: FedRAMP High and CJIS tenants require auditable change logs and runtime isolation tagging.
- Operating loop: PM/Eng/Sec triad meets twice weekly; automated evidence ingestion occurs nightly.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Evidence gaps** due to new controls → Embed telemetry hooks per task and pre-wire dashboards for Sec review.
- **Tenant regression** risk from shared orchestration engine → Stage gating with automated tenant smoke tests and blue/green toggles.
- **Cost overrun** from burst scaling → Enforce autoscaling guardrails and weekly FinOps review before cut sign-off.

## Definition of Done
- All scoped Epics reach "Ready for Cut" with passing verification logs linked in evidence store.
- Release scorecard shows SLO ≥99.9%, cost within guardrails, and no Sev1 incidents in dev/stage for 72h.
- Compliance package (change log + RACI sign-offs) delivered to Sec and Ops within 24h post-cut.
