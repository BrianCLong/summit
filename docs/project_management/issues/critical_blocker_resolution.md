# Codex Task: Critical Blocker Resolution

**Priority:** P0  
**Labels:** `ga-blocker`, `stability`, `triage`, `codex-task`

## Desired Outcome
All critical issues blocking GA resolved with documented mitigations.

## Workstreams
- Establish war-room triage cadence with severity matrix and on-call ownership.
- Drive root cause analysis for each GA blocker, capturing fix-forward and prevention actions.
- Validate fixes in staging with regression tests and observability verification.
- Communicate status to leadership via twice-weekly updates and unblock dependencies.

## Key Deliverables
- GA blocker register with severity, owner, ETA, and mitigation notes.
- RCA documents and post-incident reviews for each resolved blocker.
- Verification evidence (test results, dashboards) proving stability post-fix.
- Executive summary highlighting risk burn-down and remaining watch items.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No P0/P1 open issues blocking GA exit criteria.
- Each resolved blocker has validated fix, monitoring guardrail, and documented prevention.
- Stakeholders acknowledge readiness via sign-off in GA dashboard.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Cross-team responsiveness for services owning defects.
- Test environment parity with production configuration.
- Potential discovery of new blockers during hardening.

## Milestones
- **Daily:** Run blocker standup, update register.
- **Within 48h of discovery:** Complete interim mitigation and assign RCA owner.
- **Weekly:** Publish risk burn-down report to GA leadership.
- **GA-2 weeks:** Confirm zero open blockers and freeze change window.
