# Codex Task: Advanced AI/ML Extraction Pipeline

**Priority:** P1  
**Labels:** `ai-ml`, `data-pipeline`, `extraction`, `codex-task`

## Desired Outcome
AI/ML-powered extraction pipeline delivering reliable structured outputs and monitoring.

## Workstreams
- Design multi-stage extraction architecture combining LLM, deterministic parsing, and human-in-the-loop validation.
- Train and fine-tune models using labeled corpora with drift detection and continuous evaluation.
- Build scalable data processing pipeline (batch + streaming) with observability and error remediation loops.
- Expose APIs and UI surfaces for analysts to review, correct, and export structured extractions.

## Key Deliverables
- Extraction architecture blueprint and data contracts.
- Model training assets: datasets, prompt templates, evaluation harness, and performance benchmarks.
- Production-grade pipeline deployment with monitoring dashboards and alerting thresholds.
- Analyst workflow enhancements (review queues, feedback capture, export formats).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Extractions achieve ≥95% precision on critical entities and relations in benchmark set.
- Pipeline processes priority document volumes within agreed latency SLOs.
- Analyst feedback loop reduces manual correction rate by ≥40% after pilot.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Access to labeled data and annotation resources.
- Alignment with Analyst Assist v0.2 to reuse review workflows.
- Model drift risk requiring guardrails and fallback strategies.

## Milestones
- **Week 1:** Finalize architecture, data requirements, and evaluation plan.
- **Week 2-3:** Train/fine-tune models and build evaluation harness.
- **Week 4:** Deploy pipeline to staging with monitoring and feedback UX.
- **Week 5:** Pilot with analysts, collect metrics, and prep for GA rollout.
