# Codex Task: CompanyOS Q0 Foundation

**Priority:** P0  
**Labels:** `companyos`, `foundation`, `platform`, `codex-task`

## Desired Outcome

Foundational CompanyOS Q0 capabilities implemented with baseline SLAs.

## Workstreams

- Define Q0 scope: core modules, data model, workflows, and SLA targets for availability and responsiveness.
- Stand up baseline services (identity, workspace management, permissions) with integration tests and monitoring.
- Migrate critical tenants into Q0 environment with rollout plan and rollback guardrails.
- Establish operational playbooks covering on-call, incident response, and SLA reporting.

## Key Deliverables

- Q0 architecture and service dependency map.
- Baseline service implementations with CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code.
- Migration runbook and validation reports for early adopter tenants.
- SLA dashboard and operational metrics for Q0 services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Core Q0 services meet defined SLA targets for 30-day steady state.
- Early adopters complete migration with no Sev-1 incidents and positive adoption feedback.
- Operational playbooks approved and on-call rotations staffed.

## Dependencies & Risks

- Infrastructure capacity planning and environment readiness.
- Coordination with GTM and Support for early adopter onboarding.
- Potential integration debt with legacy CompanyOS components.

## Milestones

- **Week 1:** Finalize Q0 scope, architecture, and SLA definitions.
- **Week 2-3:** Build and deploy baseline services with automated tests.
- **Week 4:** Execute limited-scope tenant migrations and validation.
- **Week 5:** Launch SLA dashboards and transition to steady-state operations.
