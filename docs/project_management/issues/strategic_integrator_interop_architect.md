Prompt: Define and evolve interoperability standards across allied systems, vendors, and classification levels. Establish STANAG/NIEM-compliant interfaces and schema mappings. Lead cross-domain data fusion design.

Questions:

Are we STIX 2.1/NIEM/Multilateral-ready?

What red/black boundary translation gaps exist?

Are we modeling classification levels and release caveats for coalition sharing?

Why: If IntelGraph aims for real-world deployment or simulation fidelity, interop with allied platforms (e.g., NATO, Five Eyes, JSOC, IC) is critical.
