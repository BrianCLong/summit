# Codex Task: Compliance Evidence Automation

**Priority:** P0/P1  
**Labels:** `compliance`, `automation`, `evidence`, `codex-task`

## Desired Outcome
Automated evidence collection and reporting pipeline supporting compliance obligations.

## Workstreams
- Map regulatory controls (FedRAMP, SOC 2, ISO 27001) to required evidence artifacts and data sources.
- Build connectors to ingest logs, configs, and attestations from Codex services and third-party platforms.
- Implement rules engine to evaluate control coverage, flag gaps, and generate auditor-ready packages.
- Deliver self-service portal workflow for compliance teams to schedule exports and monitor status.

## Key Deliverables
- Control-to-evidence data model and source inventory.
- Automated ingestion jobs with storage, retention, and tamper-evident hashing.
- Evidence automation runbook, including exception handling and manual override steps.
- Compliance dashboard widgets showing control coverage and outstanding actions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- â‰¥90% of priority controls automatically collect current evidence with timestamped provenance.
- Exported evidence bundles meet auditor format requirements (PDF/CSV manifests) and include integrity checks.
- Alerts raised within 24 hours for missing or stale evidence signals.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Access to production telemetry and configuration stores.
- Legal review of data retention and privacy implications.
- Coordination with Policy & Security Hardening workstream for control definitions.

## Milestones
- **Week 1:** Finalize control mappings and prioritize data sources.
- **Week 2-3:** Implement ingestion connectors and evidence storage.
- **Week 4:** Launch rules engine with alerting, perform pilot audit dry run.
- **Week 5:** Release self-service portal workflow and documentation.
