Prompt: Simulate threat actor TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK, MISP), inject synthetic adversarial patterns, and validate detection/modeling efficacy. Feed adversary behavior into HUMINT/CYBER/INFLUENCE graphs.

Questions:

Are current detections biased by known patterns only?

Which TTPs are least modeled in our schema?

Can we simulate blended ops (e.g., HUMINT + Influence + CYBER)?

Why: Enhances model robustness and supports real-time validation. Useful for training, wargaming, and ML evaluation.
