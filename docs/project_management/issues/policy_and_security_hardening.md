# Codex Task: Policy & Security Hardening

**Priority:** P0  
**Labels:** `security`, `policy`, `hardening`, `codex-task`

## Desired Outcome

Hardened policy enforcement and security controls rolled out across services.

## Workstreams

- Inventory existing policy enforcement points and assess coverage against GA requirements.
- Implement missing controls (OPA policies, fine-grained RBAC, rate limiting, audit logging) with automated tests.
- Conduct threat modeling and penetration testing to validate control effectiveness.
- Update security runbooks, incident response procedures, and training materials.

## Key Deliverables

- Policy coverage matrix with remediation backlog and ownership.
- Hardened policy bundles versioned with release notes and SHA references.
- Security validation report summarizing pen test, chaos, and red team findings.
- Updated runbooks, playbooks, and security awareness collateral.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All GA-tier services enforcing updated policies with passing integration and security tests.
- Critical findings from pen tests closed or risk-accepted with compensating controls.
- Policy bundles signed and pinned for release with automated drift detection.

## Dependencies & Risks

- Coordination with IGAC/Provenance governance initiative for policy bundle management.
- Availability of security tooling and test environments.
- Potential performance impact of new controls requiring tuning.

## Milestones

- **Week 1:** Complete policy coverage audit and prioritize gaps.
- **Week 2-3:** Implement remediations and expand automated security tests.
- **Week 4:** Execute validation exercises (pen test, chaos scenarios).
- **Week 5:** Finalize documentation, approvals, and release sign-off.
