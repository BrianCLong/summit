# Codex Task: Air-Gap Offline Deploy v1

**Priority:** P1  
**Labels:** `deployment`, `air-gap`, `infrastructure`, `codex-task`

## Desired Outcome

First production-ready offline deployment pattern for isolated environments with documentation.

## Workstreams

- Define air-gapped reference architecture, including network topology, package repos, and secret handling.
- Containerize and bundle required services with deterministic builds and signed artifacts.
- Develop offline installer toolkit (scripts, Terraform modules, validation checks) for infrastructure bring-up.
- Document operational guidance covering updates, patching, and incident response within disconnected environments.

## Key Deliverables

- Air-gap deployment blueprint with hardware/software prerequisites.
- Artifact mirror (OCI registry snapshot, package bundles) with checksum manifest.
- Offline deployment toolkit and automated validation report template.
- Operations manual and training materials for customer admins.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Successful end-to-end deployment executed in controlled air-gapped lab without internet access.
- Security review completed for artifact signing, key management, and supply-chain controls.
- Documentation approved by support and enablement teams for customer distribution.

## Dependencies & Risks

- Access to secure build pipeline and signing infrastructure.
- Coordination with Security for threat modeling of offline posture.
- Hardware availability to simulate customer environment.

## Milestones

- **Week 1:** Finalize architecture and component inventory.
- **Week 2-3:** Produce signed artifacts and build offline toolkit.
- **Week 4:** Execute lab deployment and remediate gaps.
- **Week 5:** Publish documentation and handoff to support/enablement.
