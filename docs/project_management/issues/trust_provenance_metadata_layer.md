Proposal: Define a universal trust/provenance ontology across all intelligence types—HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, OSINT—with time-decay, source lineage, and corroboration status.

Deliverables:

Common trust_score() function with source-class weights

Time-decayed credibility curves

Corroboration chains with links to original sensors/agents

Why: Prevents fragmentation in scoring and supports transparent, justifiable alerts and analytics. Essential for multi-INT fusion.
