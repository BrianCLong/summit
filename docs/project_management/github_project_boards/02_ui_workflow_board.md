# Project Board: User Interface & Workflow

## To Do

*   **Story:** As an analyst, I want to be able to see a visual representation of my data so that I can easily identify connections and patterns.
    *   **Task:** Implement the "Graph Explorer" UI as described in `velocity-plan-v6.md`.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The "Graph Explorer" UI is implemented with the features described in `velocity-plan-v6.md`. The UI is responsive and works on all supported browsers.
        *   **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Integrate the Cytoscape.js library for graph visualization.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The Cytoscape.js library is integrated into the React application. The graph is rendered using Cytoscape.js.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Allow users to customize the graph layout and appearance.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can change the graph layout (e.g., from force-directed to circular). Users can change the color and size of nodes and edges.
        *   **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
*   **Story:** As an analyst, I want to be able to interact with the graph to explore the data.
    *   **Task:** Allow users to pan and zoom the graph.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can pan and zoom the graph using the mouse and keyboard.
        *   **Estimate:** 2 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Allow users to click on nodes and edges to see more details.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** When a user clicks on a node or edge, a sidebar appears with more details about the selected object.
        *   **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Allow users to filter the graph based on node and edge properties.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can filter the graph based on node and edge properties (e.g., show only nodes of a certain type).
        *   **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
*   **Story:** As an analyst, I want to be able to collaborate with my team in real-time.
    *   **Task:** Implement real-time updates for the graph view.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** When a user makes a change to the graph, the change is immediately visible to all other users who are viewing the same graph.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Add presence indicators to show which users are currently active in an investigation.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** When a user is viewing a graph, their avatar is displayed on the screen. Other users can see who is currently active in the investigation.
        *   **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Implement a chat feature for real-time communication.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A chat window is added to the investigation view. Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
*   **Story:** As an analyst, I want to have a guided analysis experience so that I can be more effective in my investigations.
    *   **Task:** Implement the "Copilot" feature as described in `velocity-plan-v6.md`.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The "Copilot" feature is implemented with the features described in `velocity-plan-v6.md`. The Copilot provides users with guidance and recommendations on how to proceed with their investigation.
        *   **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Create a set of pre-defined analysis "runbooks" for common investigation scenarios.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A set of pre-defined analysis "runbooks" is created for common investigation scenarios (e.g., fraud detection, threat intelligence).
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Allow users to create their own custom runbooks.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can create their own custom runbooks using a simple drag-and-drop interface.
        *   **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
