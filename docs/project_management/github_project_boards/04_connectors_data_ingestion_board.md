# Project Board: Connectors & Data Ingestion

## To Do

- **Story:** As an analyst, I want to be able to easily import data from common file formats.
  - **Task:** Implement support for importing data from CSV, JSON, and XML files.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can import data from CSV, JSON, and XML files. The data is parsed and validated before it is ingested into the platform.
    - **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
  - **Task:** Add a user interface for mapping data from the source file to the IntelGraph schema.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** A user interface is created that allows users to map data from the source file to the IntelGraph schema. The interface is user-friendly and easy to use.
    - **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
- **Story:** As an analyst, I want to be able to connect to external data sources to enrich my data.
  - **Task:** Develop connectors for the data sources listed in `ROADMAP.md` (e.g., Have I Been Pwned, Twitter/X, VirusTotal).
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Connectors are developed for the data sources listed in `ROADMAP.md`. The connectors are tested and documented.
    - **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
  - **Task:** Create a framework for developing new connectors.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** A framework is created for developing new connectors. The framework is well-documented and easy to use.
    - **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
- **Story:** As a platform operator, I want to be able to monitor the health of the data ingestion pipeline.
  - **Task:** Add metrics and logging to the data ingestion pipeline.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Metrics and logging are added to the data ingestion pipeline. The metrics and logs are sent to the platform's monitoring and logging systems.
    - **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
  - **Task:** Create a dashboard for monitoring the status of data ingestion jobs.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** A dashboard is created for monitoring the status of data ingestion jobs. The dashboard shows the status of each job, as well as any errors that have occurred.
    - **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
