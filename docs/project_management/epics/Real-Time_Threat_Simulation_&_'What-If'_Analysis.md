# Epic: Real-Time Threat Simulation & 'What-If' Analysis

Milestone: MVP1-Simulation

Introduces the Adversarial LLM Threat Simulation Sandbox, enabling controlled exploration of AI-enabled attack chains. The sandbox orchestrates phishing, exploit development, influence operations, and supply-chain scenarios while enforcing safety governors and exhaustive logging. See [Adversarial LLM Threat Simulation Sandbox](../../ADVERSARIAL_LLM_THREAT_SIMULATION_SANDBOX.md) for the full capabilities and architecture.
