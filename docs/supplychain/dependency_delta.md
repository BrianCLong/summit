# Dependency Delta Policy

## Overview
To ensure supply chain security, any change to the project's dependencies must be documented in this file.

## Requirements
1. **Rationale**: Why is the new dependency needed?
2. **Security Review**: Has the dependency been scanned for vulnerabilities?
3. **Approval**: Has the change been approved by a Lead Engineer?
