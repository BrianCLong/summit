# Global Threat Monitoring & Adaptive Operations Architecture

This document describes the reference design for enabling global threat monitoring, red team simulation, analyst mission packaging, orchestration workflows, adaptive feedback, and compartmented security within the Intelgraph platform.

## 1. OSINT + GEOINT Integration Layer

### Data Sources

- Satellite imagery via STAC/COG endpoints
- Open crisis indicators (ACLED, UN OCHA, RSS feeds, Twitter/X)
- Existing Intelgraph entity updates and partner APIs

### Ingestion Pipeline

1. **Fetchers** pull or subscribe to external feeds on a fixed cadence.
2. Events flow through a **message queue** (Kafka/NATS) for back‑pressure control.
3. A **normalization service** converts raw items into a common schema with GeoJSON envelopes.
4. Enriched records are written to the graph store and cached in Elasticsearch for spatial queries.

### Geospatial Visualization

- Leaflet/Mapbox layer rendering entity pins, event overlays, and dynamic heatmaps.
- Timeline slider replays event evolution using cached snapshots.
- Latency target: dashboard updates within 10 seconds of source publication.

## 2. Red Teaming Simulation Engine

### Architecture

- **Scenario Library** stores adversary playbooks (phishing, disinformation, kinetic proxies).
- **Agents** can be script driven or LLM backed; each agent publishes synthetic signals into the same queue used by live feeds.
- **Control Panel** allows operators to launch scenarios, tune parameters, and review metrics.

### Evaluation

- Simulated events exercise alert thresholds and analyst workflows.
- Engine records analyst acknowledgement time and accuracy, producing readiness scores.

## 3. Analyst Mission Packaging & Export

### Packaging Flow

1. Analyst selects entities, timelines, annotations, and reports within the workspace.
2. A packaging service gathers referenced assets and builds a manifest with risk levels and tags.
3. Assets are rendered to PDF via Jinja2 templates and zipped alongside JSON metadata.
4. Optional PGP encryption wraps the archive for classified transfer.

### Output

- Single click export produces a `.zip` bundle containing:
  - `summary.pdf`
  - `metadata.json`
  - supporting attachments (imagery, reports)

## 4. Threat Ops Orchestration Framework (Stage 1)

### Workflow Mapping

- Alerts are transformed into **events** with severity, entity, and geo context.
- A lightweight rule engine maps events to workflows (e.g., high‑risk entity → open case, notify analyst).
- Initial library includes three workflows: notification, task routing, and external case creation.

### Implementation Notes

- MVP implemented in Python with Temporal or a custom async scheduler.
- Hooks exposed for later integration with enterprise case managers.

## 5. Self‑Adaptive Threat Response Feedback Loop

### Data Collection

- Each workflow execution logs duration, analyst inputs, and outcomes.
- Logs persist to a feedback store used for training and LLM evaluation.

### Adaptive Logic

- A periodic job runs an LLM or lightweight ML model to assess effectiveness of responses.
- Recommendations adjust alert thresholds or swap workflows; changes require analyst approval.

## 6. Advanced Security & Intel Labeling

### Classification Model

- Support standard markings: **U**, **C**, **S**, **TS**, plus caveats (NOFORN, REL TO).
- Operational labels (Cyber, HUMINT, FISA) stored as attributes on graph nodes and edges.

### Enforcement

- Access control middleware checks user compartments against item labels (PostgreSQL RLS + ABAC).
- Derived products inherit the highest classification of source material; export service preserves labels in metadata.

## Deliverables Summary

1. Real‑time OSINT/GEOINT dashboard.
2. Configurable red team simulation engine.
3. One‑click mission packaging with export.
4. Threat ops orchestration MVP.
5. Feedback‑driven workflow tuning logic.
6. Compartmented access control system.
