# Threat Assessment Engine Architecture

IntelGraph's Threat Assessment Engine (TAE) extends traditional Threat Detection Engine (TDE) paradigms with a multi‑domain fusion platform that spans cyber defense, intelligence operations, behavioral science, financial engineering, and enterprise‑scale IT security. This document outlines core capabilities, advanced analytics, operational integrations, and representative use‑case clusters.

## Core Functional Capabilities

- **Real‑Time Telemetry Ingestion** from network, endpoint, identity, email, IoT/OT, and cloud sources with sub‑second latency.
- **Streaming Analytics Pipeline** built on Kafka and Flink for continuous detection and adaptive scoring.
- **Behavioral & Cognitive Analytics** leveraging UEBA, psychographic profiling, and deviation modelling for insider threat and credential misuse detection.
- **AI/ML Layer** supporting supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and federated learning with XAI explanations for analyst trust.
- **Signature, Heuristic & Pattern Detection** via YARA/Snort/Suricata rules, time‑series analysis, and slow‑and‑low beaconing discovery.
- **Threat Intelligence Fusion** ingesting OSINT, commercial, and dark‑web feeds through STIX/TAXII and OpenCTI; attribution mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

## Advanced Technical Capabilities

- **Graph‑Based Correlation Engine** utilising graph databases for temporal, geographical, and entity relationship modelling.
- **High‑Throughput Data Lake Integration** (S3, Azure Blob, BigQuery) enabling petabyte‑scale retention and forensic replay.
- **Cross‑Domain Coverage** for EDR, NDR, cloud/SaaS, containers/Kubernetes, and industrial control systems with eBPF telemetry and protocol dissectors.
- **Deception & Active Defense** with honeynets, honeycreds, canary artifacts, and adaptive decoys feeding live attacker behaviour into training loops.
- **Threat Hunting & SOAR Orchestration** providing hypothesis‑driven queries, automated containment, firewall rule pushes, and ticketing integration.
- **Compliance & DLP Modules** delivering PCI‑DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001 templates, OCR‑based leakage inspection, and CASB/DRM connectors.
- **Resilience Monitoring & Simulation** measuring patch levels, misconfigurations, red/blue‑team outputs, and auto‑retraining via Caldera, Atomic Red Team, and SCYTHE simulations.
- **Cognitive Warfare & Influence Detection** identifying botnets, coordinated inauthentic behaviour, deepfake media, and sentiment manipulation using NLP and emotion analysis.
- **Cyber Deception Feedback Loops** that harvest attacker TTPs within decoys to refine predictive models and risk forecasting.

## Operational Integrations

- **API‑First Architecture** (REST/gRPC) with plugin framework and native connectors for SIEM, XDR, SOAR, EDR/NDR stacks, and third‑party data providers.
- **Multi‑Tenant Governance** supporting RBAC, data segmentation, MSSP workflows, and zero‑trust policy enforcement.
- **Dashboards & Visualization** offering real‑time heatmaps, kill‑chain timelines, attack‑surface maps, and business‑unit risk scoreboards.
- **Enterprise Readiness** through backup/restore hooks, health checks, and immutable audit trails for regulatory evidence.

## Use‑Case Clusters

### Strategic

- APT detection and attribution, nation‑state campaign monitoring, supply‑chain compromise analysis, corporate espionage tracking, and disinformation detection.

### Operational

- 24x7 SOC monitoring, insider risk management, cloud compliance auditing, MFA bypass detection, ransomware early containment, and cross‑sector threat sharing.

### Tactical

- Threat hunting and IOC sweeping, incident reconstruction, lateral‑movement tracking, malware sandbox enrichment, and adaptive network segmentation triggers.

### Emerging

- Behavioural finance fraud modelling, geopolitical risk propagation, quantum‑resistant cryptographic anomaly detection, and autonomous red‑team/blue‑team wargaming.

The TAE functions as the digital nervous system of IntelGraph, enabling continuous sensing, learning, deception, and response at global scale.
