# Summit Extension Governance

If you want to extend Summit, start here. This folder defines the governed extension model, security requirements, compatibility policy, and review checklist for extensions. Extensions are **not GA** unless explicitly stated in a GA authority file.

## Authority Sources

All extension governance is bound to the following authority files:

- `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md`
- `docs/releases/MVP-4_GA_BASELINE.md`
- `docs/releases/GA-CORE-RELEASE-NOTES.md`
- `docs/release/GA_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`
- `docs/security/SECURITY_REMEDIATION_LEDGER.md`

## Documents

- [Extension Model](EXTENSION_MODEL.md)
- [Extension Security Requirements](EXTENSION_SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- [Extension Review Checklist](EXTENSION_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [Extension Compatibility Policy](EXTENSION_COMPATIBILITY_POLICY.md)

## GA Boundary

Extensions are governed artifacts that must align to the Summit Readiness Assertion. Any deviation from the GA baseline is a **Governed Exception** and must be recorded in the extension review checklist.
