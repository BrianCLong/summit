# Ecosystem Economics (Anti-Gaming Model)

## Economic North Star

> **Partners are paid for *helpfulness over time*, not influence in the moment.**

## Allowed Revenue Models

### ✅ Quality-Weighted Usage
*   Paid per signal / recommendation
*   Multiplied by long-term accuracy score

### ✅ Subscription for Availability
*   Predictable cost
*   No per-decision incentive

### ✅ Outcome-Correlated Bonus (Delayed)
*   Paid only after verified outcomes
*   Long time horizon
*   No immediate feedback loops

## Explicitly Forbidden Models

*   ❌ **Pay-per-action**: Incentivizes unnecessary activity.
*   ❌ **Pay-for-priority**: Corrupts ranking.
*   ❌ **Success fees tied to execution**: Incentivizes risky behavior.
*   ❌ **Exclusive ranking agreements**: Corrupts objectivity.

These all corrupt decision integrity.

## How Summit Wins

*   **Decision Quality**: Ecosystem increases Summit’s decision quality.
*   **Switching Costs**: Switching costs rise (based on wisdom/history, not just data).
*   **Governance Costs**: Remain flat because governance is a constraint, not a service.

## Partner Performance Ledger

Summit tracks for each partner:
*   Accuracy over time
*   Confidence calibration
*   Bias drift
*   Adversarial susceptibility

Partners cannot edit this ledger.
