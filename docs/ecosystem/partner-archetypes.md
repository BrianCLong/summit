# Partner Archetype Design (Recommended Set)

## Guiding Principle

> **Partners should increase decision quality, not decision power.**

The first ecosystem partners must:
*   Be valuable immediately
*   Be non-threatening to authority
*   Produce measurable improvement
*   Be easy to sandbox and revoke

## Top 5 Recommended Archetypes

### 1. Threat & Risk Intelligence Providers (The First Mover)
*   **Why**: Pure signal contribution, no execution pressure, high demand.
*   **Examples**: Threat intel feeds, Fraud risk scorers.
*   **Allowed**: Signals with provenance, confidence-bounded annotations.
*   **Forbidden**: Urgency framing, prescriptive action language.

### 2. Simulation & Scenario Engines (High Value)
*   **Why**: Executive value ("what if"), no runtime authority.
*   **Contribution**: Outcome simulations, Counterfactual projections.
*   **Guardrail**: Simulations **cannot recommend actions**, only scenarios.

### 3. Compliance Mapping & Control Services (Accelerator)
*   **Why**: Accelerates audits, converts governance into ROI.
*   **Contribution**: Framework crosswalks, Control interpretations.
*   **Guardrail**: Compliance ≠ permission. Mapping never overrides policy.

### 4. ML / Analytics Recommendation Engines (Differentiation)
*   **Why**: High sophistication, differentiates Summit from static governance.
*   **Contribution**: Ranked options, Pattern detection.
*   **Guardrail**: All recommendations must include confidence bounds, assumptions, and alternatives.

### 5. Execution Tool Integrations (Last)
*   **Why**: Highest risk, commoditized.
*   **Contribution**: Execute Summit-approved commands.
*   **Guardrail**: Execution tools **never decide**, retry, or scope-expand.
