# Partner Onboarding Process

**Deliberately Slow.**

## The 4 Steps

### Step 1 — Capability Declaration

Partner submits:

- What they do
- What they assume
- What they never claim

### Step 2 — Contracted Interface

Summit generates:

- Allowed inputs
- Allowed outputs
- Enforcement points

### Step 3 — Shadow Evaluation

Partner runs in:

- Non-influential mode
- Performance tracked
- Bias measured

### Step 4 — Graduated Exposure

- Limited recommendation influence
- Never authority.

## Reference Partner Pack (Structure)

This is what we give to our first ecosystem partners.

### File Structure

```

### Key Documents for Partners

- **`ecosystem-principles.md`**: Non-negotiable truths. Summit alone decides.
- **`recommendation-contract.md`**: The required schema for inputs, assumptions, and confidence.
- **`refusal-and-revocation.md`**: The rules for being kicked out (confidence inflation, drift).
