# Ecosystem Principles

## Sprint Goal

Design an ecosystem model where:

- Partners can innovate freely
- Customers can extend safely
- Summit remains the **single authority substrate**
- Governance, evidence, and law are never diluted

This sprint reframes Summit as:

- A **constitutional platform**, not an open marketplace
- A system that enables _extensions_, not _delegation_
- Infrastructure where power is centralized, but value creation is decentralized

## Core Ecosystem Thesis

> _You can decentralize innovation without decentralizing authority._

Most ecosystems conflate the two. Summit must not.

## Ecosystem Non-Negotiables (Hard Constraints)

Before anything else, these must be explicit and enforced:

1. **No external actor may execute decisions**
2. **No plugin may bypass evidence or policy**
3. **No extension may claim authority**
4. **No partner may weaken refusal semantics**
5. **All ecosystem value must be auditable**

If an ecosystem design violates any of these, it is rejected.

## The Summit Ecosystem Manifesto

> Summit enables an ecosystem of innovation **without outsourcing authority**.

We believe:

- Decisions should be explainable
- Authority should be attributable
- Automation should be governed
- Evidence should outlive people

Therefore:

1. Summit alone decides.
2. Partners may inform, never command.
3. No ecosystem participant can bypass evidence or policy.
4. Refusal is not failure.
5. Economic incentives must not distort judgment.

We welcome partners who increase clarity.
We reject those who seek control.

This will not change.

## Why This Ecosystem Works

Because:

- Partners innovate without risk
- Customers extend without fear
- Summit remains the authority
- No future cleanup is required

Most platforms retrofit governance later.
Summit makes governance the **enabling constraint**.
