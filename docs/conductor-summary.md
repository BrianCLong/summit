# Workstream 1 — Conductor Summary

## Goals
- Deliver a single-screen Conductor control surface that unifies release orchestration, SLO guardrails, and spend tracking while remaining extensible for downstream workstreams (2–8).
- Provide actionable telemetry and evidence hooks that make the release cadence (weekly staging, biweekly prod) transparent and auditable.
- Prepare the operating model, backlog, and accountability (RACI) needed to execute the next two releases without breaching performance or cost guardrails.

## Non-goals
- Implementing underlying service code changes or infrastructure migrations (covered in Workstreams 2–8).
- Redesigning Maestro UI navigation beyond the targeted one-screen summary experience.
- Modifying organizational staffing levels or budget allocations outside the stated guardrails.

## Assumptions
- Downstream workstreams (2–8) will expose APIs/telemetry endpoints compatible with the evidence hooks defined here.
- Current CI/CD tooling supports trunk-based development, tagging, and automatic promotions to staging and production on schedule.
- Security and compliance baselines remain unchanged during the two-release window.

## Constraints
- **Performance guardrails:** API reads p95 ≤ 350 ms, API writes p95 ≤ 700 ms, subscriptions p95 ≤ 250 ms, Neo4j 1-hop p95 ≤ 300 ms, Neo4j 2–3 hop p95 ≤ 1 200 ms.
- **Cost guardrails:** Dev ≤ $1 000/mo, Staging ≤ $3 000/mo, Prod ≤ $18 000/mo, LLM spend ≤ $5 000/mo with 80 % alert thresholds.
- **Cadence guardrails:** Trunk-based development with weekly cut to staging, biweekly to production, semantic tags `vX.Y.Z`.
- **Evidence guardrails:** All deliverables must emit logs, metrics, automated test artifacts, and provenance metadata to satisfy auditability.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing or inconsistent telemetry from dependent workstreams blocks evidence roll-up. | High | Medium | Drive integration contracts and automated schema validation (Story WS1-S1, Task WS1-S1-T2). | Data PM |
| Cost guardrails breached before alerts trigger due to incomplete budget instrumentation. | High | Medium | Define budget alert spec and integrate with FinOps dashboards (Story WS1-S2, Task WS1-S2-T1). | SRE Lead |
| Release cadence slips because RACI and milestones are unclear across teams. | Medium | Medium | Publish week-level RACI and integrate with CI governance checklist (Story WS1-S3, Task WS1-S3-T1). | Dev Lead |
| UI single-screen summary becomes overloaded and unusable. | Medium | Low | Apply focused scope with UX validation checklist and usability tests (Story WS1-S4, Task WS1-S4-T3). | Docs/UX Lead |

## Definition of Done
- Conductor summary one-pager approved by Dev, Sec, SRE, Data, and Docs leads with signed-off risks/mitigations.
- Prioritized backlog (epics → stories → tasks) stored in `backlog/backlog.json`, including MoSCoW priority, acceptance criteria, verification steps, dependencies on Workstreams 2–8, and evidence hooks for logs/metrics/tests/provenance.
- RACI matrix in `docs/raci.md` published with week-level milestones aligned to trunk-based release cadence.
- Evidence instrumentation plan documented (per story) ensuring telemetry, alerting, automated tests, and provenance artifacts can be collected.
- Stakeholder review checklist completed and archived with links to the backlog and RACI.
