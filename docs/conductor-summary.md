# Conductor Summary — Release N+1

## Goal
- Develop a powerful Python-based policy fuzzer that generates adversarial policy and query pairs, integrates with GitHub Actions, and evolves towards state-of-the-art vulnerability detection.

## Non-Goals
- Full integration with all possible real-world policy languages (e.g., OPA Rego, Cedar) in this release.
- Automated remediation of identified policy vulnerabilities.

## Assumptions
- Policies can be represented in a structured format (e.g., YAML).
- Queries can be represented as key-value pairs.
- Basic governance layers (consent, geo, licenses, retention, time_window) are defined.

## Constraints
- SLOs: API reads p95 ≤ 350 ms; writes p95 ≤ 700 ms; subs p95 ≤ 250 ms.
- Graph ops: 1-hop p95 ≤ 300 ms; 2–3 hop p95 ≤ 1,200 ms.
- Cost: Dev ≤ $1k/mo; Stage ≤ $3k/mo; Prod ≤ $18k/mo; LLM ≤ $5k/mo; alert at 80%.
- Cadence: trunk-based; weekly cut → staging; biweekly → prod; tags vX.Y.Z.

## Risks & Mitigations
- [ ] Risk: Policy fuzzer generates too many false positives, leading to alert fatigue.
  Mitigation: Continuously refine oracle and metamorphic relations to reduce false positives; implement severity and impact scoring.
- [ ] Risk: Fuzzer misses critical policy bypasses due to limited attack grammar sophistication.
  Mitigation: Continuously expand and enhance attack grammars, including novel evasion techniques.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All AC met with evidence (tests, metrics, logs, provenance)
- [ ] SLO/cost burn ≤ thresholds
- [ ] Runbooks and dashboards updated
- [ ] Policy fuzzer integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Comprehensive HTML reports generated with severity and impact analysis
