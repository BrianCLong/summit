# Maestro Conductor – Workstream 1 Summary

## Goals
- Deliver a single-screen Conductor control summary that translates product intent into actionable guardrails, backlog, and accountability for the next two releases.
- Embed observability hooks for SLO, cost, and cadence guardrails so downstream workstreams inherit unified targets.
- Provide release-ready backlog and RACI assets that align with trunk-based delivery and weekly/biweekly cut cadence.

## Non-Goals
- Implementing Workstreams 2–8 deliverables (only referencing dependencies and evidence requirements).
- Changing existing runtime infrastructure or deployment tooling beyond instrumentation called out in this workstream.
- Redefining org-wide governance beyond cost/SLO guardrails supplied above.

## Assumptions
- Core Maestro Conductor architecture and integrations defined in prior PRDs remain valid.
- Telemetry stack (Grafana/Prometheus, Neo4j query tracing, billing exporter) is available for new evidence hooks.
- Workstreams 2–8 will consume the backlog dependencies defined here without schedule slippage.

## Constraints
- **SLO Guardrails:** API reads p95 ≤ 350 ms, writes p95 ≤ 700 ms; subscriptions p95 ≤ 250 ms; Neo4j 1-hop p95 ≤ 300 ms and 2–3 hop p95 ≤ 1200 ms.
- **Cost Guardrails:** Dev ≤ $1k/mo, Staging ≤ $3k/mo, Prod ≤ $18k/mo (LLM spend ≤ $5k/mo) with 80% alert threshold.
- **Release Cadence:** Trunk-based development; weekly cut to staging, biweekly to production; semantic tags `vX.Y.Z`.
- **Evidence Hooks:** All backlog items must emit logs, metrics, automated tests, and provenance breadcrumbs for audit.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Telemetry gaps prevent SLO verification | Medium | Instrument GraphQL resolvers and Neo4j driver with p95 histograms; validate dashboards before release gates. | SRE Lead |
| Cost telemetry delayed from FinOps exporter | High | Integrate cost collector mock in Dev/Staging, set 80% alert automation, escalate to Workstream 6 (Cost Automation) if variance persists. | Data Lead |
| Dependencies from Workstream 3 (Data model) slip | Medium | Align milestone syncs weekly; adjust backlog with contingency tasks for schema contract tests. | Dev Lead |
| Security review lags ahead of biweekly prod release | Medium | Pre-book Sec sign-off in week 3; include threat model delta checklist task. | Sec Lead |
| Documentation debt blocks go/no-go approval | Low | Create Docs review tasks per release with automated link checking and template compliance. | Docs Lead |

## Definition of Done
- Conductor Summary, backlog JSON, and RACI published in repo with traceable evidence hook references.
- Guardrail instrumentation requirements enumerated and linked to verification procedures for both releases.
- Risks assigned with owners and mitigations tracked in backlog tasks.
- Release 1 and Release 2 milestones mapped to RACI responsibilities with status dashboards referenced.
- Automated validation (lint/JSON schema check) added for backlog structure and executed in CI or documented in verification steps.
- Sign-offs captured via provenance log entries referencing commits/tags per release.
