# Wave 1 provisionals (90-day plan)

Scope the first filings around the highest-value roadmap items:

1. **Graph-aware copilot traversal with risk budgets**

- LLM-guided graph query generation that blends vector + structured search, with per-query risk/latency budgets.
- Variants: GPU-aware planning; timeline+graph workspace interactions; redact-on-read for sensitive nodes.

2. **HE + ZK federated training loop**

- Homomorphic encrypted gradient aggregation with zero-knowledge proof of correct computation and DP noise injection.
- Variants: modality fusion over encrypted embeddings; HE result caching; Tendermint-backed federation state sync.

3. **Air-gapped, 5-minute signed installer**

- Deterministic, offline-first installer with sealed bootstraps, SBOM/SLSA attestations, and offline model/package cache warmup.
- Variants: rollback-safe mirror choreography; policy-driven egress deny; GPU artifact pinning for copilot.

4. (Optional if capacity) **GPU-aware graph inference scheduler**

- Budgeted scheduling for graph inference + copilot workloads with p95 UI latency targets (<300ms common ops).

## Filing cadence (first 90 days)

- **Week 1–2:** harvest sessions, finalize invention disclosures, assign drafting owners and counsel POCs.
- **Week 3–6:** draft and file 3–4 provisionals; capture diagrams/benchmarks; store artifacts in evidence bundle.
- **Week 7–10:** add continuation angles (dependent claim ideas) and international PCT decision notes.
- **Week 11–12:** readiness review for non-provisional/PCT paths; update docket dates and owners.
