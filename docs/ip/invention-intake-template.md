# Invention Disclosure Intake (Summit/IntelGraph)

Use this form when capturing patentable or defensive-publication candidates aligned to the active Summit/IntelGraph roadmap.

## Submission metadata
- **Title / short name**
- **Date submitted**
- **Submitter(s) / contact**
- **Priority** (P0/P1/P2) and **target filing path** (provisional, defensive publication, trade secret)

## Epic / milestone alignment
- Link to roadmap epic(s): air-gapped baseline, secure LLM/graph copilot, federation/ingestion mesh, offline/edge kit, graph+timeline UI.
- Phase (Foundation / Pilot / Scale) and target quarter.

## Component and deployment surface
- Component area: graph engine, copilot, federation/FL, edge installer, marketplace/plugin, provenance/audit.
- Deployment modes: cloud, on-prem, air-gapped/edge; dependencies (GPU, DB, message bus).

## Technical description (patent-ready)
- Problem statement and current limitation.
- Core inventive step (what is new vs known art).
- Architecture/flow summary (one paragraph) and diagrams/sequence links.
- Algorithms, data structures, thresholds/parameters (include pseudocode if available).
- Performance/security/privacy advantages (quant or modeled).

## Claims sketch (optional but recommended)
- Primary claim (broadest reasonable).
- Dependent variations (e.g., GPU-aware scheduling, DP budget governance, HE/MPC variant, offline fallback).
- Embodiments: server-side, client/edge, hybrid.

## Prior art + FTO notes
- Known papers/patents/repos and why this differs.
- Libraries/protocols reused (licensing notes: MIT/Apache/BSD/GPL).
- Risks or blocking claims to investigate.

## Security, compliance, and data handling
- Data classifications touched (PII, classified, export-controlled).
- Privacy posture (DP/HE/MPC/ZK), auditability, provenance logging.
- Export-control considerations (ITAR/EAR) and geo-scoping if any.

## Readiness and timelines
- Prototype availability (link to branch/PR).
- Filing readiness (now / <30 days / needs research).
- Owners: drafting, review (counsel), supporting engineers.

## Attachments
- Diagrams, benchmarks, threat models, proofs (ZK/HE), notebooks, test results.
