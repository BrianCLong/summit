# Continuation Pack B: Robustness/Red-team Family

## Independent Claim: Adversarial Robustness Scoring and Policy-Gated Evaluation

1. A computer-implemented system for evaluating the robustness of misinformation defense actions, comprising:
   - one or more processors configured to:
     - generate a set of adversarial counter-narrative scenarios using a red-team agent;
     - execute counterfactual simulations of candidate defense actions against the adversarial counter-narrative scenarios;
     - compute a robustness score for each candidate defense action based on the counterfactual simulations; and
     - gate the activation of the red-team agent and the execution of defense actions based on governance policies.
