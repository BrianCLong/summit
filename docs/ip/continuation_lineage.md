# Continuation Pack A: Lineage Family

## Independent Claim: Source Lineage Graph and Audit Export

1. A computer-implemented method for managing data provenance in an adversarial misinformation defense platform, the method comprising:
   - constructing a source lineage graph linking ingested content items to derived narrative states in a narrative operating graph;
   - tracking derivation transformations applied to the ingested content items;
   - applying redaction rules to sensitive fields within the source lineage graph; and
   - generating an audit export comprising a lineage manifest bound to a snapshot hash of the narrative operating graph.
