# Specification Support Paragraphs

The following text provides enablement and descriptive support for the core innovations described in the additional claims clusters.

## 1. Lineage Graph Construction and Manifest Generation
The system implements a multi-layer lineage tracking mechanism that automatically records the derivation of every narrative state. When a content item is ingested, the system generates a `source record` with cryptographic binding to the origin. As the `narrative operating graph` evolves, each transformation (e.g., entity extraction, clustering, or LLM-based summarization) is recorded as a `lineage node` with directed edges linking back to parent nodes. A `lineage manifest` is dynamically constructed for each candidate defense action by traversing the graph backwards to collect all contributing sources and transformation identifiers. This manifest is then hashed (`lineage hash`) and recorded in the audit log, ensuring that any external action can be traced back to its specific evidence base.

## 2. Evidence-Based Attestations for Supply-Chain Discipline
To ensure the integrity of the AI supply chain, the system treats governance policies, models, and tools as immutable `versioned bundles`. Before any bundle can be used in a production environment, it must have a corresponding `attestation record`. This record contains a digital signature over the `bundle hash` by an authorized signer. The `policy engine` enforces a strict requirement where any defense action referencing a non-attested tool or model version is denied execution. This mechanism prevents the accidental or malicious introduction of unvetted components into the defense pipeline.

## 3. Red-Team Simulation Boundaries and Robustness Scoring
The platform includes an automated `red-team agent` designed to stress-test defense actions by generating `adversarial counter-narrative scenarios`. These scenarios represent sophisticated attempts to reframe or subvert the platform's defense narrative. To prevent the red-team agent from inadvertently causing real-world harm, the system enforces a `simulation boundary`: red-team generated content is tagged with a `simulate-only` flag that is checked by the `execution interface`. Absent an explicit human-granted approval token, any attempt by an adversarial generator to write to a live execution connector is blocked. Robustness is quantified by evaluating defense performance across a wide set of these simulated scenarios, resulting in a `robustness score` used for ranking and gating.

## 4. Staged Rollouts and Rollback with Audit Binding
Updates to transition functions and policy bundles follow a `staged rollout` protocol. New versions are first deployed to a `test environment` where they are validated against historical benchmarks. The transition to the `production environment` is gated by validation metrics (e.g., trust impact accuracy, latency, error rates). If a metric degrades beyond a predefined threshold post-rollout, the system automatically triggers a `rollback` using a pre-recorded `rollback plan identifier`. Every event in this lifecycle—from version changes to rollout milestones and rollback triggers—is recorded in the append-only `audit log` and linked to the specific policy decisions made during that period, ensuring complete accountability.
