# Continuation Pack C: Supply-chain Family

## Independent Claim: Policy Bundle Attestation and Staged Rollout

1. A computer-implemented system for governing updates to an adversarial misinformation defense platform, comprising:
   - one or more processors configured to:
     - verify an attestation record for a versioned bundle comprising at least one of a policy, a model, and a tool;
     - enforce a staged rollout of the versioned bundle across a plurality of environments based on validation metrics;
     - monitor the validation metrics for degradation beyond a threshold;
     - execute a rollback to a previous versioned bundle based on a rollback plan identifier; and
     - record bundle version changes and rollout events in an audit log bound to evidence artifacts.
