# Filing Strategy for Continuation Moats (v1)

This document outlines the recommended filing strategy for the recently drafted jurisdiction-aware, forecast-driven, and partner-governed claims.

## 1. Claim Subsets

To optimize for both breadth of protection and speed of allowance, the following subsets are identified:

### 1.1 Broad (The Moat)
Focus on the independent claims:
- **CRM:** C360.1 (Jurisdiction/Geofence), C360.2 (Forecasting/Drift), C360.3 (Partner Overlays).
- **Apparatus:** S360.1 (Jurisdiction/Geofence), S360.2 (Forecasting/Drift), S360.3 (Partner Overlays).
*Strategic value:* These establish the high-level architectural requirements for a governed AI defense platform.

### 1.2 Medium (The Workflow)
Focus on specific enforcement and transition logic:
- **Jurisdiction:** C362–C365 / S362–S365 (Constraint evaluation and geofence denial).
- **Forecasting:** C374–C376 / S374–S376 (Drift detection and transition to monitoring-only).
- **Overlays:** C384–C385 / S384–S385 (Conflict resolution and restrictive-only enforcement).
*Strategic value:* These provide "technical effect" anchors that are harder to invalidate over prior art.

### 1.3 Narrow (The Evidence)
Focus on specific audit artifacts and rationale generation:
- **Rationale:** C370 / S370 (Jurisdiction rationale artifact).
- **Drift Evidence:** C375 / S375 (Drift artifact linkage).
- **Compliance:** C390 / S390 (Partner compliance report).
*Strategic value:* These facilitate easier infringement detection through inspection of system audit logs.

## 2. Recommended Continuation Family

The **Defense CRM** family (C-series) is recommended for the quickest prosecution path.

### 2.1 Technical Effect Emphasis
The CRM claims focus on the "governed medium" and the specific instructions for policy enforcement. This approach emphasizes the transformation of content and the securing of execution interfaces, which aligns well with patentability requirements for "technical solutions to technical problems."

### 2.2 Functional Specificity
The geofencing and partner overlay clusters provide concrete technical constraints on digital publishing and execution connectors. These are highly defensible as they relate to the security and integrity of the communication channel—a traditional area of technical patentability.

## 3. Prosecution Guidance

- **Priority:** Lead with the **Jurisdiction/Geofence** cluster. Geofencing is a well-established technical concept, and its application to AI-driven defense actions provides a clear, non-obvious improvement in system safety.
- **Defense against "Abstract Idea" rejections:** Emphasize the **binding** of decisions to cryptographic hashes (snapshot hash, policy bundle hash) and the mechanical enforcement of restrictive overlays, which moves the invention from "policy making" to "mechanical execution under constraint."
