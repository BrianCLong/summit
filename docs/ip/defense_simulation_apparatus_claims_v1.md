# ADDITIONAL DEPENDENT CLAIMS — SIMULATION APPARATUS (S91–S120)

S1. A simulation apparatus for evaluating adversarial misinformation defense actions, comprising:
- a memory storing instructions and a narrative operating graph representing narrative states derived from source records;
- one or more processors configured to execute the instructions to:
  - receive a plurality of candidate defense actions;
  - execute a counterfactual simulation of each candidate defense action within a simulated environment to predict a trust impact metric;
  - rank the plurality of candidate defense actions based on the predicted trust impact metric and a set of governance policies;
  - record a replay manifest for the counterfactual simulation, the replay manifest being bound to a snapshot hash of the narrative operating graph; and
  - output a permitted defense action based on the ranking for execution by an execution interface.

## Cluster 1: Lineage-aware simulation inputs (S91–S100)

S91. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus receives a lineage manifest for each candidate defense action, the lineage manifest referencing source records and transformation identifiers contributing to the candidate defense action.
S92. The apparatus of claim S91, wherein the apparatus computes a lineage hash over the lineage manifest and includes the lineage hash in the replay manifest.
S93. The apparatus of claim S91, wherein the apparatus denies ranking a candidate defense action above monitoring-only actions when the lineage manifest lacks required source records.
S94. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus conditions predicted trust impact on a reliability score stored in source records referenced by the lineage manifest.
S95. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus increases predicted uncertainty for impact metrics when a fraction of sources referenced by the lineage manifest are below a reliability threshold.
S96. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus outputs, for each ranked action, a structured explanation identifying at least one source category contributing to the ranking.
S97. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus stores transformation identifiers and tool/model version identifiers used for simulation in the replay manifest.
S98. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus supports selecting among multiple snapshots and selects a snapshot set whose sources satisfy a minimum reliability constraint.
S99. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus records a redaction manifest associated with simulation inputs in an audit log excluding never-log fields.
S100. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus outputs a “lineage completeness score” and uses the score as a ranking constraint.

## Cluster 2: Adversarial red-team simulation + robustness scoring (S101–S110)

S101. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein executing the counterfactual simulation comprises simulating one or more adversarial counter-narrative scenarios generated by a red-team agent.
S102. The apparatus of claim S101, wherein the red-team agent is restricted to generating scenarios for simulation and is denied access to the execution interface absent an approval token.
S103. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus computes a robustness score for each candidate defense action based on performance across a set of adversarial counter-narrative scenarios.
S104. The apparatus of claim S103, wherein the apparatus ranks candidate defense actions using the robustness score as a hard constraint that excludes actions below a threshold.
S105. The apparatus of claim S101, wherein the apparatus simulates adversarial reframing by applying transformation operators that alter implied context while preserving lexical overlap metrics.
S106. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus outputs, for each candidate defense action, an adversarial response likelihood and an explanation identifying contributing coordination indicators or technique labels.
S107. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus re-simulates modified candidate defense actions produced by modify decisions to improve robustness score.
S108. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus records adversarial scenario identifiers, scenario versions, and red-team agent versions in the replay manifest.
S109. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein calibration updates are prohibited for adversarial scenarios unless explicitly approved by governance policies.
S110. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus outputs a robustness regression alert when robustness scores degrade across successive bundle versions.

## Cluster 3: Supply-chain controls for simulation components (S111–S120)

S111. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein transition functions, simulation parameters, and policy bundles are stored as versioned bundles each having a bundle identifier and a bundle hash.
S112. The apparatus of claim S111, wherein the apparatus requires an attestation record for a bundle hash prior to using the bundle in simulation or ranking.
S113. The apparatus of claim S112, wherein the attestation record includes a signer identifier and a signature over the bundle hash.
S114. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the replay manifest includes bundle hashes for transition functions and governance policies used to produce ranked outputs.
S115. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus denies producing an output permitted defense action when required bundle hashes are missing from the replay manifest.
S116. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus performs staged rollout of updated transition function bundles and restricts use of the updated bundles to a test environment prior to production ranking.
S117. The apparatus of claim S116, wherein the apparatus enables production ranking with an updated bundle only after validation metrics satisfy thresholds stored in governance policies.
S118. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus maintains a rollback point for transition function parameters and reverts to the rollback point when validation metrics degrade beyond a threshold.
S119. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus records bundle version changes, staged rollout events, and rollback events in an append-only audit log linked to ranked outputs.
S120. The apparatus of claim S1, wherein the apparatus digitally signs ranked outputs or a permitted defense action output with a cryptographic identifier linking to snapshot hash and bundle hashes.
