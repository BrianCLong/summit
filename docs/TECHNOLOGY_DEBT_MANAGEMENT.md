                     10. ## What is Technology Debt

                     11. ### Definition and Impact

                     12. Technology debt is the implied cost of development choices that prioritize speed or convenience over long-term maintainability. It accumulates when teams:
                     13. - Use temporary workarounds instead of permanent solutions
                         - - Skip refactoring when requirements change
                           - - Defer critical upgrades and dependencies
                             - - Lack proper documentation
                               - - Avoid addressing architectural limitations
                                 - - Tolerate performance degradation
                                   - - Maintain legacy systems alongside modern ones

                                     - ### Why It Matters

                                     - **Financial Impact:**
                                     - - Increased development velocity costs (slower feature delivery)
                                       - - Higher bug rates and support costs
                                         - - Increased system outage risk
                                           - - Hiring and retention challenges

                                             - **Technical Impact:**
                                             - - Slower feature delivery (velocity decline)
