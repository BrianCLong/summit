                  9. ## Core Concepts

                  10. ### Capacity Definition

                  11. **Available Capacity** = (Team Size × Hours per Sprint × Utilization Rate) - Overhead

                  12. **Components:**
                  13. - **Team Size**: Total engineering headcount
                      - - **Hours per Sprint**: Working hours per 2-week sprint
                        - - **Utilization Rate**: Percentage of time spent on productive work (typically 70-80%)
                          - - **Overhead**: Code review, meetings, interruptions, training (typically 20-30%)

                            - ### Utilization vs. Velocity

                            - **Utilization:** Percentage of time spent working
                            - - Target: 70-80% (sustainable)
                              - - Warning: >85% (burnout risk)
                                - - Crisis: >90% (unsustainable)

                                  - **Velocity:** Story points or features completed per sprint
                                  - - Driven by team experience, clarity of requirements, tooling
                                    - - Not driven by working longer hours
                                      - - Burnout decreases velocity over time

                                        - ### The Capacity Trap

                                        - Teams running at 100% utilization for extended periods experience:
                                        - - Quality degradation (rushing leads to bugs)
                                          - - Knowledge loss (no time for learning)
                                            - - Tech debt accumulation (no refactoring time)
                                              - - Burnout and attrition
                                                - - Velocity decline (counterintuitive but inevitable)

                                                  - **Sustainable Model:** 70-80% utilization allows for:
                                                  - - 15-20% buffer for unexpected issues
                                                    - - 10% for continuous improvement/refactoring
                                                      - - Better focus and code quality
                                                        - - Sustainable long-term velocity

                                                          - ---

                                                          ## Capacity Assessment

                                                          ### Team Capacity Matrix

                                                          **For Each Team, Calculate:**

                                                          ```
                                                          Team: [TEAM_NAME]
                                                          Headcount: [NUMBER]
                                                          Sprint Duration: 2 weeks (80 hours per person)

                                                          Raw Hours Available = 8 people × 80 hours = 640 hours

                                                          Utilization Adjustments:
                                                          - Meetings/Administration: -15% = -96 hours

                                                          - Vacation/Sick/PTO: -10% = -64 hours

                                                          Net Available Capacity = 352 hours (55% utilization)

                                                          Recommended Allocation:
                                                          - New Features: 60% = 211 hours
                                                          - Bug Fixes/Support: 20% = 70 hours
                                                          - Technical Debt: 15% = 53 hours
                                                          - Experiments/Exploration: 5% = 18 hours
                                                          ```

                                                          ### Skill-Based Capacity
