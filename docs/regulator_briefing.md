**To our Regulatory Partners:**

This platform is designed to be natively compliant. We do not treat compliance as an afterthought.

## Key Features
1.  **Auditable by Default:** Every action is logged with cryptographic integrity.
2.  **Policy as Code:** Regulations are encoded in `policy/opa` and enforced on every request.
3.  **Transparency:** Our governance documents are public.
