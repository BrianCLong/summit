# Standard of Behavior

This document outlines the expected behavior standards for the Summit organization, aligning with our commitment to a culture where everyone can thrive.

## Core Principles

1. **Trust and Safety**: We prioritize psychological safety. Everyone should feel safe to take risks and admit mistakes.
2. **Fairness and Consistency**: Leadership actions must be predictable and fair.
3. **Growth Mindset**: We treat minor behavioral issues as opportunities for learning and course correction.

## Handling Toxic Behavior

Toxic behavior (e.g., bullying, persistent negativity, undermining peers) must be addressed immediately.

- **Minor cases**: Addressed via coaching and 1:1 learning loops.
- **Severe cases**: Escalated immediately to ensuring organizational safety.

## Addressing Bias and Microaggressions

We are proactive in identifying and challenging bias.

- **Microaggressions** should not be ignored; they should be addressed with care and educational intent.
- **Consistency** in addressing these behaviors is key to building an inclusive environment.

## Incident Response

All behavioral incidents must follow the [Incident Workflow](../../policies/people_thrive/incident_workflow.yml).
The goal is resolution that preserves trust while maintaining high standards of conduct.
