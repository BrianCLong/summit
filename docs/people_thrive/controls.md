## Controls Extraction

| Control Name                      | Intent                                                                                                  | Scope                                              | Measurable Signal                                                 | Failure Mode                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Learning Loops**                | Foster continuous growth and adaptability through structured 1:1s and objectives.                       | All team members and managers.                     | Presence of personal development goals in 1:1 records/reviews.    | Stagnation, skill gap, reduced innovation.               |
| **Resilience & Adaptability**     | Create space for experimentation, recovery, and soft skill development (C.A.P.S.).                      | Organizational culture and individual development. | Inclusion of resilience-focused objectives in performance plans.  | Burnout, fragility under pressure, fear of failure.      |
| **Support Networks**              | Provide outlets for connection, reflection, and peer support.                                           | Employee communities and staff networks.           | Active participation in and existence of staff communities.       | Isolation, reduced collaboration, high attrition.        |
| **Behavior Standards & Response** | Build trust through fair, consistent, and rapid response to toxic behavior, bias, and microaggressions. | All workplace interactions and incident handling.  | Documented incident triage and resolution according to standards. | Trust erosion, psychological safety loss, toxic culture. |

## Practice Mapping

### 1. Learning Loops

- **Practice**: Personal development goals in 1:1s.
- **Reference**: Matthew Card: "I often support this in 1:1s and reviews by helping team members set personal development goals."
- **Summit Implementation**: `docs/people_thrive/templates/1to1_growth.md`.

### 2. Resilience & Adaptability (C.A.P.S.)

- **Practice**: Teaching and modeling Confidence, Adaptability, Purposefulness, and Social Support.
- **Reference**: Card's C.A.P.S. framing for resilience.
- **Summit Implementation**: `docs/people_thrive/templates/resilience_objectives.md`.

### 3. Support Networks

- **Practice**: Creating staff communities for peer connection.
- **Reference**: "I’ve also helped create and support employee communities and networks."
- **Summit Implementation**: `docs/people_thrive/templates/team_support_networks.md`.

### 4. Behavior Standards & Response

- **Practice**: Addressing toxic behavior immediately and consistently.
- **Reference**: "You have to address toxic behaviour, ideally immediately when it happens."
- **Summit Implementation**: `policies/people_thrive/behavior_standards.yml` and `incident_workflow.yml`.
