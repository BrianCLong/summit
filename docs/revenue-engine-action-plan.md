# Revenue Engine Activation Plan

## Objectives and Guardrails
- Stand up a repeatable go-to-market motion that can be run in weekly sprints.
- Anchor on clear ICPs, a standard paid pilot, and repeatable outreach into named accounts.
- Keep every workstream measurable with owners, deadlines, and exit criteria.

## Workstream Details
### 1) ICPs & Named Accounts
- **Segments:** Gov/Defense/Intel (mission intel, J2/J3, OSINT/all-source; innovation units DIU/AFWERX/AAL/SOCOM/IWRP), Primes/SIs (Booz, SAIC, Leidos, CACI, RTX, L3Harris, mid-tier defense analytics SIs), Regulated Enterprise (FSI threat intel/fraud; energy/critical infra security/IR), NGOs/Think Tanks/Journalism (disinfo, risk, sanctions, conflict analysis).
- **Actions (Week 0–1):**
  - Build Top 100: 25 accounts per segment with primary buyer persona (titles) and 1–2 named contacts.
  - Track fields: Segment, Sub-segment, City/State, Deployment preference, Data sensitivity, Signal notes, Primary data sources, ICP fit score, Contact opt-in.
  - Owner: CEO/Head of Sales + CRM Owner. Output: "Summit Named Accounts v1" sheet and mirrored CRM entries.

### 2) Standard Paid Pilot Offer
- **Pitch (one-liner):** "6–10 week paid pilot for 1–2 teams to ship 1–2 workflows (e.g., OSINT fusion or investigation/threat intel) with policy-gated AI, provenance, and decision workshop to move to production."
- **Delivery plan:**
  - Week 0–1: use-case definition, data access, security review.
  - Weeks 2–6: build and iterate workflows in Summit (tri-pane UI, NL→Cypher, connectors, provenance/audit).
  - Weeks 7–8/10: evaluation, decision workshop, production proposal.
- **Success criteria:** 3–5 measurable goals (e.g., 50% faster time-to-answer on target investigation; 80% analysts self-serving NL→Cypher; complete provenance/audit trail across AI-assisted outputs).
- **Pricing:**
  - Gov/prime: fixed pilot fee (e.g., $75–150k) with defined production licensing path.
  - Commercial/NGO: tiered by seats/use cases with pilot credit toward production.
- **Artifacts:** 2–3 line pilot blurb for emails and 1-page Pilot SOW template (Owner: CEO + Finance/Ops; Due: Week 0–1).

### 3) Core Assets (this week → next)
- **Gov capability statement (1-pager):** who we are, core capabilities (provenance, tri-pane UI, policy-gated AI), deployment/compliance posture (CMMC journey, FedRAMP path, SBOM/SLSA stance), NAICS/PSC, DUNS/CAGE (if applicable), POCs.
- **Commercial one-pager:** problem → solution → value for regulated enterprise/NGO.
- **Executive deck (6–8 slides):** problem, "what Summit is" visual, 3–4 value pillars, 2–3 use cases/ICP, deployment/compliance, pilot offer + next steps.
- **Technical/value deep dive (12–20 slides):** architecture, connectors, graph model, provenance/audit, access control, evals, integration options, security/compliance details.
- **Owner:** CEO for content; designer/PM/Sales Ops for polish. **Due:** Week 0–1 for v1 ready-to-use assets.

### 4) Outbound Engine (start now; refine weekly)
- **CRM stages:** Target → Contacted → Meeting → Pilot Discussion → Pilot Active → Production.
- **Sequences per ICP/persona (3 emails + LinkedIn):**
  - Email 1: Insight + problem framing + 15–20 min ask.
  - Email 2: Short case-style example or demo GIF/description.
  - Email 3: Direct ask (e.g., "Worth a quick 15 to see if this can reduce <X> for your team?").
- **Activity targets:** 10–15 highly tailored outreaches per segment/week (40–60 total). Goal: 3–5 new first meetings/week.
- **Owner:** CEO + SDR/outreach support. **Output:** outreach library by ICP/role and weekly metrics (touches, replies, meetings, pilots in discussion).

### 5) Government & Prime Capture
- **Targets:** pick 3–5 programs/paths (2–3 mission programs in intel/SOF/J2/J3; 1–2 innovation paths such as DIU/AFWERX/IWRP; 2–3 prime capture threads using Summit as graph/AI substrate).
- **Capture brief template (1 page each):** mission need (their words), funding line/vehicle, timeline, stakeholders (PM/KO/tech/influencers), incumbent/competition, fast-path options (OTA/CSO/BAA/teaming), differentiators vs status quo, first-contact plan.
- **Owner:** CEO + Gov Capture Lead. **Due:** Week 1 with initial stakeholder map and contact plan.

### 6) Compliance & Evidence Bundle (this month)

- **Owner:** Security/Eng Lead + CEO. **Due:** Week 2; stored as a single link/folder referenced in CRM and proposals.

### 7) Product ↔ GTM Feedback Loop (ongoing)
- **Tracker fields per opp/pilot:** top 3 feature gaps, severity (deal-blocker/strong win/nice-to-have), estimated $ impact, status, owner, ETA/next review date.
- **Cadence:** weekly sync (15–30 min) to confirm what is committed/deferred/out-of-scope with expected dates so messaging stays accurate.
- **Owner:** CEO + Product Lead. **Output:** shared tracker and weekly Top 5 product asks with revenue impact.

## Immediate Checklist (This Week)
1. Draft v1 ICPs + Top 100 accounts and import to CRM/sheet.
2. Finalize 8-week paid pilot offer (gov + commercial variants) and email-ready blurb.
3. Produce v1 assets: gov capability 1-pager, commercial one-pager, exec deck outline, technical/value deep-dive outline.
4. Stand up CRM pipeline stages and fields; ensure owners assigned.
5. Write 3-email + LinkedIn sequences for: gov/defense mission lead, prime/SI BD lead, enterprise threat intel/fraud leader.
6. Send 10–20 tailored outreaches using available assets.
7. Identify 3–5 gov/prime targets and complete capture briefs to at least 60% fidelity.

## Reporting & Metrics
- **Weekly rollup:** touches, replies, meetings booked, pilots proposed, pilots active, production deals, time-in-stage, win/loss reasons.
- **Quality checks:** % outreaches personalized, % pilots with defined success metrics, time-to-first-value inside pilots, product requests tied to revenue.
- **Dashboards:** use CRM views for segment coverage, pipeline by stage, pilot throughput, and feature-ask revenue impact.

## Templates & Storage
- **File locations:** store assets under `/sales-assets/{gov,commercial}/` (or shared drive equivalent) with version/date stamps; link from CRM records.
- **Shared sheets:** Top 100 accounts, capture briefs, outreach library, and product-feedback tracker should each have owners and backup location (Drive/Notion/Sheets/Airtable/HubSpot custom object).

## Forward-Leaning Enhancements
- Add lightweight scoring model (fit + intent + engagement) to prioritize weekly outbound; feed signals from opens/replies and third-party data where available.
- Pilot AI-assisted personalization using approved snippets while preserving provenance and policy guardrails; track lift vs manual baseline.
- Instrument outreach-to-pilot conversion with a simple data warehouse export to measure sequence performance by ICP and persona.
