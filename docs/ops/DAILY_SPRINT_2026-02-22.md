This could lead to sensitive data leakage in logs or API responses if these fields were present in redacted objects.\n🎯 Impact: Exposure of authentication credentials (passwords, tokens, API keys) in logs or audit trails, potentially leading to unauthorized access.\n🔧 Fix: Added a comprehensive list of sensitive field names (including `password`, `token`, `apiKey`, `secret`, `authorization`, `bearer`) to `FIELD_METADATA` with `{ sensitive: true }`.\n✅ Verification: Added a new unit test `server/src/redaction/__tests__/redact.test.ts` that explicitly checks that these fields are redacted when using the `sensitive` rule.

### Issue Scan
- Status: Deferred pending GitHub API connectivity.
- Governed Exception: `gh issue list` failed with `error connecting to api.github.com`.

## Sprint Plan (3–6 tasks)

1. **Prioritize security/GA PRs for validation**
   - Goal: Assemble evidence and next-step validation needs for PRs #18586, #18574, #18584, #18583.
   - Scope: `server/`, `.github/workflows/`, `docs/ci/`.
   - Validation: `gh pr view` evidence snapshot (completed), follow-up test runs deferred pending dependencies.

2. **Attempt issue intake for security/GA/governance labels**
   - Goal: Capture issue backlog with high-priority labels for daily sprint alignment.
   - Scope: GitHub issues.
   - Validation: `gh issue list` (deferred pending API connectivity).

3. **Refresh execution invariants**
   - Goal: Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` per execution invariant.
   - Scope: `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`.
   - Validation: Local file update (completed).

4. **Publish daily sprint log**
   - Goal: Publish evidence-first sprint log with plan, MAESTRO alignment, and blockers.
   - Scope: `docs/ops/DAILY_SPRINT_2026-02-22.md`.
   - Validation: Local file update (completed).

## MAESTRO Alignment
- **MAESTRO Layers**: Foundation, Tools, Observability, Security.
- **Threats Considered**: Credential exposure, unauthorized route access, CI gate bypass, toolchain drift.
- **Mitigations**: RBAC enforcement PRs prioritized, governance gate repair tracked, evidence-first logging, required-check policy validation.

## Execution Log
- Captured PR evidence snapshot (top 20) and detailed snapshots for #18586, #18574, #18584, #18583.
- Issue scan deferred pending GitHub API connectivity (Governed Exception).
- Updated execution invariant in `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`.
- Authored daily sprint log in `docs/ops/DAILY_SPRINT_2026-02-22.md`.
- Pushed branch `chore/daily-sprint-2026-02-22-9`; PR creation deferred pending GitHub API connectivity.

## Blockers & Governed Exceptions
- **Governed Exception**: GitHub issue scan deferred pending `api.github.com` connectivity.
- **Governed Exception**: PR creation deferred pending `api.github.com` connectivity.
- **Deferred pending dependency install**: Targeted test validation for security PRs (redaction + RBAC) pending local `pnpm install`.

## End-of-Day Report

### Planned vs Completed
- Planned: PR evidence capture, issue scan, STATUS update, daily sprint log.
- Completed: PR evidence capture, STATUS update, daily sprint log.
- Deferred: Issue scan (GitHub API connectivity), test validation (dependencies).

### PRs Touched
- None (evidence capture only); branch `chore/daily-sprint-2026-02-22-9` pushed, PR creation deferred.

### Commands Run
- `gh pr list --repo BrianCLong/summit --limit 20 --json number,title,updatedAt,author,labels,headRefName,baseRefName,state,url`
- `gh pr view 18586 --repo BrianCLong/summit --json number,title,body,labels,author,updatedAt,additions,deletions,files,reviewDecision,mergeable,state,url`

- `gh pr view 18583 --repo BrianCLong/summit --json number,title,body,labels,author,updatedAt,additions,deletions,files,reviewDecision,mergeable,state,url`
- `gh issue list --repo BrianCLong/summit --limit 50 --json number,title,updatedAt,author,labels,state,url` (deferred pending GitHub API connectivity)

### Follow-Ups
- Retry issue scan when GitHub API connectivity returns.
- Install dependencies and run focused tests for security PRs (redaction + RBAC) before merge.
