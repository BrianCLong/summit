### Issue Scan
- Governed Exception: `gh issue list` deferred pending api.github.com connectivity (`error connecting to api.github.com`).

## MAESTRO Security Alignment
- MAESTRO Layers: Foundation, Agents, Tools, Observability, Security
- Threats Considered: prompt injection via PR metadata, tool abuse via GH API failures, governance gate drift, unauthorized access to sensitive routes
- Mitigations: evidence-first logging, governed exceptions with explicit error capture, no policy bypass, PR snapshots for auditability

## Sprint Plan (3-6 Tasks)
1. **Triaged Security PRs (Sentinel RBAC)**
   - Goal: Capture evidence and define validation needs for PRs #18586 and #18574.
   - Expected Touchpoints: `server/src/app.ts`, security ledgers under `docs/`.
   - Validation: Targeted Jest security regression test (deferred pending dependencies).
2. **Governance Gate Readiness (PR #18583)**
   - Goal: Record GA governance repair evidence and identify validation gaps.
   - Expected Touchpoints: `.github/`, `scripts/ci/`, `docs/ga/`.
   - Validation: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test:unit`, `scripts/ci/verify-prompt-integrity.ts` (deferred pending dependency install).
3. **Daily Sprint Evidence + Roadmap Invariant**
   - Goal: Produce UEF evidence bundle and update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`.
   - Expected Touchpoints: `docs/ops/DAILY_SPRINT_2026-02-22.md`, `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`.
   - Validation: `git status -sb` and file diff review.

## Execution Log
- 2026-02-22T13:02:06Z: Captured open PR snapshot and PR detail evidence via `gh pr`.
- 2026-02-22T13:02:06Z: Attempted issue scan; failed with `error connecting to api.github.com` (Governed Exception).

## Blockers
- Deferred pending: GitHub Issues API connectivity (api.github.com).
- Deferred pending: Local dependency install required for Jest/CI validation (`pnpm install`).

## End-of-Day Report
- Planned: 3 tasks.
- Completed: Evidence capture and roadmap invariant update (pending commit).
- In Progress: Validation for Sentinel and governance PRs (deferred pending dependencies).
- Deferred pending: Issue scan (GH API). Dependency install for tests.
- PRs Touched: #18586, #18574, #18583 (evidence only).
- Commands Run: `gh pr list`, `gh pr view`, `gh issue list` (failed).
