Governed Exception: Deferred pending `pnpm install` (missing `cross-env`, missing `node_modules`).

## Sprint Plan (Reasoning)

Escalation: Summit Readiness Assertion referenced at `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md`.

1. Task: Validate security hardening in PR #18574 and required checks policy deltas.
Goal: Confirm protected operational endpoints and policy gates align with `docs/ci/REQUIRED_CHECKS_POLICY.yml`.
Files/Subsys: `server/src/app.ts`, `.github/workflows/*`, `docs/ci/REQUIRED_CHECKS_POLICY.yml`, `scripts/ci/governance-meta-gate.mjs`.
Validation: `node scripts/ci/governance-meta-gate.mjs` and targeted server tests when dependencies exist.

2. Task: Validate observability integration in PR #18571.
Goal: Confirm OTel service name, scrape job, alerts, and dashboard changes align with observability standards.
Files/Subsys: `docker-compose.ai.yml`, `observability/prometheus.yml`, `observability/summit-agent-alerts.yml`, `observability/grafana/dashboards/summit-dashboard.json`.
Validation: config review + governance meta-gate for required checks deltas.

3. Task: Validate storage/partitioning/backup changes in PR #18572.
Goal: Confirm Redis-backed metering, UTC partitioning, and restore logic pass unit tests.
Files/Subsys: `server/src/services/UsageMeteringService.ts`, `server/src/db/partitioning.ts`, `server/src/services/RestoreService.ts`, `server/src/services/__tests__/*`.
Validation: `pnpm --filter intelgraph-server test -- --runTestsByPath server/src/services/__tests__/UsageMeteringService.test.ts` and `server/src/services/__tests__/RestoreService.test.ts`.

4. Task: Triage GA/security issues.
Goal: Pull open issues labeled security/ga/bolt/osint/governance and map to sprint priorities.
Files/Subsys: GitHub issues index.
Validation: `gh issue list -L 50 -S "is:issue is:open (label:security OR label:ga OR label:bolt OR label:osint OR label:governance)"`.

## Execution Log

- Ran governance meta-gate on current HEAD. Result: Required Checks Policy FAIL; Determinism PASS; Branch Protection UNVERIFIABLE_ERROR. Evidence in `artifacts/governance/*`.
- Attempted targeted server unit test for `UsageMeteringService`. Governed Exception: deferred pending `pnpm install` due to missing `cross-env` and `node_modules`.
- Attempted issue scan for GA/security labels. Governed Exception: deferred pending api.github.com connectivity.
- Registered daily sprint prompt at `prompts/automation/daily-sprint@v1.md` and updated `prompts/registry.yaml` for prompt integrity compliance.
- Attempted PR creation for branch `chore/daily-sprint-2026-02-22-11`. Governed Exception: deferred pending api.github.com connectivity.

## MAESTRO Alignment

MAESTRO Layers: Foundation, Data, Observability, Security, Tools.
Threats Considered: policy drift, unauthorized endpoint access, CI gate bypass, observability blind spots, tool dependency gaps.
Mitigations: enforce `docs/ci/REQUIRED_CHECKS_POLICY.yml`, run `scripts/ci/governance-meta-gate.mjs`, require auth middleware on operational routes, keep observability alerts aligned with `observability/*`, record Governed Exceptions with evidence.

## End-of-Day Report

Completed: Governance meta-gate execution and evidence capture for required checks policy drift.
In progress: PR #18574, #18571, #18572 validations (pending dependencies), GA/security issue triage (pending GitHub API).
Blocked: `pnpm install` not run (missing `cross-env`); `gh issue list` and PR creation blocked by api.github.com connectivity.
