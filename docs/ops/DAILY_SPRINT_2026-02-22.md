## Sprint Plan (Reasoning)

### Task 1: Validate critical SQL injection fix (PR #18569)
- Goal: Confirm the SemanticSearchService fix is gated by tests and governance checks.
- Expected files/subsystems: server/, packages/, policy/gates or governance scripts.
- Validation: targeted server tests for semantic search + governance gate runner.

### Task 2: Verify operational route RBAC hardening (PR #18586 / #18574)
- Goal: Ensure sensitive operational routes are guarded by RBAC middleware and evidence is captured.
- Expected files/subsystems: server/ routes, auth middleware, security tests.
- Validation: targeted server route tests, lint, and policy/gate checks.

### Task 3: Daily sprint evidence + governance log
- Goal: Record sprint evidence bundle, plan, and blockers; update STATUS invariant.
- Expected files/subsystems: docs/ops, docs/roadmap/STATUS.json.
- Validation: none (doc-only change).

## MAESTRO Security Alignment
- MAESTRO Layers: Foundation, Data, Agents, Tools, Infra, Observability, Security.
- Threats Considered: goal manipulation, prompt injection, tool abuse, governance bypass, regression in authn/authz.
- Mitigations: evidence-first logging, governed exceptions for blocked dependencies, targeted route tests, policy gate verification.

## Execution Log
- Collected PR evidence from GitHub (top 20). Status: complete.
