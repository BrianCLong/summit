Assumed `parseInt` is sufficient for input coercion.\nDiff Budget: Small (one file modified, one test added).\nSuccess Criteria: Regression test passes, SQL injection is no longer possible.\nEvidence

Broken Access Control: The `/search/evidence` endpoint was missing role-based checks and tenant isolation, allowing any authenticated user to potentially access all evidence in the system.\n2.

**MAESTRO Alignment**
MAESTRO Layers: Foundation, Data, Agents, Tools, Observability, Security
Threats Considered: Prompt injection via PR content, governance gate bypass, evidence tampering, unauthorized access regression
Mitigations: Evidence-first capture, no policy bypass, explicit Governed Exception logging, targeted validation only

**Sprint Plan (2026-02-22)**
1. Goal: Triage PR #18569 (CRITICAL SQL injection) and attempt targeted unit validation | Touchpoints: `server/src/services/`, `server/src/services/__tests__/` | Validation: `pnpm --filter intelgraph-server test -- SemanticSearchService.test.ts`
2. Goal: Triage PR #18574 (operational routers hardening) and verify auth middleware coverage | Touchpoints: `server/src/app.ts`, security ledger docs | Validation: `pnpm --filter intelgraph-server test -- security_regression.test.js`
3. Goal: Refresh governance evidence for open PR set and log issue backlog | Touchpoints: `docs/ops/DAILY_SPRINT_2026-02-22.md` | Validation: `gh pr list`, `gh issue list`

**Execution Log**
- 2026-02-22: Captured open PR evidence and detailed PR snapshots (18569, 18574, 18322).
- 2026-02-22: Attempted issue list query; blocked by api.github.com connectivity.
- 2026-02-22: PR #18569 targeted test `pnpm --filter intelgraph-server test -- SemanticSearchService.test.ts` failed: `cross-env` missing; node_modules absent.
- 2026-02-22: PR #18574 targeted test `pnpm --filter intelgraph-server test -- security_regression.test.js` failed: `cross-env` missing; node_modules absent.

**Governed Exceptions**
- GitHub issue scan blocked by api.github.com connectivity.
- Targeted test runs blocked by missing `cross-env` due to absent `node_modules` in this worktree.

**End-of-Day Report (Current Run)**
Completed: Evidence capture and daily sprint plan.
In progress: Targeted PR triage for #18569 and #18574.
Blocked: Issue scan due to api.github.com connectivity.
Blocked: Targeted tests due to missing `cross-env` and `node_modules`.
