# Escalation Protocol

## 1. Philosophy

This protocol is designed to resolve cross-team conflicts in a deterministic, timely, and transparent manner. The primary goal is to empower teams to resolve conflicts at the lowest possible level. Escalation is a tool to be used only when teams are unable to reach an agreement on their own.

## 2. Protocol

When a conflict arises between two or more teams, the following steps must be taken:

1.  **Direct Resolution (SLA: 24 hours):**
    *   The owning teams must make a good-faith effort to resolve the conflict directly.
    *   This should be done via a synchronous meeting or a dedicated, documented thread.
    *   The outcome of this discussion must be recorded in the relevant PR or ticket.

2.  **Escalation to Release Captain (SLA: 48 hours):**
    *   If the teams are unable to reach an agreement within 24 hours, the conflict must be escalated to the **Release Captain**.
    *   The Release Captain will act as a neutral facilitator to help the teams find a mutually acceptable solution.
    *   The Release Captain's role is to mediate, not to make a unilateral decision.

3.  **Final Decision:**
    *   If the Release Captain is unable to facilitate a resolution, they will escalate the issue to the appropriate final decision-maker as defined in the team charters (e.g., VP of Engineering, CISO, Chief Architect).
    *   The final decision-maker will review the available information and make a binding decision.

## 3. Decision Log

All escalated decisions must be documented in the [Decision Log](./DECISION_LOG.md). This ensures that we have a transparent and auditable record of how and why key decisions were made. The team that "loses" the decision is responsible for documenting it.
