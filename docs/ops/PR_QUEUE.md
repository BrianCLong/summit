## Priority Legend

- **P0**: Merge train blockers / GA gates / CI / release automation / security gates
- **P1**: High value features and fixes (not gating)
- **P2**: Nice-to-have / large / risky / needs work

## Action Legend

- `merge-ready`: Checks passing, mergeable - ready for merge train
- `review`: Needs review
- `rebase-needed`: Has conflicts
- `split-needed`: Too large (>10k lines), recommend splitting
- `fix-checks`: CI checks failing
- `draft-review`: Still in draft

## P0 - Critical / GA Blockers
