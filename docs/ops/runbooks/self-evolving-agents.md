# Runbook: Self-Evolving Agents

## Feature Activation
Enable the feature via environment variable:
```bash
export SUMMIT_SELF_EVOLVE=1
```

## Monitoring Drift
Drift reports are generated by the scheduled CI job and stored in `artifacts/self-evolving-agents/drift_reports/`.

## Interpreting Drift Reports
- **Metric Regression**: If `task_success` drops by > 5% or `avg_cost` increases by > 20%.
- **Action**: Disable `SUMMIT_SELF_EVOLVE` and revert the latest policy bundle.

## Rollback Steps
1. Set `SUMMIT_SELF_EVOLVE=0`.
2. Revert the latest PR that modified `summit/self_evolve/policy.py`.
3. Flush agent caches if necessary.
