# Daily Sprint — 2026-02-11

Mode: Sensing

## Evidence Bundle

- Evidence root: `docs/ops/evidence/daily-sprint-2026-02-11`
- report.json, metrics.json, stamp.json
- Raw logs: `pr_list.txt`, `issue_list.txt`, `daily-sprint.md`

## Sprint Plan (3–6 tasks)

1. Land critical auth fix PR `#18422` (`[CRITICAL] Fix hardcoded credentials in authz-gateway`).
   - Goal: close highest-severity credential-exposure risk.
   - Scope: authz gateway + CI security verification.
   - Validation: targeted auth tests, secret scan, policy checks.
2. Land CI resilience PR `#18418` (`ci(resilience): mitigate GitHub platform disruptions`).
   - Goal: reduce flaky CI failures and mean-time-to-green.
   - Scope: workflow reliability, retry/backoff, deterministic gates.
   - Validation: workflow dry run + required check pass matrix.
3. Land golden path recovery PR `#18427` (`Golden Path Restore – Bootstrap + Up succeeds deterministically`).
   - Goal: keep `make bootstrap && make up` consistently green.
   - Scope: bootstrap path, local/dev readiness.
   - Validation: `make bootstrap`, `make up`, `make smoke`.
4. Land release-gate policy PR `#18433` (`GA Release Gate Policy and Maestro Integration`).
   - Goal: enforce merge/readiness policy with deterministic evidence.
   - Scope: gate policy, maestro integration, docs/evidence references.
   - Validation: gate checks + policy integration test pass.

## Execution Log

- Evidence generated by scripts/ops/daily-sprint-loop.sh for 2026-02-11.
- `report.json` summary shows:
  - Open PR count: `100`
  - Open issue count: `100`
  - Tool failure count: `0`
- Triage commands completed successfully (GitHub CLI available; no runtime failures).

## Blockers

- Issue stream quality is low-signal for current sprint actioning (many legacy backlog rows from 2025-10-02); prioritize PR triage first.
- High PR volume (`100` open) requires strict risk-first ordering to avoid merge-train churn.

## MAESTRO Alignment

- MAESTRO Layers: Agents, Tools, Observability, Security.
- Threats Considered: tool abuse, prompt injection, evidence tampering.
- Mitigations: deterministic hash stamp; explicit failure capture; evidence-first outputs.

## End-of-Day Report

- Completed: deterministic evidence bundle generated.
- Completed: live GitHub triage captured with zero tool failures.
- In progress: executing the four risk-prioritized PRs above.
- Blocked: none at tooling layer; execution risk is throughput/prioritization.
