# Daily Sprint — 2026-02-11

Mode: Sensing

## Evidence Bundle

- Evidence root: `docs/ops/evidence/daily-sprint-2026-02-11`
- report.json, metrics.json, stamp.json
- Raw logs: pr_list.err, issue_list.err

## Sprint Plan (3–6 tasks)

1. Restore GitHub API connectivity and re-run PR/issue triage.
   - Goal: capture top PRs and labeled issues for a current sprint plan.
   - Scope: GitHub API access (gh CLI), docs/ops evidence outputs.
   - Validation: gh pr list, gh issue list, updated evidence bundle.
2. Register daily sprint prompt in prompts/registry.yaml (governance alignment).
   - Goal: unblock prompt-integrity gate for daily sprint artifacts.
   - Scope: prompts/registry.yaml, governance checks.
   - Validation: node scripts/ci/verify-prompt-integrity.ts.
3. Once GH API is restored, select and execute 1-2 highest-risk PRs (security/GA/CI).
   - Goal: merge-ready fixes with evidence + validation.
   - Scope: determined after triage; limited to single primary zone.
   - Validation: scoped tests plus node scripts/check-boundaries.cjs when code changes.

## Execution Log

- Evidence generated by scripts/ops/daily-sprint-loop.sh for 2026-02-11.
- PR triage count is recorded in report.json.
- Issue triage count is recorded in report.json.

## Blockers

- See report.json and *.err files for current execution constraints.

## MAESTRO Alignment

- MAESTRO Layers: Agents, Tools, Observability, Security.
- Threats Considered: tool abuse, prompt injection, evidence tampering.
- Mitigations: deterministic hash stamp; explicit failure capture; evidence-first outputs.

## End-of-Day Report

- Completed: deterministic evidence bundle generated.
- In progress: triage execution pending runtime connectivity and tooling availability.
- Blocked: deferred pending explicit errors captured in evidence logs.
