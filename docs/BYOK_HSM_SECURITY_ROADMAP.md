**Version**: 1.0  
**Owner**: Security Engineering + Platform  
**Effective Date**: 2025-08-31  
**Target Delivery**: H1 2026

## Executive Summary

This roadmap defines the implementation of Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) and Hardware Security Module (HSM) capabilities for Conductor, enabling enterprise customers to maintain sovereign control over cryptographic keys while leveraging our platform's orchestration capabilities.

### Business Drivers

- **Regulatory Compliance**: SOC2, FedRAMP, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 requirements
- **Competitive Advantage**: BYOK differentiates from orchestration-only competitors
- **Revenue Impact**: Unlocks $2M+ enterprise deals blocked by key management requirements

### Success Criteria

- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified HSM integration
- Customer-managed key rotation with <5min RPO
- Zero-knowledge architecture for tenant key isolation
- 99.99% key availability SLA with <100ms crypto operations

interface KeyProvider {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly capabilities: CryptoCapability[];

  createKey(spec: KeySpec): Promise<KeyIdentifier>;
  rotateKey(keyId: KeyIdentifier, schedule: RotationSchedule): Promise<void>;

class TenantKeyManager {
  async routeKeyOperation(tenantId: string, operation: CryptoOperation): Promise<CryptoResult> {
    const keyConfig = await this.getKeyConfig(tenantId);
    const provider = this.getProvider(keyConfig.provider);

    // Apply tenant policies and audit logging
    await this.validateOperation(tenantId, operation);
    const result = await provider.execute(operation);
    await this.auditOperation(tenantId, operation, result);

    return result;
  }
}
```

### Security Controls
