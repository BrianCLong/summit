# Board-Level Positioning + Roadmap Language

## 3.1 Positioning (Board Narrative)

Summit is building the **control plane for autonomous work** in regulated and cost-sensitive environments.

* Today’s “agent tools” are mostly **demo-grade orchestration**.
* Enterprises need **operational guarantees**: predictable spend, policy enforcement, audit trails, and incident discipline.
* Summit’s differentiator is structural: we deliver an **Agent Runtime + Governance OS** that makes autonomy safe and measurable at scale.

## 3.2 Why We Win

Summit’s approach creates durable switching costs:

* Customers integrate their policies, budgets, and evidence requirements into Summit’s runtime.
* Once embedded, replacing Summit means rewriting the operational semantics of autonomy (not swapping a tool).

## 3.3 Success Metrics (Board-Trackable)

Board-level KPIs that reflect real moat creation:

* Cost per successful outcome (trend and variance)
* Human escalation rate (trend and reasons)
* Policy violations prevented (count and severity)
* Mean time to recovery for agent incidents
* Replay success rate (percent of runs reproducible)
* Audit readiness: time to produce evidence bundle for a run

## 3.4 Roadmap (Moat-Driven, Not Feature-Driven)

### Phase 1: Runtime Foundations

* Agent lifecycle control (spawn/suspend/resume/kill)
* Unified budgets (token/time/tool/$)
* Tool policy enforcement pre-execution
* Immutable execution logs + run manifests

Board language: “We converted autonomy from an experiment into an operated system.”

### Phase 2: Predictable Autonomy

* Cost-aware planner and dynamic model routing
* Graceful degradation under budget limits
* Confidence-weighted escalation and operator controls

Board language: “We made autonomous execution predictable and financeable.”

### Phase 3: Reliability and Trust

* System-level evaluation harness and stability metrics
* Replay mode and incident review workflow (AIR)
* Regression gates on trajectory-level outcomes

Board language: “We achieved SRE-grade reliability for agent systems.”

### Phase 4: Compliance and Provenance at Scale

* Evidence bundle automation (provenance, attestations)
* Policy packs aligned to SOC2/ISO/SLSA controls
* Enterprise-grade audit workflows

Board language: “We operationalized compliance as code within the runtime.”

## 3.5 Strategic Risks and Mitigations

* Risk: competitors copy surface features
  Mitigation: emphasize semantics (runtime control, enforcement, replay) and system-level metrics.

* Risk: “agent” hype cools
  Mitigation: position Summit as control plane for automation under constraints, not novelty.

* Risk: model provider lock-in attempts
  Mitigation: maintain model-agnostic routing and consistent governance layer.
