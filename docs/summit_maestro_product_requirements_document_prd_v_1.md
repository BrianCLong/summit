# Summit Maestro — Product Requirements Document (PRD) v1.0

**Owner:** Platform PM • **Authors:** Product + Eng + SRE • **Date:** 2025‑08‑31 • **Status:** Draft for Review

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Summit Maestro (SM)** is a reusable orchestration and workflow runtime that **builds, operates, and automates** Summit IntelGraph (SIG) and other products. It provides policy‑aware pipelines, runbooks, agent execution, and an operator console while remaining **independent** of any single product’s data model. Maestro embeds cleanly into our PMI (repos, CI/CD, IaC, observability) and exposes stable APIs/events for integration.

**Why now:** Reduce time‑to‑value and operational toil for SIG, enable faster onboarding of new data sources, deterministic environments, and repeatable operations. Also create a cross‑product automation asset.

**Success (headline):** 80% of SIG build/ops via cataloged Maestro runbooks; pipeline MTTR < 15m; one non‑SIG project live on Maestro by end of Q4 2025.

---

## 2. Goals & Non‑Goals

### Goals

1. **Reusable Orchestration Fabric:** Provide a DAG/workflow engine, agent runtime, and policy hooks usable across products.
2. **Build & Operate SIG:** Cover CI/CD, backfills, seeded demos, ingest/ETL, chaos & recovery drills, disclosure packaging.
3. **Governed Execution:** Enforce policy at execution with provenance receipts and auditable trails.
4. **Developer Velocity:** Golden paths for local dev → staging → prod with environment promotion and guardrails.
5. **Observability & FinOps:** First‑class metrics, traces, logs, budgets/quotas per namespace/tenant.

### Non‑Goals

- Replace SIG as the user‑facing intelligence platform or system of record.
- Embed IntelGraph ontology into Maestro core (mappings only).
- Build a general purpose BI/visualization layer (basic operator console only).

---

## 3. Target Users & Personas

- **Platform/Data Engineers (Primary):** Author pipelines/runbooks, manage connectors, operate environments.
- **SRE/Operations (Primary):** Run backfills, triage failures, rollbacks, chaos drills; govern quotas and budgets.
- **Product Engineers (Secondary):** Trigger build/test/deploy flows; integrate SDK to call workflows.
- **Power Users/Admins (Guard‑railed, Optional):** Trigger allow‑listed runbooks from SIG.

Key needs: reliability, policy compliance, fast feedback, reproducibility, low cognitive load, clear logs/errors.

---

## 4. Problem Statement & Opportunities

Building and operating SIG demands many bespoke scripts and ad‑hoc jobs. This causes drift, security risk, and slow incident recovery. A unified, policy‑aware conductor reduces toil, increases repeatability, and enables reuse for new products.

Opportunities: standardize connectors, shorten onboarding, unify provenance across execution paths, and establish a marketplace of reusable tasks/runbooks.

---

## 5. Scope

### In Scope (MVP → v1)

- Workflow/DAG engine with retries, backoff, task caching, artifacts.
- Agent runtime (container/K8s jobs/serverless/local runner).
- Runbook catalog (versioned, signed manifests) + Operator Console.
- Secrets & identity (workload identity, sealed secrets, rotation hooks).
- Policy enforcement (OPA/ABAC) at execution time with purpose & authority context.
- Provenance receipts and signed manifests handed to target systems.
- Connectors SDK (TS/Python; Java post‑v1) + plugin ABI for tasks & notifiers.
- CI/CD blueprints: build/test/deploy promotions for SIG services.
- Data/ETL blueprints: ingest → validate → enrich → hand‑off to SIG.
- Observability: metrics/traces/logs with correlation IDs; budgets/quotas.

### Out of Scope (v1)

- Full analyst UI; complex ad‑hoc graph query UX.
- Acting as system of record for operational data beyond required metadata.
- GPU scheduling optimizations (tracked for v1.x).

---

## 6. Success Metrics & KPIs

- **Coverage:** ≥80% of common SIG ops via cataloged runbooks by Q4 2025.
- **Reliability:** Pipeline MTTR < 15 min; task success rate ≥ 98% (rolling 30‑day).
- **Velocity:** New connector time‑to‑first‑run ≤ 3 days; env bootstrap ≤ 30 minutes.
- **Compliance:** 100% runs carry policy evaluation + provenance receipts.
- **Adoption:** 1 external project live; N‑2 version compatibility maintained.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Workflows & DAGs

- Define pipelines as declarative manifests (YAML/JSON) referencing versioned tasks.
- Support dependencies, fan‑out/fan‑in, conditional branches, retries, and timeouts.
- Provide task caching and deterministic replays with pinned versions & inputs.

### 7.2 Runbooks & Catalog

- Runbook types: **Ops**, **Data/ETL**, **CI/CD**, **Chaos/Recovery**, **Demo/Seed**.
- Versioned, signed, and allow‑listed. RBAC/ABAC defines who can trigger what, with purpose binding.
- Input schema validation and typed parameters; preview & dry‑run.

### 7.3 Execution Runners

- **Kubernetes Jobs**, **Container Runner**, **Serverless Adapter**, **Local Dev Runner**.
- Resource classes with quotas and budgets; per‑namespace isolation.

### 7.4 Connectors & Tasks SDK

- SDKs for TypeScript and Python (v1); Java (v1.x).
- Standard task interface: `init(ctx)`, `validate(input)`, `execute()`, `emit(events)`.
- Built‑in tasks: HTTP, gRPC, Kafka/NATS, S3/Blob, DB read/write, transform, schema‑validate, notify, wait/sleep, approval gate.

### 7.5 Policy & Security

- Mandatory call to **PDP** with `purpose`, `authority`, `license` before sensitive actions.
- Workload identity; no long‑lived static tokens.
- Per‑task secrets mount; audit of access.

### 7.6 Provenance & Audit

- Produce a **provenance receipt** per run: inputs, code/task versions, hashes, outputs, signatures.
- Export receipts to SIG or external target; disclosure packages are reproducible.

### 7.7 Observability

- Metrics (runs, latency, success rate), traces with span links to SIG operations, structured logs.
- Operator Console shows runs, DAG graph, logs, artifacts; supports cancel/retry/backfill.

### 7.8 Interfaces to IntelGraph

- Write via **Graph Ingest API** (batch/stream) and **Claim/Provenance API**.
- Optional: SIG triggers allow‑listed runbooks via **Runbooks API**.

---

## 8. Non‑Functional Requirements

- **Availability:** 99.9% for control plane; 99.5% for runners (SLOs per class).
- **Performance:** Control plane p95 API < 200ms; task scheduler decision p95 < 500ms.
- **Scalability:** 10k concurrent tasks; 100 RPS control‑plane sustained.
- **Security:** CIS‑hardening; signed artifacts; SBOM for release images; supply‑chain attestations.
- **Compliance:** Audit trails immutable (WORM storage); time‑synced via trusted NTP; PII handling per policy.
- **Portability:** K8s‑first; local dev runner; cloud agnostic.

## 10. Key Interfaces (Initial)

### Maestro → IntelGraph

- `POST /ingest/batch` → `{ jobId, receipts[] }`
- Streaming topics: `ingest.*`, `er.*`, `risk.*`, `ops.*` (signed, idempotent, schema‑versioned)
- `POST /claims/register`
- `POST /exports/request`
- `POST /policy/evaluate`

### IntelGraph → Maestro (optional)

- `POST /runbooks/trigger` (allow‑listed only)
- `GET /runs/{id}` status/logs/artifacts

### Maestro Internal

- `POST /workflows` (create/update), `POST /runs` (start), `PATCH /runs/{id}` (cancel), `GET /runs` (list)

---

## 11. Data Model (High‑Level)

- **Run:** id, workflowRef, version, initiator, inputs hash, start/stop, status, metrics
- **TaskExec:** runId, taskId, codeRef (digest), inputs/outputs hashes, logsRef, policyDecision
- **ProvenanceReceipt:** runId, artifacts[], signatures[], parent/child links
- **CatalogItem (Runbook/Task/Connector):** name, semver, manifest, signature, scopes, allow‑list

No IntelGraph ontology in core; use mapping layers/adapters.

---

## 12. Telemetry & Analytics

- Emit metrics to Prometheus/OpenTelemetry; traces to OTLP endpoint.
- Default dashboards: Run success rate, MTTR, backlog depth, budget/quota usage, policy denials.
- Audit export to WORM store with retention policy.

---

## 13. Security, Privacy, Compliance

- Workload identity (OIDC); least‑privilege service accounts.
- Secrets from sealed store (e.g., KMS‑backed); rotation hooks.
- PDP decision logs immutable; reason‑for‑access captured.
- Supply‑chain: signed images (Sigstore), SBOM, provenance for releases.
- Data handling per policy; no ungoverned PII persistence in Maestro core.

---

## 14. Dependencies & Integrations

- Kubernetes or equivalent; container registry; artifact store (blobs); message bus (Kafka/NATS).
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) or compatible PDP.
- Observability stack (OTel collector, logs index, metrics DB).
- IntelGraph APIs for ingest/claims/exports.

---

## 15. Assumptions & Constraints

- Teams will adopt declarative manifests and contract tests.
- Network egress to targets governed by policy.
- Budget/quotas enforced at namespace level.

---

## 16. Risks & Mitigations

- **Coupling creep** → Contract‑only interfaces; ADR review for any new endpoint.
- **Schema drift** → Versioned schemas; contract tests in CI.
- **Policy bypass** → Deny by default; workload identity; signed requests.
- **Ops sprawl** → Single Console; golden paths; linting for manifests.
- **Perf regressions** → Performance CI; SLO alerts; capacity planning runbooks.

---

## 17. Release Plan & Milestones (Q3–Q4 2025)

### MVP (by Oct 15, 2025)

- Control plane (workflows API, scheduler, metadata store)
