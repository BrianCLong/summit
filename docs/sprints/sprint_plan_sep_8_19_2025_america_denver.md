# Sprint Plan — Sep 8–19, 2025 (America/Denver)

> **Context:** Security & intelligence engineering + threat research team. Two-week timebox. This plan is turnkey—drop into Jira/Linear and go.

---

## 1) Sprint Goal (SMART)
Deliver **v2 alert triage and response** improvements that cut mean time to triage (MTTT) by **30%**, expand coverage for **new TTPs** mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK**, and enable **one-click containment** for top three playbooks—**by Sep 19, 2025**.

**Key outcomes**
- Reduce MTTT by 30% compared to previous 4-week baseline.
- +15 detections/analytics mapped to ATT&CK (new or tuned), with tests.
- Integrate SOAR connector v1 for auto-ticket + containment on 3 playbooks.
- Ship user-facing “Analyst Assist” panel (beta) behind a feature flag.

---

## 2) Success Metrics & Verification
- **MTTT:** \<= 15 minutes median across P1/P2 alerts (from baseline 22 min).  
  *Verify:* Analyst dashboard + data export.
- **Detection Quality:** \>= 0.85 precision / \>= 0.70 recall in staging canary.  
  *Verify:* Offline eval set + shadow prod.
- **Playbook Automation:** \>= 80% success rate end-to-end for 3 playbooks.  
  *Verify:* SOAR run logs; incident post-run check.
- **Coverage:** \>= 15 ATT&CK techniques (create/tune) with unit + integration tests.  
  *Verify:* Detection registry and test matrix.

---

## 3) Scope
**Must-have (commit):**
- Alert Triage v2 backlog (ranking model scoring/policy, UX quick actions, evidence snippets).
- SOAR connector v1 (ServiceNow/Jira + EDR containment for Host Quarantine, Account Disable, Block Hash).
- Detection content pack v5 (TTPs: credential access, lateral movement, persistence).  
- Analyst dashboard: MTTT & false-positive rate widget.
- Runbook updates: 3 playbooks and 1 emergency change window policy.

**Stretch (best-effort):**
- Threat intel ingestion: 2 new feeds + de-dup.
- Multi-tenant data isolation guardrail tests.
- Red team tabletop (2 hrs) focused on business email compromise (BEC).

**Out-of-scope:**
- Mobile app changes; full RBAC overhaul; cross-cloud asset inventory.

---

## 4) Team & Capacity (example; adjust to your roster)
- **Team:** 4 Eng, 1 Data Scientist, 1 Threat Researcher, 1 QA, 1 PM.  
- **Timebox:** 10 working days; focus factor **0.8** (meetings, interrupts).  
- **Nominal capacity:**  
  - Eng: 4 × 8 pts = 32 pts  
  - DS: 6 pts  
  - TR: 6 pts  
  - QA: 6 pts  
  - **Subtotal:** 50 pts × 0.8 = **40 pts** usable.

> Replace with your actual team/pointing before committing the sprint.

## 6) Dependencies & Assumptions
- SOAR vendor API keys active in staging + scoped prod.
- EDR supports quarantine via API; rate limits understood.
- Data labeling set for triage model training; sample size \>= 5k alerts.
- Legal sign-off for automated account disable in prod (approval gate enabled).

---

## 7) Timeline & Ceremonies (MT)

- Code merged, tests passing (unit/integration), dashboards updated.
- Security review complete; secrets managed; logging & audit added.
- Playbooks/docs updated; enablement note posted to #analyst-ops.
- Feature flag strategy decided (on for beta/off in prod) and rollback plan.

---

## 10) QA & Validation Plan
- Unit test min coverage: 80% on changed code.
- Integration tests for 3 playbooks, including failure paths.
- Shadow-prod for scoring service; parity vs baseline.
- Performance SLOs tracked: scoring P95 \<= 200ms; UI TTI \<= 3s.

## 11) Risk Register (RAID)
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Owner | Mitigation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Vendor API throttling | Medium | High | B2 Eng | Backoff + queue; cache; sandbox tests |
| False positives spike after tuning | Medium | Medium | TR | Canary + revert script; FP guardrails |
| Legal blocks automated disable | Low | High | PM/Legal | Approval gate; manual fallback |
| Model drift post-deploy | Medium | Medium | DS | Weekly eval; drift alerts; feature store freeze |
| Data privacy issues with snippets | Low | High | Sec/PM | PII redaction; audit; feature flag |

---

## 12) Communications & Status
- **Channels:** #sprint-room (daily), #analyst-ops (enablement), Email to execs (Fri weekly).
- **Reports:** Burnup chart, velocity, blocked tickets, MTTT trend.
- **Escalation:** PM → Eng Lead → Director.

---

## 13) Compliance/Security Guardrails
- Least privilege for all new integrations; secrets in vault.
- Data handling: redact PII in model inputs/outputs; retention policy respected.
- Audit logging for all automated actions; tamper-evident.

---

## 14) Release Plan & Rollback
- **Staged rollout:** 10% beta cohort → 50% → 100% (with health checks).
