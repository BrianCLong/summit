# IntelGraph v1.1 Scale-Out, Black-Cell & Ecosystem SDK Roadmap

**Goal:** Advance IntelGraph from v1.0 GA → v1.1 focused on scale‑out (10 → 100 tenants), Black‑Cell air‑gapped mode with cryptographic resync, and a first‑class Ecosystem SDK.

**Timeline:** Immediate Start (Parallel Tracks)

## Epic 1: Black-Cell (Air-Gapped) Mode & Resync
**Goal:** Enable fully offline operation for secure environments with deterministic resync to the global ledger.
- **Story 1.1: Packager (ig-pack):** Build a tool to bundle services, policy, and data into a signed artifact for offline transfer.
- **Story 1.2: Resync Protocol:** Implement export manifest generation (content-hash trees + signature chain) and server-side verify/merge logic.
- **Story 1.3: Ledger Continuity:** Ensure immutable provenance ledger continuity post-resync (merging local chain into global).
- **Story 1.4: File-Drop Ingest:** Create a watched folder mechanism for ingesting data in air-gapped mode.

## Epic 2: Partner Ecosystem SDK & App Contracts
**Goal:** Empower partners to build secure, compliant apps on IntelGraph using standard SDKs.
- **Story 2.1: TypeScript SDK:** Core client for auth, persisted queries, and typed graph access.
- **Story 2.2: Python SDK:** Data science focus (ingest mappers, provenance attach).
- **Story 2.3: App Manifest:** Define YAML schema for app scopes, purposes, and retention tiers.
- **Story 2.4: Plugin API:** Stable interfaces for connector adapters and policy evaluators.

## Epic 3: Scale-Out Performance & Cost
**Goal:** Support 100 tenants with strict SLOs and sustainable unit economics.
- **Story 3.1: Query Acceleration:** Implement read-through cache and materialized edge projections for hot paths.
- **Story 3.2: Ingest Fairness:** Adaptive backpressure and quota management per tenant.
- **Story 3.3: Cost Observability:** Dashboard for unit economics per tenant/event.
- **Story 3.4: Autoscaling:** Policies based on SLO burn rates and cost targets.

## Epic 4: Evidence-Aware AI (RAG)
**Goal:** AI responses must be grounded, cited, and redaction-aware.
- **Story 4.1: Provenance Retriever:** RAG retrieval that respects purpose tags and returns signed citations.
- **Story 4.2: Redaction-Aware Generator:** LLM prompt engineering and filtering to enforce ABAC on generated text.
- **Story 4.3: Evaluation Harness:** Automated testing for groundedness (target ≥ 0.9) and PII leakage.

## Epic 5: Data Product Exchange
**Goal:** Secure sharing of graph datasets with enforceable contracts.
- **Story 5.1: Product Catalog:** Service to list available datasets with metadata (TOS, License).
- **Story 5.2: Contract Registry:** Store and validate usage contracts.
- **Story 5.3: Signed Export/Import:** Cryptographic verification of data products during exchange.
- **Story 5.4: Privacy Budget:** Differential privacy controls for aggregate sharing.

## Constraints & Gates
- **Performance:** API p95 ≤ 350ms, Graph 1-hop ≤ 300ms.
- **Security:** Zero Trust (OIDC, mTLS, OPA), Immutable Provenance.
- **Quality:** 100% CI pass, SLO compliance, AI Eval pass.
