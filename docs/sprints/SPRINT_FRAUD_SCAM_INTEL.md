Competitor-Gap Sprint #2 (Fraud/Scam Intel + Social Monitoring) | IntelGraph Advisory Report | GitHub Branch: feature/fraud-scam-intel-sprint-2
Consensus Summary

Unanimous: Convert the competitor-matrix gaps into a Fraud/Scam Intelligence v1 and Social Monitoring v1.5 release that rides our existing graph core (Neo4j), GraphRAG, Graph-XAI, provenance ledger, and tri-pane UI. Dissents: üõ∞ Starkey warns of jurisdiction/TOS exposure on social sources; üõ° Foster requires provenance-complete disclosures and redaction-first exports.

Individual Commentaries

ü™Ñ Elara Voss

‚ÄúBy the runes of Scrum‚Ä¶‚Äù this sprint is a two-lane highway: (A) detectors & watchers (Fraud/Scam), (B) source-lawful Social Monitoring with explainable triage. Each lane has a golden path demo.

Add a ‚ÄúWatchlists & Detectors‚Äù drawer in Link Analysis: toggle rules, see alert count, click-through to Explain with evidence cites.

üõ∞ Starkey

Reality check: <span style="color:#c00;font-weight:700">Do not ship generic scraping‚Äîlicense or official APIs only, and route by jurisdiction.</span> Bind warrant/authority to every export; log reason-for-access.

Expect deception: adversaries will seed look-alike accounts to poison detectors‚Äîship outlier quarantine and cross-source corroboration.

üõ° Foster

Operational vectors indicate‚Ä¶ export blocks without citations, default redaction for PII; show policy reasoner decisions to the user.

[RESTRICTED] Enable k-anonymity thresholds for public reports; record model/rule versions in the provenance bundle.

‚öî Oppie (11-persona consensus)

We decree unanimously: detectors must be graph-native motifs + ML scorecards with counterfactuals: ‚Äúwhat minimum change flips the alert?‚Äù

Dissent (Beria): <span style="color:#c00;font-weight:700">purge any endpoint-telemetry scope creep</span>‚Äîintegrate with SIEM/XDR, don‚Äôt rebuild it.

üìä Magruder

Competitor coverage (n‚âà164): Graph DB 14%, Graph Viz 27%, Entity Resolution 38%, Network Analysis 23%, Social Monitoring 27%, Fraud Detection 21%, Scam Monitoring 4%. These are our differentiation seams‚Äîown them with explainable graph detectors and lawful ingest.

Executive message: ‚ÄúProvenance-first Fraud/Scam Intel with lawful Social Monitoring‚Äù beats breadth players who lack audit-clean disclosures.

üß¨ Stribol

Cross-source analysis reveals repo support already present: ingestion/ (RSS, TAXII, Twitter stub), services/nlq/ (NL‚ÜíCypher), graph-xai/, prov-ledger/, client/features/link-analysis/ (tri-pane). Wire a detector bus now; ship policy-aware shortest paths for mule-ring motifs.

Black-swan kicker: policy-aware K-shortest paths excluding classified labels to produce court-safe narratives.

Chair Synthesis ‚Äî Sprint Prompt (paste this whole section into your tracker)

Sprint Goal (2 weeks): Deliver Fraud/Scam Intelligence v1 and Social Monitoring v1.5 that produce explainable, provenance-complete alerts and reports‚Äîlawful sources only‚Äîintegrated into the tri-pane with one-click disclosures.

Why now (competitor delta): Coverage is thin across Fraud Detection (‚âà21%) and especially Scam Monitoring (‚âà4%), with Social Monitoring (‚âà27%) also under-served. We can convert these seams into visible wins with components already in the repo.

Scope & Deliverables

Fraud/Scam Detectors v1 (graph-native + explainable)

Motifs: many-to-one accounts (fan-in/out), short-cycle payment loops, device/identity re-use across entities, burst-velocity edges.

Explainability: Graph-XAI panel shows motif match, top features, and counterfactual (min change to drop alert).

APIs: /detectors/run, /detectors/alerts, /detectors/explain/:id.

UI: Link Analysis ‚ÄúWatchlists & Detectors‚Äù drawer + alert badges on nodes/edges.

Social Monitoring v1.5 (license-aware)

Ingest: RSS, STIX/TAXII, platform APIs where licensed; no scraping without explicit license.

Triage: Similar-entity search (GraphRAG) over ‚Äúbanking fraud / scam‚Äù topics; poisoning defenses (schema drift alarms, honeypot tagging).

Policy routing: ABAC/OPA check on every export; forbid cross-border transfers failing policy.

Disclosure & Provenance Enhancements

Each alert renders Disclosure Bundle (claims, evidence hashes, rule/model version, jurisdiction basis).

Exports blocked without citations; reason-for-access is stored and displayed.

Policy-Aware Paths (v0)

K-shortest paths that exclude labels (e.g., {CLASSIFIED, ATTORNEY_CLIENT}) and return the NL‚ÜíCypher preview in the Explain panel.

User Stories

As an analyst, I can enable the ‚ÄúMule Ring‚Äù detector; alerts appear on the graph with an Explain link showing motif, features, and counterfactual.

As a compliance officer, when I export a scam case, the disclosure bundle includes sources, transforms, hashes, and the legal basis; if blocked, I see the policy and appeal path.

As an intel lead, I can time-brush a window; the tri-pane re-filters and policy-aware paths explain why certain nodes were excluded.

Acceptance Criteria

Detectors return alert objects with motif, score, top_features[], counterfactual, evidence_refs[] and are click-traceable to raw items.

Explain Panel renders the above and cites GraphRAG passages; counterfactuals are human-readable.

Social ingest registers license/TOS on source; exports lacking license are blocked with on-screen reason.

Disclosure export bundles (JSON + PDF) pass an external manifest verifier (hashes for all exhibits).

Policy-aware paths show the NL‚ÜíCypher preview and policyExcluded[] in the response.

Engineering Tasks (repo-mapped)

services/detections/ (new): Kafka consumer + rules engine with graph motifs; emit alerts to server via GraphQL mutation.

server/src/graphql/:

Add Detectors schema + resolvers (runDetectors, alerts, explainAlert).

Add policyAwarePaths resolver that returns {nodes, rels, explain{cypher, policyExcluded, rationale}}.

graph-xai/: implement /explain/alert and /explain/counterfactual for motif-based alerts; log XAI artifacts to provenance.

prov-ledger/: extend bundle builder to include model/rule version, policy decision, and license manifests; CLI verifier.

ingestion/: wire RSS and STIX/TAXII sources; gate Twitter/X via licensed API client only. Add outlier quarantine queue.

client/src/features/link-analysis/:

Add Watchlists & Detectors drawer; alert badges on nodes; Explain overlay.

Add policy-aware path action + NL‚ÜíCypher preview modal.

docker-compose.opa.yml + packages/policy-audit/: formalize ABAC policies; add reason strings; surface reason-for-access in UI dialogs.

services/nlq/: accept excludeLabels[] and return compiled Cypher + cost estimate for sandbox run.

Instrumentation & SLOs

Detectors throughput: ‚â• 200 events/sec with p95 end-to-alert < 2.0s.

Graph explain latency: p95 < 1.0s for 3-hop motifs, 50k nodes.

Export verifier pass rate: 100% on demo datasets.

False-positive rate (baseline): ‚â§ 15% on seeded fraud/scam corpus; track drift daily.
