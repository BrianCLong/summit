Analyst Copilot (NLQ + GraphRAG) + Decision Workflows + Observability | IntelGraph Advisory Report | GitHub Branch: feature/copilot-nlq-otel-sprint-3
Consensus Summary

Unanimous View: Convert the lowest-coverage seams in the competitor matrix into visible differentiation: NL‚ÜíCypher + GraphRAG Copilot, Decision Workflows (human-in-the-loop), and OpenTelemetry-powered Observability. Competitor coverage (n=164) indicates severe under-supply: RAG 0.61%, Cypher 0.61%, Index-Free Adjacency 0.61%, Data Federation 1.22%, OpenTelemetry 1.22%, Full-Stack Observability 1.22%, NLP 3.05%, Explainable AI 3.66%, Decision Workflows 3.66%.
Dissents: üõ∞ Starkey warns of prompt/data exfiltration & geo-jurisdiction risk in NLQ; üõ° Foster requires explainability, redaction, and provenance-complete exports.

Individual Commentaries
ü™Ñ Elara Voss

‚ÄúBy the runes of Scrum‚Ä¶‚Äù This sprint is a three-lane highway: Copilot, Workflows, Observability‚Äîeach with a golden-path demo (query ‚Üí explain ‚Üí export).

Ship a Copilot console docked to the tri-pane; results show query, compiled Cypher, rationale, cost and a one-click ‚ÄúExplain this‚Äù overlay.

üõ∞ Starkey

Reality check: <span style="color:#c00;font-weight:700">Bold red dissent: NLQ without guardrails = prompt injection + cross-border data leakage.</span> Route Copilot calls via OPA/ABAC; block jurisdictions at compile time; never send raw exhibits to LLMs.

Add ‚Äúred team‚Äù prompts for deception; log all prompts/compiles for audit.

üõ° Foster

Operational vectors indicate‚Ä¶ Copilot outputs must include explanation + provenance or be blocked. Default PII redaction in previews; no biometric inference.

[RESTRICTED] Store model+policy versions in disclosure bundles; expose denial reasons (GDPR Art. 15/22 alignment).

‚öî Oppie (11-persona consensus)

We decree unanimously: GraphRAG must cite passages + graph paths; show counterfactual edits that would change an answer.

Dissent (Beria): <span style="color:#c00;font-weight:700">purge any endpoint-telemetry ambitions</span>‚Äîintegrate with SIEM/XDR; don‚Äôt build EDR.

üìä Magruder

For executive traction: competitors crowd ‚Äúviz,‚Äù but barely touch RAG (0.61%), Observability (1.22%), Decision Workflows (3.66%). Plant our flag here with court-safe explainability + audit-clean telemetry.

üß¨ Stribol

Cross-source analysis reveals repo primitives ready to wire: GraphQL, Graph-XAI, Prov-ledger, NLQ, tri-pane. Add a cost-guarded NL‚ÜíCypher compiler and OTEL traces for each graph op.

Black-swan: policy-aware K-shortest paths with NL explanation‚Äîexclude labels {CLASSIFIED, PRIVILEGED}.

Chair Synthesis ‚Äî Sprint Prompt (paste this section into your tracker as the full brief)
Sprint Goal (2 weeks)

Deliver Analyst Copilot v1 (NL‚ÜíCypher + GraphRAG), Decision Workflows v1 (human-in-the-loop triage), and Observability v1 (OpenTelemetry traces/metrics) with provenance-complete explanations and policy enforcement.

Why Now (competitor-matrix deltas)

RAG 0.61%, Cypher 0.61%, Index-Free Adjacency 0.61%, Data Federation 1.22%, OpenTelemetry 1.22%, Full-Stack Observability 1.22%, NLP 3.05%, Explainable AI 3.66%, Decision Workflows 3.66%. These seams create immediate differentiation when tied to our graph core and provenance.

Scope & Deliverables

Analyst Copilot v1 (NL‚ÜíCypher + GraphRAG)

NL query ‚Üí compiled Cypher preview with cost estimate, policy verdict, and explanation (why this pattern, which indices, what‚Äôs excluded).

GraphRAG answers: cite passages + graph paths; include counterfactual (‚Äúminimum change to flip the answer‚Äù).

Guardrails: prompt sanitization, source & jurisdiction filters, no raw exhibit leakage.

Decision Workflows v1 (human-in-the-loop)

Workflow types: Alert triage, ER adjudication, Report approval.

Each step logs assignee, decision, rationale, evidence refs; denial shows policy reason and appeal path.

Observability v1 (OTEL + performance)

OpenTelemetry traces for GraphQL resolvers, Neo4j queries, RAG calls; metrics: p50/p95 latency, node/edge counts, compile cost.

Query cost budgeter: deny or warn on expensive plans; surface cost in UI.

Data Federation v0 (read-only)

Register external sources (licensed APIs) and surface them in NLQ as named contexts (e.g., context:fincrime_rss).

Single-pane results with per-source provenance.

Disclosure & Provenance Enhancements

Every Copilot answer and workflow export emits a Disclosure Bundle (model/policy versions, prompts, compiled Cypher, evidence hashes).

Out of Scope

Endpoint telemetry/EDR; generic web scraping without explicit license; biometric identification; cross-border data transfer outside policy.

User Stories

As an analyst, I type ‚Äúwho brokers between acct A and B in Q2, excluding classified edges?‚Äù and see compiled Cypher, policy-aware exclusions, and an explain panel; I run it and get a graph + narrative with citations.

As a lead, I push an ER merge into a Decision Workflow where a reviewer approves/rejects with rationale; the case log becomes part of the disclosure export.

As a platform owner, I open the Observability dashboard and see traces for the last 50 queries, with p95 latency and top slow Cypher plans.

Acceptance Criteria

NL‚ÜíCypher: API returns {cypher, costEstimate, policyVerdict{allow,reason,excludedLabels[]}, explanation}; UI shows preview + warnings; blocked queries include appeal path.

GraphRAG: responses contain citations[] (doc spans + path ids) and counterfactual field; clicking a citation highlights nodes/edges.

Decision Workflows: persisted state machine with audit trail; all denials show human-readable reason; exports include workflow history.

Observability: OTEL traces for ‚â•90% of GraphQL resolvers; metrics dashboard (p50/p95, error rate, top N slow ops); query cost limiter active.

Data Federation v0: queries limited to licensed/registered sources; provenance includes source name + license id.
