# Sprint 01 (Jan 5–16, 2026): “Legitimacy as Leverage”

**Sprint objective:** Reduce enterprise exposure while increasing operational freedom—by hardening governance, accelerating revenue contracts, and pre-positioning policy + crisis assets.

**Sprint success signals (measurable):**

* Cycle time on priority deals down (target: **≤5 business days** from redline to executable on top 10 deals)
* **Zero** “unknown owner” compliance obligations across key regimes (privacy/security/sector regs)
* Board/exec decisions documented within **48 hours** of meeting
* Crisis package ready: **1-page**, **Q&A**, **holding statements**, and escalation tree shipped

---

## Workstream A — Governance & Control (Shield + Authority)

**Goal:** Lock decision rights, reduce ambiguity, and create audit-ready legitimacy.

**Planned deliverables**

* Updated **Delegation of Authority** + signature matrix (legal/finance/procurement/security)
* Board/committee cadence + **minute template** that captures defensibility (who knew what, when)
* “Material Risk Register” v1 with owners + mitigation dates

**Definition of Done**

* Signed DoA published; board templates adopted; risk register reviewed with CEO/CFO

---

## Workstream B — Commercial Contracting (Revenue Velocity)

**Goal:** Standardize positions to close faster without conceding hidden liabilities.

**Planned deliverables**

* “Fast lane” **playbook**: fallback clauses for indemnity, limitation of liability, SLA, DPAs
* Updated **MSA/SOW** set + click-through order form (where applicable)
* Deal desk triage rubric (Green/Yellow/Red) with approval routing

**Definition of Done**

* Playbook used on at least **3 live negotiations**; templates in shared system; triage live

---

## Workstream C — Regulatory & Compliance Architecture (Zero-Gap Framework)

**Goal:** Convert compliance into a modular system (not ad hoc heroics).

**Planned deliverables**

* Compliance obligations map (top regimes relevant to your business) + owner assignments
* “Minimum Viable Compliance” controls list (what must exist vs. what’s aspirational)
* Audit packet skeleton: policies, evidence checklist, and control narratives

**Definition of Done**

* Obligations map signed by functional owners; evidence checklist ready for audit request

---

## Workstream D — Privacy & Security (Breach-Proof the Narrative)

**Goal:** Pre-position legal + operational readiness for incidents and customer scrutiny.

**Planned deliverables**

* Incident response **legal annex**: privilege protocol, notification decision tree, templates
* Data inventory + retention principles (what we collect, why, where, how long)
* DPA addendum refresh + subprocessors language + cross-border transfer posture (as needed)

**Definition of Done**

* Tabletop scheduled; annex approved by Security; DPA language deployed in templates

---

## Workstream E — Government Relations & Policy (Access + Influence)

**Goal:** Build channels and a defensible public posture without overcommitting.

**Planned deliverables**

* Stakeholder map (agencies/legislators/trade groups) + outreach plan
* 2-page policy narrative: “what we do, why it matters, what we need”
* Hearing / inquiry readiness kit (talking points + document preservation protocol)

**Definition of Done**

* Outreach targets prioritized; narrative approved; readiness kit stored + versioned

---

## Workstream F — Disputes, IP, and Lawfare Readiness (Sword in the Scabbard)

**Goal:** Ensure we can strike or defend quickly with minimal discovery pain.

**Planned deliverables**

* Litigation hold & document retention workflow (practical + enforceable)
* IP posture check: invention capture process + top assets list + filing decisions queue
* Pre-drafted cease & desist / response templates for common threats

**Definition of Done**

* Hold workflow tested; IP intake form live; templates approved and stored

---

## Workstream G — Crisis Comms & Narrative Control (Public Legitimacy)

**Goal:** Control the first 60 minutes and the first 60 days.

**Planned deliverables**

* Crisis comms “go-bag”: holding statements (incident, outage, allegation, regulatory inquiry)
* Media Q&A + internal FAQ + employee guidance
* Escalation tree + war-room operating rhythm (who decides, who speaks, who documents)

**Definition of Done**

* Go-bag complete; exec on-call roster confirmed; single source of truth folder established

---

# Sprint Operating Rhythm (non-negotiable)

* **Mon Jan 5:** Sprint kickoff + intake freeze for non-urgent items
* **Daily (15 min):** Workstream leads standup (blockers + decisions needed)
* **Thu Jan 8:** Mid-sprint review (decisions + scope trims)
* **Fri Jan 16:** Sprint demo (deliverables shipped) + retro (what to kill, automate, or delegate)

---

# Dependencies / Decisions Needed This Sprint

* CEO/CFO: approve **Delegation of Authority** + risk appetite (LoL caps / indemnity stance)
* Security/IT: confirm incident response roles + data inventory inputs
* Sales/RevOps: top 10 deals list + current bottlenecks
* Comms/People: spokesperson(s) + internal distribution lists

---

# Top Risks (and how we blunt them)

* **Decision latency** → enforce 48-hour decision SLA for “exec-needed” items
* **Scope creep** → intake freeze + strict Green/Yellow/Red triage
* **Missing data inventory** → start with “known systems” and iterate; don’t wait for perfection
