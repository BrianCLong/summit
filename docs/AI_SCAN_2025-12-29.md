Recent activity indicates a moderate level of development, with a few open issues and pull requests. Upon reviewing the repository, it appears that error handling and testing are areas that require attention. The project could benefit from additional unit tests and more robust error handling mechanisms.\n\n## Priority Issues\n1. Improve error handling in the `cmd/summit/main.go` file to handle unexpected errors and provide more informative error messages.\n2. Enhance testing coverage for the `internal/pkg` package to ensure that all functions are properly tested and validated.\n", "commit_message": "docs: AI repository scan 2025-12-24"}
