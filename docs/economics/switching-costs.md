# Switching Costs (Benign Lock-in)

> **Thesis:** Summit creates retention through "Wisdom Lock-in," not data hostage-taking.

## The Good vs. Bad Lock-in

- **Bad Lock-in (Hostage):** "You can't leave because we own your data format." (e.g., Proprietary DBs).
- **Benign Lock-in (Wisdom):** "You _can_ leave, but you'd be leaving behind your accumulated intelligence." (e.g., Google Search personalization, Netflix algorithms).

Summit aims exclusively for Benign Lock-in.

## The Wisdom Assets

When a customer considers leaving Summit, they aren't just migrating data (which is easy via our open APIs). They are abandoning:

1.  **Policy Maturity:** The hundreds of auto-tuned thresholds and exceptions that make their governance "quiet."
    - _Cost of Exit:_ Returning to a noisy, high-false-positive environment.

2.  **Evidence Continuity:** The unbroken chain of custody for every artifact.
    - _Cost of Exit:_ A gap in the audit trail that auditors hate.

3.  **Decision Memory:** The repository of "Why we did X" that prevents history from repeating.
    - _Cost of Exit:_ Brain drain. New staff lose access to institutional history.

4.  **Operational Reflexes:** The automated runbooks and self-healing scripts that have learned the specific quirks of their infrastructure.
    - _Cost of Exit:_ Manual toil returns.

## Economic Effect on Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)

### 1. Low Churn

- As **Decision Capital** grows, the utility gap between Summit and a competitor widens.
- Competitors effectively restart the "Learning Curve" from zero.

### 2. High Renewal Confidence

- Renewals aren't based on "promises"; they are based on the **Decision Capital Ledger**. "Look at the 5,000 incidents we avoided this year."

### 3. Price Inelasticity

- Because the value compounds, customers are less sensitive to price. The "Moat" is the accumulated intelligence, which is priceless.

## Artifact: Wisdom Retention Index

To quantify this, we track:

- **% Decisions with Reusable Memory:** How often does the system save you work?
- **Evidence Lineage Depth:** How far back can you prove compliance?
- **Policy Maturity Score:** How customized is the "immune system"?

## The Pitch

"You can export your data anytime. But you can't export the _context_ that makes that data useful."
