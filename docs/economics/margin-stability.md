# Operating Margin Stability

> **Thesis:** Summit converts the volatility of IT operations into a predictable, forecastable cost structure.

## The Volatility Problem

For a CFO, IT/Engineering is a "Black Box" of risk:

- **Variable Cost Spikes:** Cloud bills explode due to a bad config.
- **Incident Reserves:** "We need $2M in contingency for the next breach."
- **Compliance Surprises:** "The audit failed, we need 10 contractors NOW."

This variance kills valuations. Public markets hate unpredictability.

## The Summit Stabilizer

### 1. Governance as a Shock Absorber

- **Mechanism:** Resource Quotas and Budget Policies are enforced at the code level (Policy-as-Code).
- **Effect:** A bad deployment cannot blow the budget. It is blocked _before_ it spins up 1,000 GPUs.
- **Economic Impact:** Cloud spend variance drops. Forecast accuracy improves.

### 2. Learning Curves Improve Efficiency

- **Mechanism:** **Decision Capital** reduces the labor required for repetitive tasks.
- **Effect:** You don't need to hire linearly with growth. One engineer can manage 10x more services because the "wisdom" handles the routine.
- **Economic Impact:** OpEx margins expand as revenue grows (operating leverage).

### 3. Risk Quantification

- **Mechanism:** The **Risk Ledger** provides a real-time, quantitative view of exposure.
- **Effect:** Instead of "unknown unknowns," you have "calculated risks."
- **Economic Impact:** Lower reserves needed. Capital is freed up for innovation.

## The Model: Operating Margin Stabilization

We track the **Standard Deviation of Monthly Ops Spend** (Variance).

- **Pre-Summit:** High variance. Spiky. Hard to predict.
- **Post-Summit:** Low variance. Smooth. Highly predictable.

### Metrics

- **Forecast Accuracy:** (Actual Spend / Forecasted Spend). Target: 98%.
- **Margin Expansion:** Rate at which OpEx grows relative to Revenue. Target: OpEx grows at 0.5x of Revenue.
- **Incident Reserve Ratio:** $ held for emergencies vs. total budget.

## Executive Pitch

"Summit turns IT from a casino into a bond. Predictable, stable, and yielding returns."
