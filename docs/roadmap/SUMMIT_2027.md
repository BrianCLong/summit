# Summit 2027: The Autonomous Intelligence Era

## Vision 2027
By 2027, IntelGraph will evolve from an investigative tool into a **Self-Evolving Cognitive Fabric** that autonomously anticipates threats, heals its own infrastructure, and federates global intelligence without compromising privacy.

## Major Milestones

### Q1 2027: AGI-Ready Data Spine
- **Semantic Consistency Engine**: Fully automated ontology mapping for any new data source.
- **Bitemporal Knowledge Retrieval**: Travel through graph history with nanosecond precision.
- **Quantum-Resistant Identity**: Full deployment of PQC for all inter-service and partner communication.

### Q2 2027: Global Federated Graph
- **Sovereign Mesh Query**: Query cross-region and cross-jurisdiction graphs without moving raw data (using DP-guarded federated join).
- **Air-Gapped Bridge v3**: Secure, unidirectional data one-way sync for ultra-secure environments.
- **Edge-Scale Reasoning**: Move GNN inference to edge nodes for real-time local intelligence.

### Q3 2027: Autonomous Cyber Defense
- **Self-Remediating Infrastructure**: Infrastructure that predicts failures and reprovisions itself before downtime occurs.
- **Adversarial Simulation Loops**: Continuous, automated "Red-Team" agents that test platform defenses 24/7.
- **Policy-as-Code Evolution**: LLM-driven policy generation that adapts to new regulatory requirements (GDPR v3, etc.) automatically.

### Q4 2027: Universal Ecosystem
- **Summit Marketplace**: A certified exchange for OSINT connectors, custom agents, and investigative runbooks.
- **Institutional Trust Bridge**: Direct, cryptographically-proven evidence handoff to law enforcement and regulatory bodies.
- **The Singularity Achievement**: Achievement of sub-second global correlation across 1B+ nodes.
