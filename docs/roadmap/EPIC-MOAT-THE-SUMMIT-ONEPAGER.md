# One-Pager: Summit – The Governed Multi-Agent Operating System

**Executive Summary**
The enterprise market is flooded with "build-your-own-agent" frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen) that prioritize speed over safety. Summit defines a new category: the **Governed Multi-Agent Operating System**. We are moating our platform by treating agents not as chat features, but as **secure, auditable workforce units** operating within a graph-native "secure facility."

**The Problem: The "Wild West" of Agentic AI**
Enterprises want autonomous agents to automate complex workflows (compliance, intelligence, remediation), but they are stalled by:
1.  **Security Risks:** Agents acting as "insider threats" (prompt injection, data exfiltration).
2.  **Lack of Governance:** No audit trail of *why* an agent made a decision.
3.  **Hallucination:** Agents grounding decisions in probabilistic text rather than deterministic facts.

**The Summit Solution: A Secure Operating System for Autonomy**
Summit provides the "kernel" that manages agent permissions, memory, and execution. We don't just run agents; we **contain, monitor, and audit** them.

## Core Differentiators (The Moat)

| Feature | Generic Frameworks (LangChain/MSFT) | Summit Agentic OS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grounding** | Vector DBs (Text Snippets) | **Enterprise Graph (Knowledge + Lineage)** |
| **Security** | API Keys & Prompts | **Cryptographic Proof of Action & Identity** |
| **Control** | "Human-in-the-loop" (Manual) | **Policy-as-Code Governance Layer** |
| **Audit** | Chat Logs | **Immutable Decision Ledger (Blockchain-lite)** |

## Strategic Pillars

1.  **Security Scopes (The "Clearance Level" Model)**
    Agents are assigned specific **Scopes (0-3)** based on risk. A "Level 2" remediation agent *cannot* access "Level 3" financial systems, enforced by the kernel, not just the prompt.

2.  **Graph-Native Memory**
    Summit agents don't just "read documents." They traverse the **IntelGraph**—a semantic network of entities, events, and relationships. This grounds every decision in structured reality, reducing hallucination to near zero.

3.  **Governance Fabric**
    Every tool call, reasoning step, and state change is cryptographically signed and logged to the **Provenance Ledger**. Auditors can replay an agent's entire decision tree to verify compliance (SOC2, ISO, FedRAMP).

## Why This Wins**
Competitors are building "faster horses" (better LLM inference). Summit is building the **railroad**—the secure, governed infrastructure required to run the global economy's autonomous workforce. We become the **default choice for regulated industries** (Finance, Defense, Healthcare) where "move fast and break things" is not an option.
