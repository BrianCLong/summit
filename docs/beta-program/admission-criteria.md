# Beta Admission Criteria

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- **Tech-Forward**: Willing to experiment with early-stage technology.
- **Problem-Aware**: Clearly understands the problem the beta feature solves.
- **Resilient**: Can tolerate occasional bugs or API changes.

## Qualification Questions
1. Do you have a dedicated engineering contact for this pilot?
2. Are you willing to provide weekly feedback?
3. Do you understand this feature is not yet covered by our standard SLA?

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Mission-critical dependence, strict regulatory requirements (that beta doesn't meet yet).
- **Acceptable Risk**: Internal tools, non-blocking workflows, data that can be re-processed.

## Support Commitment
- Must agree to use the dedicated Slack channel/Email alias.
- Must acknowledge "Best Effort" response times outside of critical blockers.
