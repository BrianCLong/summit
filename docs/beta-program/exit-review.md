# Beta Exit Review

## Triggers
- Pilot period ends (e.g., 30 days).
- Usage goals met.
- Critical feedback addressed.

## Decision Criteria
1. **Expand (GA)**: Customer is happy, feature is stable. Move to GA pricing/contract.
2. **Renew (Extend Pilot)**: Feature needs more work, but value is projected. Extend pilot 30 days.
3. **Reference**: Customer willing to be a reference case study.
4. **Fix First**: Critical issues prevent expansion. Pilot paused until fixed.

## Actions
- **If Expand**: Trigger "Commercialization Path" (Epic 7) workflows.
- **If Fix First**: Add blocking issues to "Rapid Patch Lane".
