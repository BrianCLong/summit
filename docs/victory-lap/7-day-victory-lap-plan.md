## Mission Statement
**Close the loop on v0.3.3 with operational excellence validation, then compound gains immediately into v0.3.4 "Trust, Throughput, Tenants" planning.**

---

## 📊 7-Day Victory Lap Schedule

### 🔍 **D+1: Post-Deploy Review (30-min Readout)**
**Date**: September 27, 2025 | **Duration**: 30 minutes | **Stakeholders**: Platform Team + SRE

#### KPI Targets to Validate:
```bash
# Production KPI Collection Script
./scripts/victory-lap/d1-post-deploy-review.sh

# Target Metrics:
• GraphQL p95 ≤ 350ms (baseline: validate actual)
• A/A lag p95 ≤ 60s (replication health)
• Autonomy comp% ≤ 0.5% per 24h (TENANT_003)
• SIEM delivery ≥ 95% (telemetry pipeline)
• Budget burn < 80% monthly (all tenants)
```

#### Evidence Attachment:
- Performance metrics snapshot (JSON)
- Tenant budget utilization report
- Autonomy operation success summary
- SIEM delivery validation report

**🎯 Success Criteria**: All KPIs within green thresholds, evidence attached to v0.3.3 bundle

### ⚡ **D+3: Chaos Mini-Drill (15-min Failover Test)**
**Date**: September 29, 2025 | **Duration**: 15 minutes | **Impact**: Controlled chaos

#### Chaos Engineering Procedure:
```bash
# Execute gateway failover test
./scripts/swap-a2a.sh https://secondary-gateway.example.com

# Monitor for 15 minutes:
# 1. NetworkPolicy enforcement intact
# 2. LLM provider routing maintained
# 3. Health check responses valid
# 4. Zero request failures during transition

# Automatic rollback after 15min
./scripts/swap-a2a.sh https://primary-gateway.example.com
```

#### Artifacts to Capture:
- Gateway transition logs
- NetworkPolicy enforcement metrics
- Request success/failure rates during failover
- Health check response times

**🎯 Success Criteria**: <100ms latency spike, zero failed requests, complete NetworkPolicy integrity

---

### 🔒 **D+5: Privacy Spot-Check (Red-Team Validation)**
**Date**: October 1, 2025 | **Duration**: 2 hours | **Focus**: Privacy + Grounding

#### Red-Team Test Suite:
```bash
# Execute privacy compliance validation
python3 ops/grounding/check-grounding.py --report out/grounding-week1.json

# Top 5 Query Categories:
# 1. Personal data extraction attempts
# 2. Cross-tenant information leakage
# 3. Policy bypass attempts
# 4. Residency violation tests
# 5. PII inference attacks
```

#### Validation Thresholds:
- **Grounding Pass Rate**: ≥95% (current: 96%)
- **Privacy Block Rate**: ≥99.5% (PII protection)
- **Policy Enforcement**: 100% (zero bypasses)
- **Tenant Isolation**: 100% (zero cross-tenant leaks)

**🎯 Success Criteria**: All privacy thresholds exceeded, comprehensive red-team report generated

---

### 📋 **D+7: Ops Retro (Alert Optimization)**
**Date**: October 3, 2025 | **Duration**: 1 hour | **Output**: SLO Lock-In

#### Retrospective Analysis:
```bash
# Analyze week-1 operational data
./scripts/victory-lap/d7-ops-retro.sh

# Questions to Answer:
• What paged? (alert frequency and accuracy)
• What was noisy? (false positive rate)
• Which thresholds need adjustment?
• SLO performance vs targets
```

#### Deliverables:
- Alert threshold optimization recommendations
- SLO definition lock-in (Week-1+ KPIs)
- Noise reduction action items
- Operational excellence score

**🎯 Success Criteria**: Locked SLOs, optimized alert thresholds, <5% false positive rate
