# Executive Deck (6–8 Slides)

## Slide 1 — Why Now
- Intelligence workflows are fragmented, slow, and hard to audit.
- Regulatory, mission, and board scrutiny demand evidence-first operations.
- Summit/IntelGraph delivers governed speed without sacrificing security.

## Slide 2 — What It Is
- AI-augmented intelligence analysis + orchestration platform.
- Provenance-first execution with policy-native governance.
- Designed for cloud, on-prem, and air-gapped operations.

## Slide 3 — How It Works
- Ingest → analyze → decide → act with signed, verifiable steps.
- OPA/ABAC policies enforce access and data handling in-line.
- Audit and evidence are captured as part of the workflow, not after.

## Slide 4 — Differentiators
- Provenance-first evidence with immutable audit logs.
- Multi-tenant policy isolation and governed exceptions.
- Offline continuity with deterministic resync.
- Readiness rails and gates tied to the Summit Readiness Assertion.

## Slide 5 — Proof & Readiness
- GA readiness board plan with SLO, provenance, and separation gates.
- Signed artifacts + SBOM attestation posture.
- Evidence-first compliance and audit continuity.

## Slide 6 — Pilot Offer
- 6–8 week paid pilot with hard success criteria.
- 3 workflows live, SLOs met, provenance verified, security review passed.
- Output: evidence pack + expansion quote.

## Slide 7 — Pricing & Packages
- Team / Business / Enterprise with hard gates.
- Tenancy isolation, audit retention, BYOK/HSM, air-gap patterns, SLA tiers.
- Expansion ramp Year 1 → Year 3 with defined thresholds.

## Slide 8 — Next Steps
- Schedule 15-minute executive demo.
- Confirm pilot sponsor + security lead.
- Lock workflows and success metrics.
