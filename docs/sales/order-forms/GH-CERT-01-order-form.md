### Day-14 Proof Plan

2. **Day 6–10:** Enable SLSA signing pipeline, validate canary branch protection, capture access review log.
3. **Day 11–14:** Launch public/private badge page, deliver attestation packet, train team on updates.

### Ongoing Delivery (Post Day 14)
- Monthly badge refresh with automated SBOM + SLSA verification.
- Quarterly access review reminders and evidence upload.
- Upsell briefing for SBOM/SLSA (SEC-02) and Disclosure Pack (DP-01).

## Commercials

## Success Criteria
