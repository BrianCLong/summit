**Customer:** ********\*\*\*\*********\_********\*\*\*\*********  
**Date:** ********\*\*\*\*********\_********\*\*\*\*********  
**Prepared by:** Summit Revenue Ops  
**Engagement Term:** Month-to-month with 30-day cancellation notice.

## Scope of Work

### Objectives

- Stop surprise LLM/GPU cloud spend during pilot and pre-production phases.
- Deliver executive-ready cost transparency and enforced guardrails inside 14 days.

### Day-14 Proof Plan

1. **Day 0–3:** Connect billing sources (AWS/Azure/GCP), set per-project budget caps, configure cost-per-request tagging.
2. **Day 4–7:** Launch live dashboards (per model, per workspace) and enable anomaly detection thresholds.
3. **Day 8–14:** Trigger simulated overage, deliver anomaly alert with recommended action, publish monthly attestation pack.

### Ongoing Delivery (Post Day 14)

- Maintain dashboards, update budget caps, refine anomaly thresholds.
- Issue monthly cost attestation and savings summary.
- Surface upsell recommendations (Eval Harness AIE-01, Audit Trail AIG-01).

## Commercials

- **Setup Fee:** $2,000 due at signing (non-refundable).
- **Subscription:** $1,000 per month, invoiced in advance.
- **Savings Share:** 10% of verified monthly savings, capped at $3,000 per month.
- **Payment Terms:** Net 15 days from invoice date.

## Success Criteria

- Cost guardrails active and tested within 14 days of kickoff.
- Dashboard adoption: at least two stakeholder logins recorded by Day 14.
- Documented anomaly alert and remediation recommendation delivered.
- Monthly attestation accepted by customer FinOps or engineering lead.

## Assumptions & Dependencies

- Customer provides read-only access to relevant cloud billing accounts within 2 business days.
- Customer designates a FinOps/engineering owner for weekly 30-minute syncs.
- Summit will leverage existing tagging/metadata; new tagging support is out of scope beyond advisory.

## Change Requests

Adjustments beyond the defined deliverables require a written change order and may impact pricing and timeline.
