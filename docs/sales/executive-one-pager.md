# Executive One-Pager (Commercial + Government)

## Commercial Variant

### Problem
Enterprise intelligence workflows are fragmented across tools, teams, and policies, creating slow decisions, hidden risk, and unpriced compliance exposure.

### Outcomes
- Compress time-to-decision from days to minutes with governed, AI-augmented workflows.
- Increase analyst throughput with provenance-first evidence packs that stand up to audit.
- Cut integration and operational drag with a unified orchestration substrate.

### Differentiators
- **Provenance-first execution:** Every action is signed, logged, and verifiable.
- **Policy-native governance:** OPA/ABAC guardrails enforce tenant isolation and data handling in-line.
- **Offline-ready operations:** Disconnected workflows with deterministic resync and audit continuity.
- **Evidence-grade readiness:** Summit Readiness Assertion binds claims to verifiable artifacts.

### Proof
- GA readiness rails and gates validated with SLOs, provenance verification, and policy export guards.
- Evidence-first governance and audit trails are embedded in the platform design.

### Security Posture
- Zero-trust access control, encryption in transit/at rest, immutable audit logs, and signed artifacts.
- Explicit support for cloud, on-prem, and air-gapped deployment patterns.

### Next Step
Schedule a 15-minute executive demo followed by a 6–8 week paid pilot with defined success criteria and an evidence pack for internal approvals.

## Government / IC Variant

### Problem
Mission workflows are split across systems and compartments, creating delays, provenance gaps, and risk in sensitive operations.

### Outcomes
- Deliver verifiable intelligence outcomes with chain-of-custody provenance.
- Enforce compartmented policy controls without slowing operations.
- Maintain offline continuity with deterministic resync and audit integrity.

### Differentiators
- **Provenance-first disclosure:** Evidence is captured at every step, not after the fact.
- **Multi-tenant policy isolation:** Policy-enforced boundaries across mission lanes.
- **Offline case sync:** Field operability with secure resynchronization.
- **Governed exceptions:** Legacy constraints are handled as governed exceptions, not hidden workarounds.

### Proof
- GA readiness plan and rails established for provenance gates, separation checks, and offline drills.
- Signed artifacts and SBOM attestation posture are asserted in the readiness bundle.

### Security Posture
- Policy-as-code enforcement, signed artifacts, and immutable audit logs.
- Deployment options: cloud, on-prem, air-gap with evidence continuity.

### Next Step
Authorize a paid pilot with mission-aligned workflows, security review, and a formal evidence pack for acquisition and accreditation.
