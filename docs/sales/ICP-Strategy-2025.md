## Segment Narratives

### Segment 1: Government / Defense / Intelligence

**Overview**: This segment represents our core heritage and highest-value opportunities. Agencies face mounting pressure to "connect the dots" across fragmented data sources while maintaining strict security and compliance standards. Recent high-profile intelligence failures and budget allocations toward AI/ML modernization create significant tailwinds.

**Key Insights**:
- **Buying Cycles**: 12-24 months from first contact to contract award; requires sustained engagement through RFI → RFP → evaluation → award
- **Average Contract Value**: $2M-$50M (multi-year IDIQ)
- **Decision Drivers**: Security clearances, FedRAMP/IL-5 compliance, incumbent relationships, mission impact
- **Competitive Landscape**: Palantir (dominant incumbent), BAH/CACI (SI-led), legacy tools (i2 Analyst Notebook, Analyst's Notebook)

**Winning Strategy**:
1. **Lead with mission outcomes**: Faster threat detection, analyst force multiplier, zero compliance violations
2. **Proof points**: Pilot with friendly agency, veteran/cleared team, FedRAMP in progress
3. **Partnership model**: Teaming with Primes (Booz Allen, CACI) for large procurements, direct for smaller agencies
4. **Differentiation**: Deployability (air-gapped, edge), AI-augmented insights (vs. manual Palantir), modern UX

---

### Segment 2: Prime Contractors & System Integrators

**Overview**: This segment offers **channel leverage**—one successful OEM partnership can generate $10M+ in recurring revenue via their customer base. Primes are under pressure to differentiate in competitive bids and avoid "science project" risk of custom builds.

**Key Insights**:
- **Buying Cycles**: 3-6 months for OEM/partnership evaluation; tied to specific opportunity pursuits
- **Average Deal Value**: $500K-$5M annual license fees (OEM); $50K-$200K for specific opportunity support
- **Decision Drivers**: Win rate impact, time-to-demo, integration ease, commercial terms (rev share, reseller margin)
- **Competitive Landscape**: Build in-house, acquire small tech companies, resell existing tools (Palantir, Splunk)

**Winning Strategy**:
1. **Opportunity-driven engagement**: "We can help you win [specific RFP] by providing turnkey graph analytics"
2. **Fast proof of value**: 30-day demo environment, golden path workflow for their use case
3. **Commercial flexibility**: OEM, reseller, co-sell, professional services models
4. **Technical enablement**: Partner portal, sales engineering support, co-branded collateral

**Top Partner Archetypes**:
- **Tier 1 SIs** (Booz Allen, CACI, Leidos): OEM for large IC contracts; focus on "unfair advantage" in competitive evals
- **Cloud Hyperscalers** (AWS, Microsoft, Google): Marketplace listing, co-sell, reference architecture

- **Average Contract Value**: $500K-$3M annually (enterprise licenses for 50-500 investigators)
- **Decision Drivers**: Regulatory risk, fraud loss reduction, analyst efficiency, integration with core systems (TM, SAR filing)
- **Competitive Landscape**: Actimize (NICE), SAS, Quantexa, legacy rules engines

**Winning Strategy**:
1. **Lead with compliance**: "Immutable audit trail for examiners," "automated SAR evidence gathering"
2. **Quantify ROI**: "70% faster case resolution = $5M savings on investigator FTEs," "10% reduction in false positives = 50% more capacity"
3. **Proof of concept**: 60-day POC with real transaction data, anonymized customer entities
4. **Integration story**: Pre-built connectors to core banking, TM systems (Actimize, AML RightSource)

**Key Insights**:
- **Buying Cycles**: 3-6 months (grant-dependent)
- **Average Contract Value**: $25K-$150K annually (sliding scale, academic pricing)
- **Decision Drivers**: Impact per dollar, ease of use, collaboration features, data security
- **Competitive Landscape**: Free tools (Gephi, Maltego Community), commercial (Palantir NGO program, Kumu)

**Winning Strategy**:
1. **Mission-aligned pricing**: 75-90% discount vs. commercial, tiered by budget size
2. **Showcase impact**: "OCCRP used Summit to map $2B corruption network in 6 weeks"
3. **Community building**: User conferences, training workshops, shared methodologies
4. **Grant support**: Co-author proposals, provide technical specifications for funder RFPs

**Top Use Cases**:
- **Corruption investigations**: Beneficial ownership, offshore entities, political connections
- **Conflict research**: Arms trafficking, sanctions evasion, war crimes evidence
- **Human rights**: Corporate accountability, supply chain labor abuse
- **Disinformation**: Influence networks, bot detection, narrative tracking

**Strategic Value**:
