# 3-Email Outreach Sequence (Pilot CTA)

## Email 1 — Outcome + Proof
**Subject:** Provenance-first intelligence workflows in weeks, not quarters

Hi {{FirstName}},

You’re likely seeing the same pattern we see across regulated teams: fragmented intelligence workflows create slow decisions, hidden risk, and audit gaps. Summit/IntelGraph fixes that by making provenance and policy enforcement native—so every action is verifiable, not reconstructed later.

**Outcomes we deliver:**
- 3 mission workflows live in 6–8 weeks
- Verified audit trail + evidence pack
- Security review passed without rework

If you’re open to a 15-minute executive demo, I’ll show the workflow-to-evidence path and the readiness rails that make security say yes.

Are you available {{TwoTimes}}?

## Email 2 — Security Posture + Readiness
**Subject:** Security can say “yes” faster — here’s how

Hi {{FirstName}},

We designed Summit/IntelGraph so security can approve faster without exceptions:
- Policy-as-code enforcement (OPA/ABAC)
- Signed artifacts, SBOM attestation, immutable audit logs
- Offline/air-gap ready with deterministic resync

We ship a standard paid pilot with hard gates: 3 workflows live, SLOs met, provenance verified, security review passed, and one connector validated. The output is a customer-ready evidence pack.

If you want the pilot one-pager, I can send it or walk through it live.

## Email 3 — Pilot CTA + Scarcity
**Subject:** Locking pilot slots for {{Quarter}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

We’re opening a limited number of paid pilots this quarter. The format is fixed so you can predict outcomes: 6–8 weeks, success criteria, evidence pack, and expansion quote.

If this is relevant, reply “pilot” and I’ll send the scope sheet and schedule the alignment call.
