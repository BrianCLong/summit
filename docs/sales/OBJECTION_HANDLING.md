# Objection Handling Guide

Use these responses when faced with competitor-related pushback from prospects.

## General Positioning

> "We are not another platform for workflows or catalogs. We are the **policy, provenance, and evidence layer** that makes automation safe for the enterprise."

---

### Objection: "We already have ServiceNow."

**Response:** "Keep it. We sit underneath as the **policy + provenance + evidence layer** that makes automations safe and auditable across systems. ServiceNow doesn’t give you universal, cryptographically-verifiable receipts across _every tool_."

### Objection: "We use Backstage / Port / OpsLevel."

**Response:** "Great—our Switchboard becomes the **approval + evidence + policy gate** for actions. We can ingest your existing catalogs and scorecards while adding verifiable receipts and multi-tenant cost attribution to every action taken."

### Objection: "We use Vanta / Drata."

**Response:** "Excellent tools for compliance tracking. Summit replaces the brittle manual evidence stitching with **native receipts** from every action and workflow. We produce auditor-ready bundles automatically, so you don't have to hunt for screenshots."

### Objection: "AI tools can't touch our sensitive data."

**Response:** "We agree—that's why our agents only operate through **policy-bound tools**. We provide allowlists, granular audit logs, and selective disclosure receipts to ensure data stays within your control while still getting the benefits of agentic automation."

### Objection: "Is this just another graph database?"

**Response:** "No. While we use a graph for mission context, we are an **operational intelligence platform**. The graph is the engine that allows us to track relationships and provenance at a level of detail that traditional databases cannot match, all governed by enterprise-grade policy."
