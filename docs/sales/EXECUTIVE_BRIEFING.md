# Executive Briefing: The Systemic Risk Era

**Audience:** C-Suite, Regulators, Defense Attachés

## 1. The Problem: Disinformation is Obsolete
You are fighting "disinformation" (content). The enemy is deploying "systemic risk" (coordination).
*   Content modulation fails against AI swarms.
*   Binary attribution fails in hybrid warfare.

## 2. The Solution: Summit IntelGraph
Summit is not a tool; it is an **Intelligence Operating System**.
*   **Systemic Risk Index (SRI):** We quantify stability, not just count bots.
*   **Conflict Mode:** Pre-configured intelligence profiles for fragile states (e.g., Sudan).
*   **Evidence-First:** Every pixel of analysis is backed by a cryptographic proof.

## 3. The Ask
Stop buying tools. Start building institutional immune systems.
Deploy Summit to:
1.  Detect coordinated swarms (DISARM-aligned).
2.  Model downstream risk to elections/markets.
3.  Automate response within governance confidence bands.
