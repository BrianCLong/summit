# 15-Minute Demo Script (Mission/Analyst • Security • Procurement)

## Setup (Pre-Demo)
- Open with the Executive One-Pager and the GA readiness board one-pager.
- Confirm the target workflows and required evidence outputs.

---

## 0:00–2:00 — Mission/Analyst View (Outcome First)
**Goal:** Show workflow-to-evidence speed.

**Talk Track**
- “Here’s a live mission workflow from intake to decision.”
- “Every action produces provenance so the evidence pack is automatic.”
- “We reduce time-to-decision while making outputs audit-grade.”

**Show**
- Workflow intake → analysis → action with evidence capture.

---

## 2:00–6:00 — Mission/Analyst Deep Dive (Differentiators)
**Goal:** Demonstrate the workflow advantage.

**Talk Track**
- “Policy enforcement is inline, not an afterthought.”
- “Offline operations are supported with deterministic resync.”
- “Governed exceptions let you handle legacy constraints without risk.”

**Show**
- Evidence trail, task lineage, and provenance metadata.

---

## 6:00–10:00 — Security View (Approval Path)
**Goal:** Make security say yes faster.

**Talk Track**
- “OPA/ABAC enforces access at every step.”
- “Signed artifacts, SBOM attestations, immutable audit logs.”
- “Evidence pack maps directly to internal controls and reviews.”

**Show**
- Policy enforcement panel, audit logs, and evidence bundle structure.

---

## 10:00–13:00 — Procurement View (Commercial Clarity)
**Goal:** Make the purchase path deterministic.

**Talk Track**
- “Standard paid pilot: 6–8 weeks, fixed scope, hard success criteria.”
- “Deliverables include an evidence pack and a 3-year expansion ramp.”
- “Package gates define tenancy, audit retention, BYOK/HSM, SLA tiers.”

**Show**
- Pilot success criteria checklist and package gate summary.

---

## 13:00–15:00 — Close (Next Step)
**Goal:** Convert to pilot.

**Talk Track**
- “We can start with three workflows and deliver the evidence pack.”
- “Confirm pilot sponsor and security lead to lock scope.”
- “We will send the pilot one-pager and schedule the alignment call.”

**Close**
- Schedule pilot alignment meeting and assign owners.
