# Governance Ledger

This directory contains the immutable records of release parity scorecards and drift checks.

## Structure

*   `<release-tag>/`: Directory for a specific release.
    *   `parity-scorecard.json`: Machine-readable evidence of preview vs prod parity.
    *   `plan.json`: Terraform plan for the preview environment.
    *   `flags.json`: Feature flags export.
    *   `images.json`: Image digests list.

## Usage

These artifacts are generated by the `deploy-preview` workflow and used to gate General Availability (GA) releases.
Drift between preview and production (outside of allowed policy) will block the release.
