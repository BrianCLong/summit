# 🧬 Evolution Atlas

This atlas maps the temporal dimension of the ecosystem: its history, its current trajectory, and its future destiny.

## 📅 The Sprint Timeline

The project evolution is quantized into **Sprints**, documented in `docs/sprints/`.

### 🏁 Recent History
*   **Sprint 21-25:** PsyOps & Influence Operations (Backend Services).
*   **Sprint 26-30:** Information Warfare Series (Defense & Simulation).
*   **Sprint 11-15:** Foundation Hardening.

### 📍 Current Era: The "Cartography & Consolidation" Phase
We are currently in a phase of high-level integration, mapping, and stabilization.
*   **Focus:** Making the implicit explicit (Atlases).
*   **Goal:** "Holistic Ecosystem" awareness.

### 🔮 Future Horizons (Q4 2025 & Beyond)
*   **Parallel Strategic Sprints:**
    1.  **Observability:** Full system transparency (SLO Exporter).
    2.  **Security:** Zero Trust enforcement.
    3.  **Data Pipeline:** Robust graph ingestion.
    4.  **Frontend:** Advanced Analyst Experience.
    5.  **AI/ML:** Auto-Scientist and Cognitive Agents.

## 📜 The Archives (Legacy)

Evolution implies shedding the old.

*   **`docs/LEGACY.md`**: Inventory of retired code.
*   **`archive/`**: The graveyard of superseded implementations.
*   **Why we keep them:** For provenance and "genetic memory" — understanding *why* we moved away helps us stay on the new path.

## 🚀 Roadmap Milestones

### 1. The Provable Value Slice (PVS)
*   **Goal:** End-to-end flow from "User Problem" to "Decision" backed by Evidence.
*   **Status:** In Progress.

### 2. The Auto-Scientist
*   **Goal:** Autonomous generation of intellectual property and research.
*   **Status:** Prototyping (`auto_scientist/`).

### 3. The Singularity (Concept)
*   **Goal:** The point where the system can self-improve faster than human intervention.
*   **Status:** Aspirational.

## 🧬 Evolutionary Principles
1.  **Deployable First:** The system must always be in a shippable state.
2.  **Provenance:** Every evolutionary step is recorded in the Ledger.
3.  **Consolidation:** We expand (explore), then contract (consolidate/refactor). We are currently in a **Consolidation** cycle.
