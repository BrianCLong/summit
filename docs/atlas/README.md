# 🗺️ System Atlases

**Welcome to the Cartographer's Room.**

This directory contains the master maps of the Summit Ecosystem, maintained by **Jules (The Cartographer)**. These atlases are designed to make the invisible structure of the system visible, navigable, and understandable.

## 📚 The Atlases

### 1. [Prompt Atlas](./PROMPT_ATLAS.md)
*   **What it is:** A map of the "software for the mind" — the prompts that define our agents.
*   **Use it to:** Find the right prompt for a task, understand agent personas, and explore the cognitive layer.

### 2. [Agent Atlas](./AGENT_ATLAS.md)
*   **What it is:** A Who's Who of the ecosystem.
*   **Use it to:** Understand the specialized roles (Jules, Claude, Codex, etc.) and how they collaborate in the Council of Solvers.

### 3. [Architecture Atlas](./ARCHITECTURE_ATLAS.md)
*   **What it is:** The blueprint of the machine.
*   **Use it to:** Navigate the directories, understand the tech stack, and trace data flows across the monorepo.

### 4. [Governance Atlas](./GOVERNANCE_ATLAS.md)
*   **What it is:** The legal code and enforcement mechanisms.
*   **Use it to:** Understand standards, policies, and the automated gates that keep the system safe.

### 5. [Evolution Atlas](./EVOLUTION_ATLAS.md)
*   **What it is:** The history and roadmap of the project.
*   **Use it to:** See where we came from (Archives), where we are (Sprints), and where we are going (Roadmap).

## compass How to Use These Maps

*   **For New Agents:** Start here to orient yourself. Understand your role in the `Agent Atlas` and finding your instructions in the `Prompt Atlas`.
*   **For Developers:** Use the `Architecture Atlas` to locate code and understand the "big picture" before diving into specific modules.
*   **For Architects:** Use these maps to identify structural gaps, circular dependencies, or "dark matter" (undocumented areas).

## 🔄 Maintenance

These atlases are **living documents**.
*   **Jules** is responsible for updating them as the system evolves.
*   **Trigger:** Any significant architectural change or new prompt addition should trigger a map update.

*"To map is to know. To know is to control."*
