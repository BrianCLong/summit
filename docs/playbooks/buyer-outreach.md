# Buyer Outreach Playbook: OSINT Summit 2026

## Overview
This playbook outlines the strategy for automated outreach to IC (Intelligence Community) analysts and Security Operations (SecOps) professionals ahead of the 2026 summits. The focus is on leveraging the "Org Mesh" and drift detection capabilities to drive demo bookings.

## Target Personas

### 1. IC Analyst (Narrative Focus)
- **Role**: Intelligence Analyst, Counter-Disinformation Specialist.
- **Pain Points**: Information overload, slow detection of emerging narratives, difficulty in mapping narratives to organizational impact.
- **Value Prop**: Real-time OSINT-driven narrative detection and drift analysis.
- **Hook**: "Org Mesh detects [emerging narrative] drift—90s demo?"

### 2. SecOps (Drift/Compliance)
- **Role**: CISO, Security Operations Manager, Compliance Officer.
- **Pain Points**: Configuration drift, shadow IT, lack of visibility into security posture changes across multi-tenant environments.
- **Value Prop**: Hardened enterprise security with automated drift detection and RBAC.
- **Hook**: "Hardened for 2026: Automated drift detection at scale."
