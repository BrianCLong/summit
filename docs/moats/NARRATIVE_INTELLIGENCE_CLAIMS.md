# Narrative Intelligence Claims Map

**What We Claim vs. What We Measure**

To maintain auditability and avoid "AI Snake Oil" accusations, Summit strictly delimits its claims regarding narrative intelligence.

| Market Claim | Technical Measurement (The Proof) | Confidence Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"We detect AI Bot Swarms."** | `SwarmSignature` > 0.85 (High Temporal Coord + High Semantic Divergence). | High (Deterministic) |
| **"We identify Disinformation."** | **WE DO NOT.** We identify *Anomalous Amplification* and *Coordination*. Truth is subjective; behavior is objective. | N/A |
| **"We predict Viral Threats."** | `PropagationPath.velocity` > organic_baseline * 3.0. | Medium (Probabilistic) |
| **"We map Foreign Influence."** | `ActorClass` attribution via known signatures + IP/Geo correlation. | Low/Medium (Requires Human Review) |
| **"We see through Censorship."** | `SuppressionInteraction.pressureBuildup` estimation. | Medium (Model-based) |

## Defensibility
Our defensive moat is built on **Behavioral Geometry** (Coordination Physics), not **Content Moderation**. We do not decide what is true; we decide what is *artificial*.
