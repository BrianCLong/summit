# Summit Observability Platform — Phase 1 Delivery Runbook

This runbook defines the operational steps, ownership, and acceptance criteria required to deliver Phase 1 (Foundation) of the Summit observability platform.

## 1. Scope

Phase 1 aligns with the "Foundation" scope from the specification and targets:

- Core error tracking & intelligent grouping.
- Real-time build pipeline visibility with stage-by-stage breakdown.
- Baseline performance monitoring (transactions, spans, frontend vitals).
- Distributed tracing ingestion with OpenTelemetry compatibility.
- Centralized logging with search and retention controls.

## 2. Cross-Functional Teams

| Team | Lead | Functional Areas | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ingestion & Edge | Priya Raman | API gateways, CI/CD agents, schema registry | Telemetry gateway, signed SDKs, schema validation pipelines |
| Data Platform | Mateo Ortiz | Kafka, Flink, ClickHouse, OpenSearch, Prometheus | Normalization jobs, storage clusters, retention policies |
| Build Intelligence | Holly Chen | Build graph, pipeline explorer, DORA metrics | Build DAG service, pipeline dashboards, flaky test detector |
| Runtime Observability | Jamal King | Error tracking, tracing, metrics ingestion | Error service, trace correlator, metrics remote-write endpoint |
| Insights & Alerting | Sofia Alvarez | Alert orchestrator, ML features, notifications | Alert routing, Slack/PagerDuty integrations, baseline ML features |
| Security & Governance | Leah Patel | RBAC, audit logs, compliance | Tenant isolation controls, audit ledger, data residency configs |

## 3. Milestone Breakdown

### Milestone A — Telemetry Ingestion Ready (Week 4)

- ✅ Kafka MSK clusters provisioned with IaC and automated scaling policies.
- ✅ Schema registry bootstrapped with canonical event envelope & build schemas.
- ✅ Ingest gateway (Go + Envoy) deployed with tenant auth, rate limiting, sampling knobs.
- ✅ GitHub Actions and Jenkins collectors emitting build events end-to-end.
- ✅ Edge privacy rules validated (PII scrubbing smoke tests).

### Milestone B — Build Intelligence MVP (Week 8)

- ✅ Build graph service deployed with GitHub Actions + CircleCI connectors.
- ✅ ClickHouse `metrics_build_v1` + `events_error_v1` populated with >10M sample events.
- ✅ Pipeline explorer dashboard showing duration trends, bottlenecks, queue times.
- ✅ Flaky test radar producing top offenders report daily.
- ✅ DORA metrics board (lead time, deployment frequency) updated via scheduled jobs.

### Milestone C — Runtime Observability (Week 10)

- ✅ Error ingestion with fingerprinting + ML-based grouping (XGBoost model v0.1).
- ✅ Trace correlator linking runtime spans to build runs & deployments.
- ✅ Metrics ingestion with Prometheus remote-write + retention policies.
- ✅ Session replay ingestion for web (100% sampling for internal tenants, 10% default otherwise).
- ✅ Alert orchestrator MVP delivering Slack & PagerDuty notifications with dedupe.

### Milestone D — Phase 1 Exit (Week 12)

- ✅ RBAC + tenant isolation validated by security pen test.
- ✅ SOC 2 control evidence for access, change management, and monitoring stored in compliance vault.
- ✅ Load test at 1M events/min sustained for 2 hours with <500ms P99 ingest latency.
- ✅ Automated regression suite (SDK + backend) green in CI.
- ✅ Customer design partners onboarded and emitting live telemetry.

## 4. Execution Steps

1. **Environment Provisioning**
   - Apply Terraform stacks for shared services (networking, MSK, EKS) in staging and production accounts.
   - Configure GitOps (ArgoCD) for continuous deployment of services.

2. **SDK & Agent Distribution**
   - Publish beta SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Java with CI instrumentation hooks.
   - Provide CLI (`summit-cli`) preview for manual event capture and debugging.

3. **Data Plane Hardening**
   - Implement ClickHouse sharding & replication (3x replication factor) with Zookeeper-less deployment.
   - Enable OpenSearch ISM policies for log retention tiers (hot 7d, warm 30d, cold 180d).

4. **Quality Gates**
   - Establish automated schema diff testing via CI (Protobuf/JSON schemas validated by `spectral`).
   - Run integration tests nightly across sample tenant datasets.

5. **Go-Live Checklist**
   - Confirm runbooks stored in `docs/observability/runbooks/` with on-call rotations assigned.
   - Schedule game day to validate failover from primary to secondary region.
   - Prepare customer onboarding kit: API keys, sample dashboards, Terraform module for configuration.

## 5. Risk Register & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kafka saturation under burst traffic | Data loss, increased latency | Auto-scaling MSK brokers, k6 stress tests, circuit breakers at gateway |
| Schema drift from SDK updates | Ingestion failures | Schema registry with compatibility checks, SDK contract tests |
| Build graph data quality gaps | Incorrect analytics | Automated reconciliation jobs, developer self-service validation tools |
| Alert noise | Alert fatigue | Adaptive thresholds, alert analytics reviews, ML feedback loop |
| Compliance audit delays | Launch slip | Early engagement with compliance team, evidence automation |

## 6. Communication Plan

- **Daily**: Standups per workstream, Slack channel `#summit-observability` for cross-team updates.
- **Weekly**: Executive sync summarizing milestone progress, risks, and burn-down metrics.
- **Bi-weekly**: Customer advisory board sessions sharing latest dashboards & collecting feedback.
- **Monthly**: Delivery review aligning KPIs, budget, and roadmap adjustments.

## 7. Documentation & Handover

- Architecture diagrams stored in `docs/observability/dashboards/` (Mermaid + exported PNG).
- Service runbooks per component with on-call procedures, SLOs, and escalation paths.
- Knowledge base articles for developers (SDK usage, CLI commands, alert tuning).
- Post-launch retrospectives captured after each release train for continuous improvement.
