# Summit Observability Platform — Delivery Blueprint

## 1. Product Vision

Summit provides "from code to customer" observability that fuses build intelligence with production telemetry. The delivery blueprint below translates the specification into a buildable system by defining architecture, service contracts, data models, and an execution plan that teams can begin implementing immediately.

## 2. Platform Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Logical Layers

| Layer | Responsibilities | Key Components |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Instrumentation & SDKs** | Capture runtime, build, and infrastructure telemetry; enforce context propagation and PI/PII controls. | Language SDKs, CI runners plugins, CLI agents, OpenTelemetry exporters |
| **Ingestion & Edge Processing** | Accept billions of events with low latency, enforce schemas, apply first-pass enrichment, sampling, and privacy scrubbing. | Global API gateways, Kafka front door clusters, edge processors (Rust), schema registry |
| **Streaming & Processing** | Normalize, enrich, correlate, and score telemetry; power ML pipelines. | Apache Flink jobs, Kafka streams, ML feature pipelines, rule engine |
| **Storage** | Persist optimized copies per access pattern (hot, warm, cold) with governance. | ClickHouse (events), OpenSearch (logs), Prometheus/Thanos (metrics), Neo4j (lineage), S3 data lake |
| **Query & Insights** | Provide APIs, dashboards, analytics, alerting, and automated insights. | GraphQL/REST API, query federation, dashboard service, alerting engine, AI insight service |
| **Experience & Integrations** | Serve developers, SREs, data science, and leadership audiences. | React web app, CLI, IDE extensions, Slack/PagerDuty integrations |

### 2.2 Deployment Topology

- **Global Edge**: CloudFront + regional API ingress with WAF, pushing data to Kafka clusters colocated in US/EU/APAC.
- **Control Plane**: Deployed on EKS (multi-region active-active) hosting orchestration services, configuration APIs, RBAC, billing, and tenant management.
- **Data Plane**: Dedicated namespaces per tenant tier; data storage isolated via AWS accounts & encryption keys (KMS).
- **Streaming Plane**: Managed Kafka on MSK with tiered storage; Flink on EKS; ML pipelines orchestrated via Argo Workflows.

## 4. Data Models & Schemas

### 4.1 Canonical Event Envelope

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "tenant_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T12:34:56.789Z",
  "type": "error|trace|metric|log|build",
  "source": {
    "service": "api-gateway",
    "environment": "prod",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "commit_sha": "f5d2...",
    "build_run_id": "build_12345"
  },
  "context": {
    "trace_id": "trace-abc",
    "span_id": "span-xyz",
    "session_id": "sess-001",
    "user": { "id": "u_42", "role": "admin" }
  },
  "payload": { "schema_ref": "summit.v1.error" }
}
```

### 4.2 Build Graph Entities (Neo4j)

```
(:BuildRun {id, pipeline, branch, commit_sha, started_at, status, duration})
(:Stage {id, name, position, status, duration})
(:Task {id, type, status, duration, agent})
(:Artifact {id, type, url, size, checksum})
(:TestSuite {id, name, status, flaky_score})

Relationships:
(BuildRun)-[:HAS_STAGE]->(Stage)
(Stage)-[:HAS_TASK]->(Task)
(Task)-[:PRODUCED]->(Artifact)
(Task)-[:COVERS]->(TestSuite)
(BuildRun)-[:TRIGGERED_BY]->(:Deployment)
```

### 4.3 ClickHouse Tables

- `events_error_v1`: partitioned by day, order by (tenant_id, timestamp). Includes stack frames, breadcrumbs, build context.
- `events_trace_v1`: spans with parent-child relationships, build correlation metadata.
- `metrics_runtime_v1`: remote-write metrics using Prometheus schema.
- `metrics_build_v1`: build/test timings, queue latency, resource utilization.
- `session_replay_v1`: blob store references to replay artifacts (S3) with indexing metadata.
