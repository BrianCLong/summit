# PsyOps Risk Assessment Matrix for Contested Information Environments

| **Threat Actor** | **Psychological Attack Vector** | **Probable Impact Zones** | **Mitigation Pathways** |
|------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **State** | Deepfakes (video/audio of executives, officials, or key events) | • Workforce morale (confusion, distrust in leadership)<br>• Investor confidence (appearance of scandal or instability)<br>• Brand trust (perceived dishonesty or unethical behavior) | • Deploy deepfake detection tools and digital watermarking<br>• Establish rapid verification channels and crisis communication protocols<br>• Preemptively brief stakeholders on potential manipulation tactics |
| **State** | Coordinated disinformation campaigns (spreading false narratives across media platforms) | • Workforce morale (uncertainty around corporate direction)<br>• Investor confidence (false rumors impacting valuation)<br>• Brand trust (misleading claims eroding reputation) | • Continuous media monitoring and third-party fact-checking partnerships<br>• Robust internal communication to clarify misinformation<br>• Transparent public statements countering false narratives |
| **State** | Cognitive load saturation (overwhelming audiences with conflicting or excessive information) | • Workforce morale (decision fatigue, stress)<br>• Investor confidence (difficulty separating signal from noise)<br>• Brand trust (perceived lack of clarity or direction) | • Simplify key messaging and prioritize essential updates<br>• Provide filtered, curated information feeds for employees and investors<br>• Train staff in information triage and stress management |
| **Non-State** | Deepfakes targeting leadership or product launches | • Workforce morale (perceived leadership missteps)<br>• Investor confidence (market disruptions)<br>• Brand trust (product safety or authenticity doubts) | • Maintain authoritative communication channels (verified social accounts, press releases)<br>• Invest in AI-based media forensics<br>• Educate stakeholders on recognizing manipulated media |
| **Non-State** | Coordinated disinformation by activist or competitor networks | • Workforce morale (misaligned priorities or perceived conflicts)<br>• Investor confidence (negative coverage affecting stock value)<br>• Brand trust (viral rumors about policies or products) | • Develop contingency plans for social-media-driven crises<br>• Engage independent auditors or reputable third parties for public validation<br>• Activate loyal customer/community networks to share verified facts |
| **Non-State** | Cognitive load saturation via spam, fake reviews, or multiple narrative threads | • Workforce morale (time wasted on filtering junk information)<br>• Investor confidence (difficulty evaluating true performance)<br>• Brand trust (confusion over competing narratives) | • Automate filtering and validation of inbound information<br>• Centralize official communication channels for employees and investors<br>• Run resilience exercises to practice navigating information overload |

## How to Use the Matrix

1. **Identify Exposure**
   - Determine which threat actors are most relevant to the organization.
2. **Assess Likelihood and Impact**
   - Rate each actor and attack vector by likelihood and severity for each impact zone using a risk matrix.
3. **Develop Mitigation Playbooks**
   - For high-priority scenarios, create detailed response plans with predefined roles, escalation procedures, and communication templates.
4. **Monitor and Adapt**
   - Revisit the matrix periodically as threat landscapes evolve and conduct simulations to refine strategies.
