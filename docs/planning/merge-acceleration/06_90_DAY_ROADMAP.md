**Generated by Jules | Date: 2025-05-20 (Simulated)**

## Objective
Reduce PR backlog by 50% and establish a "Single Source of Truth" architecture.

---

## Month 1: Stabilization & Triage
**Theme: "Stop the Bleeding"**

*   **Week 1**:
    *   [ ] Execute "Ghost Town" PR auto-closure (Target: Close 150 PRs).
    *   [ ] Delete `apps/server` and `package-lock.json`.
    *   [ ] Establish the **Merge Acceleration Protocol** (Review Windows).
*   **Week 2**:
    *   [ ] Categorize remaining 200 PRs.
    *   [ ] Assign Domain Owners.
    *   [ ] **Milestone**: Merge Velocity hits 20 PRs/week.
*   **Week 3-4**:
    *   [ ] **Refactor**: Move `server/` root folders to `server/src/modules`.
    *   [ ] **Refactor**: Audit `client/` features for migration.

## Month 2: Unification
**Theme: "One App, One Stack"**

*   **Week 5-6**:
    *   [ ] Port critical "Console" features from `client/` to `apps/web`.
    *   [ ] Archive `client/` directory.
    *   [ ] Standardize on **Zod v4** (or v3) repo-wide.
*   **Week 7-8**:
    *   [ ] **Feature Delivery**: Resume major feature work (e.g., "DeepAgent Integration") on the clean stack.
    *   [ ] **Infra**: Containerize Python services (remove `python-shell` dependency).

## Month 3: Acceleration
**Theme: "High Velocity"**

*   **Week 9-10**:
    *   [ ] Automate Dependency Updates (Renovate/Dependabot).
    *   [ ] Implement **Merge Queue** (if GitHub Enterprise) or strict gating.
*   **Week 11-12**:
    *   [ ] **Milestone**: PR Backlog < 50.
    *   [ ] **Milestone**: Average PR Lifespan < 3 days.
    *   [ ] **Milestone**: Architecture is documented and enforced by CI/Linting.
