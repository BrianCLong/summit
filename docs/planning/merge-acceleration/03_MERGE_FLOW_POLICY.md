# Merge Acceleration Protocol

**Generated by Jules | Date: 2025-05-20 (Simulated)**

## 1. Mission
To increase merge velocity from **X/week** to **3X/week** while reducing regression risk.

## 2. The Golden Rules

1.  **NO PR older than 7 days.** (It is either merged, closed, or marked "Draft").
2.  **NO PR larger than 500 lines** (excluding generated files/lockfiles).
3.  **NO Merging without CI Green.**

## 3. The New Process

### Step 1: Pre-Submission (The Author)
*   **Self-Review**: Author must comment on their own PR explaining complex logic.
*   **Context**: Description must follow the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
*   **Validation**: Must run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` locally.

### Step 2: The "Review Window" (The Team)
*   **Dedicated Block**: Tuesday & Thursday, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM.
*   **No Coding**: During this window, engineers *only* review PRs.
*   **SLA**: All PRs posted before 10 AM must have a review by 12 PM.

### Step 3: Triage & Assignment (The Bot/Lead)
*   **Frontend (`apps/web`)**: Assigned to **Team FE** (Lead: [Name]).
*   **Backend (`server/`)**: Assigned to **Team BE** (Lead: [Name]).
*   **Infra/DevOps**: Assigned to **Team Ops**.
*   **Documentation**: Auto-approve if only `.md` files change.

### Step 4: The Merge (The Machine)
*   Use a **Merge Queue** (if available) to serialize merges.
*   Otherwise, "Batch Merge" low-risk PRs at the end of the day.

## 4. Reviewer Matrix

| Domain | Primary Reviewers | Backup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Server (Node/TS)** | @backend-lead | @fullstack-dev |
| **Web (React)** | @frontend-lead | @fullstack-dev |
| **Rust (`psc-runner`)** | @rust-expert | @backend-lead |
| **Python (`auto_scientist`)** | @ml-engineer | @data-scientist |
| **Infrastructure** | @devops | @backend-lead |

## 5. Escalation Path

If a PR is stuck for >48 hours:
1.  **Ping #dev-reviews** on Slack.
2.  **Tag the Engineering Manager**.
3.  **"Break Glass"**: If it blocks a release, the EM can override approval (with post-merge review required).
