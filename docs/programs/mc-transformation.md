# MC Platform Transformation Program

## Program Overview
- **Objective:** Deliver AI-native orchestration, autonomous control plane, and unified developer experience.
- **Timeline:** 3-quarter initiative with rolling deployments aligned to Q2-Q4 roadmap milestones.
- **Executive Sponsors:** VP Platform Engineering, Head of Developer Experience.

## Workstreams
1. **AI Orchestration Intelligence** – knowledge graph, generative action translators, proactive insights.
2. **Autonomous Operations Fabric** – policy-driven autonomy, self-healing pipelines, cost-aware governance.
3. **Developer Experience Fabric** – golden paths, AI-assisted guidance, telemetry feedback loops.
4. **Program Governance** – architecture review board, risk register, measurement framework.

## Dependencies
- Knowledge graph package release (`ga-graphai/packages/knowledge-graph`).
- Guardrail gateway deployment in policy service.
- Observability DX metrics pipeline live.
- Enablement playbooks published for personas.

## Risk Register
| ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Knowledge graph schema drift across packages | High | Medium | Implement schema validation CI + versioned adapters. |
| R2 | AI action guardrails cause operational delays | Medium | Medium | Provide expedited approval paths + simulation results. |
| R3 | DX telemetry perceived as intrusive | Medium | Low | Transparent comms + opt-in pilot phases. |
| R4 | Cost guard data gaps reduce prediction accuracy | Medium | Medium | Backfill metrics via synthetic load tests and instrumentation. |

## OKRs
- **O1:** Reduce orchestration incident MTTR by 50% via predictive insights and autonomous remediation.
- **O2:** Achieve 80% adoption of persona golden paths with satisfaction score ≥ 4.2/5.
- **O3:** Deliver audit-complete AI operations with zero guardrail bypass events.

## Cadence & Reporting
- Weekly status sync with workstream leads; publish summary in `status/` directory.
- Monthly steering committee review; track decisions in `governance/adr/`.
- Metrics pipeline updates shared via Grafana dashboards referencing `observability/dx-metrics`.
