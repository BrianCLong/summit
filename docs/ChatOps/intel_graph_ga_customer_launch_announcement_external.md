## The Short Version
IntelGraph is now **GA**. It unifies graph analytics, entity resolution, and cross‑domain intelligence into a single, secure platform—designed for fast investigation, clear explainability, and enterprise‑grade operations.

---

## What’s New
- **Unified Graph AI Pipeline:** from feature generation to communities, anomalies, and explainability in one workflow
- **Entity Resolution Built‑In:** auto‑accept on high‑confidence pairs with human‑in‑the‑loop review queues
- **Predictive Insights:** link prediction with transparent model outputs and overlay to your graph store
- **Analyst Console:** responsive web UI with interactive network visualizations
- **Policy‑Aware by Design:** permissioning and data‑handling rules enforced across services
- **Export & Audit:** packaged evidence bundles with signed manifests for external review

---

## Why It Matters
- **Faster outcomes:** minutes from ingest to cross‑domain findings
- **Trustworthy analytics:** explainable outputs and auditability throughout
- **Operational reliability:** enterprise monitoring, SLOs, and disaster recovery in place

---

## Security & Compliance
IntelGraph ships with service‑to‑service encryption, role‑based and attribute‑based access controls, and hardened defaults. Compliance controls support common regulatory environments and produce artifacts for audit on request.
