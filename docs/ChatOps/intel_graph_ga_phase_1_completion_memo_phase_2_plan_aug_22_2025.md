_Date:_ **Aug 22, 2025**  
_Owner:_ **IntelGraph Program (GA Track)**  
_Distribution:_ Execs • Eng • Sec/Compliance • SRE • Product • Audit Readiness

## 1) Executive Summary

**GA Phase‑1 Enterprise Hardening is 100% complete.** We delivered 12/12 enterprise‑grade components with final security hardening and audit preparation validated. The platform is production‑ready with Zero‑Trust controls, comprehensive observability, CI/CD, automated compliance validation, and immutable provenance.

**Final Gate:** _Security Hardening & Audit Preparation Platform_ — integrated vulnerability assessment, compliance validation, and SIEM/IR workflows are live and green.

## 7) Residual Risks & Mitigations

- **Model/XAI drift exposure** → schedule robustness/fairness panels in Phase‑2; enable drift alerts.
- **Connector sprawl** → keep catalog curated; conformance tests mandatory; license/TOS enforcement at query‑time.
- **Offline sync conflicts** → continue CRDT merge audits; attach divergence reports to sync events.
- **Cost spikes** → activate cost guards (budget caps, slow‑query killer) early in Phase‑2.
