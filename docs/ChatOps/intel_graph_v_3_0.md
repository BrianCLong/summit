# IntelGraph v3.0.0‑GA — Release Notes, Status‑Page Announcement & GO‑LIVE NOW Runbook

**Release Version:** v3.0.0‑ga  
**Release Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Owner:** IntelGraph Program Team  
**Contact:** Stakeholder Management Team · incidents@intelgraph.example · #intelgraph-go-live

## A) Stakeholder‑Friendly Release Notes

### Highlights (TL;DR)
- **UNANIMOUS GO‑LIVE AUTHORIZATION** by the IntelGraph Advisory Council.
- **Performance:** 1.2M events/sec (sub‑8 ms), API p95 127 ms, Graph p95 1.2 s — all targets **exceeded**.
- **Security:** ABAC/OPA enforcing (default ON), authority binding at query time, immutable audit with cryptographic signing.
- **Resilience & DR:** Broker kill recovery in **1 m 47 s**; cross‑region DR **RTO 45 min / RPO 3 min**.
- **Cost Governance:** 31% under budget; real‑time caps; slow‑query killer; executive cost dashboard.
- **Visual Intelligence:** WebGL/WebGPU 3D graphs with AR/VR (WebXR), collaborative views.

### What’s New
- **Advanced ML Engine** — Multi‑modal intelligence processing (text, images, documents); ModelManager for lifecycle + load balancing.
- **Real‑Time Stream Processing** — Kafka/Pulsar/Redis Streams with adaptive backpressure, anomaly detection at ingest.
- **API Federation Gateway** — Apollo Federation, enterprise rate limiting, circuit breakers, distributed tracing.
- **Production Infra** — HA Postgres + Neo4j, Redis cache, Traefik TLS, full observability (Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger), automated backups.

### Why It Matters
- **Faster analysis** on larger graphs and streams.
- **Stronger guarantees** on security, auditability, and governance.
- **Operational confidence** via chaos‑tested failover and DR.
- **Lower total cost** with enforced budgets and real‑time visibility.

### SLOs (Public)
| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|---|---:|---:|
| API p95 latency | ≤ 150 ms | **127 ms** |
| Graph query p95 | ≤ 1.5 s | **1.2 s** |
| Stream throughput | ≥ 1.0M events/sec | **1.2M events/sec** |
| DR RTO | ≤ 60 min | **45 min** |
| DR RPO | ≤ 5 min | **3 min** |

### Security & Compliance
- **ABAC/OPA** enforcing (default ON) with policy attestations.
- **Authority Binding** at query time; immutable audit (Ed25519 signatures + hourly notarization).
- **SBOM & Secrets Hygiene**: continuous scanning; persisted queries required in production.

### Deprecations & Breaking Changes
- **Ad‑hoc GraphQL queries** are denied in production (persisted queries only).  
- Legacy **/v2 ingestion endpoints** are supported through **Q4 2025**; migrate to **/v3**.

### Upgrade / Adoption Guidance
1. Register persisted queries for production workloads.  
2. Verify tenant budgets and role‑based cost limits.  
3. Review authority‑binding scopes for sensitive fields.  
4. Migrate ingest to /v3 endpoints and enable anomaly‑detection flags.  
5. For AR/VR, ensure WebXR support or use 2D/3D fallback modes.

### Known Issues (Minor)
- Some browsers throttle WebXR in background tabs; visualization degrades gracefully to 2D/3D.
- First load of very large graphs may trigger a one‑time LOD cache build.

### Support
- **Status Page:** see announcement below  
- **Escalation:** follow incident matrix; 24×7 on‑call active

## B) Status‑Page Announcement (Customer‑Facing)

**Title:** IntelGraph v3.0.0‑GA — Production Go‑Live (Blue‑Green)

**Summary:** We are deploying IntelGraph v3.0.0‑GA using a blue‑green cutover. **No downtime is expected.**

**When:** T‑0 window begins **August 23, 2025** (local: America/Denver).  
**Impact:** Connections will transparently switch to the new environment. Brief increases in latency (seconds) may occur for a subset of requests.  
**What’s changing:** Performance, reliability, and security improvements; see Release Notes for details.  
**Rollback:** Prior version (v2.x) remains hot for 48 hours; one‑click route revert; Kafka replay (24h); DB PITR.

**Monitoring:** We are actively tracking SLOs (API latency, graph latency, broker lag, error rate).

**Thank you** for your partnership as we improve IntelGraph.

## C) GO‑LIVE NOW Runbook (One‑Pager — War Room)

### 1) Pre‑Flight (All Boxes Required)
- [ ] Release **v3.0.0‑ga** tag verified (GPG‑signed), artifacts checksummed (SHA256SUMS ✅).  
- [ ] **Persisted queries** published for all production tenants.  
- [ ] **Budgets/cost limits** confirmed per tenant/role; kill‑switches armed.  
- [ ] **Authority binding** policies loaded; audit signing keys rotated last ≤ 30 days.  
- [ ] **Backup checkpoint** taken; PITR markers set; DR restoration test within last 7 days.  
- [ ] **On‑call** rotations paged in; comms channels live; status‑page draft staged.  

### 2) Execute Blue‑Green Cutover (T‑0)
1. **Scale up GREEN** to target capacity; warm caches and LOD.  
2. **Health‑check GREEN**: /healthz, /readyz, synthetic GraphQL (read/write), stream ingest dry‑run.  
3. **Flip Traefik routes** 10% → 50% → 100% per SLO guardrails.  
4. **Enable enhanced tracing** for first 60 minutes.  
5. **Announce status‑page GO**; start 30‑minute update cadence.

### 3) Live Verification (T+0 → T+90m)
- [ ] API p95 ≤ 150 ms; error rate ≤ baseline+0.5%.  
- [ ] Graph p95 ≤ 1.5 s; hot path CPU ≤ 75%; GC time ≤ budget.  
- [ ] Broker lag ≤ 60 s, backlog drains < 10 min after peak.  
- [ ] DR hooks callable; audit signer logs clean; OPA decision logs normal.  
- [ ] Cost guardrails show budget adherence; no slow‑query kills on golden paths.

### 4) Rollback (Any Red Condition)
- [ ] **One‑click route revert** to BLUE.  
- [ ] **Disable producers**, drain consumers; **Kafka replay** scoped to affected partitions.  
- [ ] **PITR** restore if data writes at risk; hash validation before reopen.  
- [ ] Post‑rollback comms to status page + stakeholders.

### 5) T+1 Day Validation & Closeout
- [ ] All SLOs green for 24h; error budget burn within policy.  
- [ ] Release notes public; status page closed as **Completed**.  
- [ ] DR drill retrospective items ticketed; cost deltas reviewed.  
- [ ] Tag **v3.0.0‑ga‑post1** (if hotfixes applied) and archive war‑room logs.
