This new platform is trying to fix some of the weak spots of Maltego and Palantir. Here's the rundown:

**Maltego's Weaknesses (that this new platform fixes):**

* **Limited AI/ML:** Maltego isn't super strong on the AI front. This new platform is all about using advanced AI/ML to do cool stuff like predict links and understand documents.  
* **Performance Bottlenecks:** It can get bogged down, especially with big datasets, and isn't great at real-time data. The new platform aims for sub-second queries on huge datasets and real-time ingestion.  
* **Siloed Graphs:** Maltego's graphs can be a bit isolated. The new platform focuses on multi-domain data fusion and a unified knowledge base.

**Palantir's Weaknesses (that this new platform fixes):**

* **High Cost & Complexity:** Palantir can be really expensive and a pain to set up and get started with. The new platform wants to be "lighter-weight," have a lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and be easier to onboard.  
* **Closed Ecosystem:** Palantir is pretty locked down, making it hard to add your own stuff. This new platform is designed to be modular and extensible with an open API ecosystem and plugin system.  
* **Slower AI Innovation:** While Palantir uses AI, this new platform is pushing the boundaries with more advanced AI/ML integration, like generative AI and explainable AI.

The new intelligence platform will have these core capabilities:

* **Gobble up data:** It'll connect to all sorts of data sources like the web, databases, and even streaming stuff.  
* **Link things up:** It will create dynamic graphs to show how everything's connected, even the tricky bits.  
* **AI Power:** It'll use AI for things like finding anomalies, predicting stuff, and understanding documents.  
* **Lookin' good:** It'll make those graphs and data easy to see and interact with.  
* **Teamwork:** It will let multiple people work on investigations together, with notes and version control.  
* **Stayin' safe:** It will have top-notch security, privacy, and compliance built right in.  
* **Share the goods:** It will have easy reporting and export options.

For the developers, this platform is set to have some cool stuff:

* **Documents:** They'll get all the necessary papers, like requirements, API specs, diagrams (think flowcharts and how things relate), and security plans.  
* **Code samples:** There will be example plugins so they can build custom actions and visualizations.  
* **Deployment tools:** Files will be provided to help set up the platform on cloud services like Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform.  
* **Jira ready:** The project management will be structured for easy integration with Jira.

Okay, diving "Under the Hood" for the new intelligence platform, here's the techie stuff:

Plugin SDK Examples: (Starter code in Python/JS, documentation). 8\. Security & Compliance Policies: (Templates, doc files). If you specify your dev team's preferred stack, file formats, or workflow (e.g., GitHub/GitLab repo, Jira integration), I can generate and structure all files accordingly—including Markdown docs, YAML, SVG, Mermaid diagrams, starter code, and more. Would you like the complete bundle in a zipped folder, or links to each artifact in your preferred format? (Let me know your tech stack, repo structure, and any required output format to finalize the export.) You said: We are stack-agnostic. Defer to the best for the tasks. requirements in md. Generate full swagger spec. GitHub repo, Jira integration. I'd prefer both a zip file and links to each artifact. ChatGPT said: Excellent, here’s a full, actionable package plan. I’ll: Generate requirements in Markdown (.md) Produce a comprehensive OpenAPI (Swagger) 3.0 spec (.yaml) Provide a repo/file structure suitable for GitHub (with dev- and CI/CD-readiness) Document recommended Jira project/epic setup (with links to import templates) Provide all artifacts as downloadable files (zipped) and direct links for GitHub-ready usage. Note: While I can present all files and code here, I cannot directly upload files to GitHub/Jira or create a downloadable zip directly. However, I will present every artifact so you can copy-paste, and I can generate a manifest and a shell script to automate your own packaging if desired. 1\.
