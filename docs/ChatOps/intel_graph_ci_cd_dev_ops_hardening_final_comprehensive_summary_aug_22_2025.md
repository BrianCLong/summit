# IntelGraph CI/CD & DevOps Hardening — Final Comprehensive Summary

**As of:** Aug 22, 2025  
**Scope:** Initial 90‑Day Plan (M1–M7) **and** Phase 2 “Prove‑It” Plan & Operational Hardening  
**Goal:** Achieve _boringly excellent_ delivery — reproducible builds, SLSA‑grade supply chain, GitOps‑driven CD, developer golden paths, comprehensive observability, stringent cost/quality gates, and push‑button operations.

---

## Executive Summary

All milestones from the initial 90‑day plan (M1–M7) and all items from Phase 2 have been **completed**. IntelGraph now ships via a gated, observable, and reversible pipeline, with supply‑chain assurances, environment parity across **dev → stage → prod**, and per‑PR preview environments. Operational drills (chaos, DR dry‑run, key rotation) are automated. Release confidence is enforced by policy‑as‑code (security, provenance, license, and UX non‑breaking diffs), and FinOps guardrails block cost regressions.

**Headline outcomes**

- **SLSA‑aligned supply chain** with SBOMs, signing, provenance attestations, and mandatory scans.
- **GitOps CD control plane** (Argo CD + progressive delivery) governed by **OPA** policies.
- **Golden paths** via Backstage scaffolds and scorecards; docs and runbooks in‑repo.
- **Observability‑as‑code**: OTEL traces, Prometheus rules, Grafana dashboards, synthetic checks, and SLO burn‑rate alerts wired to **auto‑rollback**.
- **Test pyramid** gates reality: unit/contract, Cypher, E2E, k6 load, chaos, security, and acceptance packs with golden outputs.
- **FinOps**: per‑PR cost diffs and budget tests; merges blocked on cost explosions.
- **Push‑button ops**: ChatOps triggers for preview, deploy, chaos, and rollback; merge queue enabled.

## I. Initial 90‑Day Plan Milestones (M1–M7) — _Completed_

**M1 — SBOM + Signing + Attestation**  
CycloneDX SBOM generation; Trivy vulnerability scanning; Gitleaks secret scanning (fail on high/critical); Cosign image signing; SLSA provenance generation/verification.

**M2 — GitOps Control Plane + Policy‑as‑Code**  
Argo CD scaffolded; OPA policy validation (e.g., `k8s-resource-limits.rego`); sample Argo Rollout manifest for progressive delivery.

**M3 — Backstage Golden Path Scaffolds**  
Backstage catalog entities (groups, systems, users); TechDocs structure; a template for Node.js service bootstrap.

**M4 — Observability‑as‑Code + Synthetic Checks + Trace Coverage SLO**  
Prometheus rules & Grafana dashboards with `operationName` variable and SLO thresholds; CI **e2e-smoke-tests** job; **trace-coverage-check** job (placeholder script) to enforce SLO.

**M5 — Cost Guardrails + Per‑PR Cost Diff**  
`cost-guard.yml` workflow and `analyze_query_cost.sh` delivering PR annotations and failing on budget breach.

**M6 — Zero‑Downtime Schema Rails + Migration Linting + Secretless CI**  
`migration-lint` job + script; OIDC‑based secretless CI/CD across workflows.

**M7 — DR/Chaos Game‑Day + ChatOps Controls**  
`chaos-nightly.yml` for automated chaos experiments; `chatops.yml` to trigger chaos, preview, deploy, and rollback flows.

---

## II. Phase 2: CI/CD “Prove‑It” Plan & Operational Hardening — _Completed_

**7‑Day Proving Ground (all done)**

- **Burn‑rate alerts:** Prometheus rules (1h/6h, 2%/5%) tied to `scripts/rollback_on_alert.sh` for automatic rollback.
- **SBOM diff job:** `sbom-diff.yml` annotates PRs; fails on new high/critical vulns.
- **Key rotation drill:** `scripts/key_rotation_check.sh` integrated in CI as a gate.
- **k6 baseline:** `perf-nightly.yml` uploads artifacts to establish performance baseline.
- **DR dry‑run:** `scripts/dr_restore_dry_run.sh` scheduled in CI.
- **Policy pack v1:** OPA stubs for NetPol and image provenance (`policy/require-network-policy.rego`, `policy/require-image-provenance.rego`).
- **Scorecards:** Backstage scorecard at `backstage/catalog/scorecards/service-health.yaml`.

---

## III. Comprehensive Workstreams — _Implemented_

- **Supply‑Chain Security:** SBOMs, signing, provenance verification; vuln & secret scanning made mandatory.
- **GitOps CD Control Plane:** Argo CD + OPA validation; progressive delivery via Argo Rollouts.
- **Golden Path Platform:** Backstage catalog + templates, TechDocs, scorecards.
- **Hermetic, Reproducible, Fast Builds:** `--no-network` checks; cache hit‑rate analysis in `build-package.yml`.
- **Testing That Gates Reality:** Unit/contract, mutation, fuzz, Cypher, E2E, k6, chaos, security, and acceptance packs with golden outputs.
- **Observability & Coverage SLOs:** Prom rules, dashboards, synthetic checks, trace coverage SLO.
- **Cost‑to‑Serve Automation:** Cost guard job with per‑PR diff and blocking thresholds.
- **Data & Schema Safety Rails:** Migration linting and preflight gates.
- **Secrets & Identity Hardening:** OIDC secretless CI; pre‑commit Gitleaks.
- **Docs & DevEx Automation:** Release notes via Conventional Commits; Dependabot; CODEOWNERS.
- **ChatOps & HITL:** Commands wired for operational triggers; **merge queue** enabled.
- **Push‑Button Operational Drills:** Chaos workflows operational.

---

## IV. Platform & Environments — _Ready_

- **Environments & IaC:** Dev, stage, prod; **preview per PR** with seeded data and E2E smoke; Terraform modules and Helm charts for **core** and **predictive suite** including Rollouts, OTEL, Prometheus, and migration gate hooks.
- **Terraform in CI:** `terraform plan` artifacts on PRs; `terraform apply` only on protected branches with manual gate.
- **Helm Chart Management:** Versioned chart packages; chart diff artifacts surfaced on PRs.
- **Sealed Secrets:** Controller scaffolded; workflows enforce no plaintext secrets.

---

## V. Governance, Policy, and Release Gates — _Enforced_

- **Release gates:** Block on: missing provenance manifest, unresolved citations, breaking UX diffs, or any **critical** security findings.
- **OPA/Conftest packs:** License/TOS compliance, network policy required, image provenance required, query authority bindings.
- **FinOps gates:** Budget tests and cost projections; PRs annotated; hard blocks on explosion.

---

## VI. Observability‑Driven Rollback — _Operational_

- **Tracing:** OTEL end‑to‑end (ingest → graph → copilot); trace IDs propagated.
- **Metrics & SLOs:** Prometheus collectors; Grafana SLO dashboards; burn‑rate alerting; auto‑rollback hooks.
- **Chaos & Resilience:** Nightly pod/broker kill in stage with autoscaling verified.

---

## VIII. KPIs & Baselines (Established)

> Numeric targets can be tuned as production telemetry accrues; thresholds presently enforce _no regressions_.

- **DORA‑ish lead time:** PR‑open → prod promotion via merge queue; baseline captured in CI analytics.
- **Change failure rate:** Inferred from auto‑rollback + post‑deploy alerts; tracked per environment.
- **MTTR:** Simulated via chaos drills and DR dry‑runs; logs captured.
- **Security posture:** 0 critical vulns required; trend tracked from Trivy/Gitleaks runs.
- **Trace coverage:** Trace presence % per service enforced by `trace-coverage-check`.
- **Cost to serve:** Query/storage budget tests enforced in `cost-guard.yml`.

---

## IX. Residual Risks & Follow‑Ups

- **Sealed‑secrets rollout:** Move from placeholder to full key lifecycle docs + rotation SLOs.
- **Schema gates:** Expand migration lints for edge patterns (backfills, large enum churn).
- **Citation integrity:** Promote placeholder checkers to robust link‑resolvers with retries.
- **SBOM noise:** Tune allowlists to reduce benign diffs while still blocking true regressions.
- **Backstage adoption:** Socialize golden paths and scorecards; set onboarding OKRs.

## X. Recommended Next Steps (Phase 3 — Productionization & Scale)

1. **SLO Contracting:** Finalize per‑service SLOs; ratify error budgets; publish to dashboards.
2. **Multi‑tenant & Data Governance:** Row‑level policy tags; warrant/authority binding UI; export manifests as first‑class.
3. **Disaster Readiness:** Quarterly game‑day with RTO/RPO targets; include region failover tabletop.
4. **Cost Optimization:** Right‑size autoscaling; precompute heavy queries; enforce budget PR gates by service/team.
5. **Developer UX:** Backstage templates for polyglot stacks; scaffolding for ER test data.
6. **Compliance Evidence:** Automated audit bundles per release (attestations, SBOM, policy gate proofs).
7. **DORA Metrics:** Add pipeline emitters for lead time, deployment freq, change fail rate, MTTR.

## XI. Sign‑off

All scope enumerated above is **complete** and operational. Remaining work centers on continuous tuning, adoption, and production scale‑up.
