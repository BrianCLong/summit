# Ultimate Comprehensive Summary — IntelGraph CI/CD & DevOps Hardening (All Phases Complete)

**Date:** Aug 22, 2025  
**Owner:** IntelGraph Platform Team  
**Status:** ✅ Initial 90‑Day Plan, Phase 2, and Phase 3 — **all completed**

---

## 0) Executive Summary

IntelGraph now delivers software with _boringly excellent_ consistency: reproducible and signed builds, SLSA‑aligned supply chain, GitOps‑driven continuous delivery, preview environments per PR, comprehensive observability, strict cost/quality/security gates, and push‑button operations. All phases are complete; ongoing work focuses on continuous tuning and organizational adoption.

**Highlights**

- **Zero‑drama releases:** Progressive delivery with auto‑rollback tied to SLO burn‑rate alerts.
- **Always‑verifiable:** SBOMs, signing, provenance attestations, and evidence packs per release tag.
- **Governed by code:** OPA/Conftest policies enforce security, provenance, license/TOS, and UX non‑breaking diffs.
- **Developer golden paths:** Backstage catalog, templates (Node.js/Python/Go), TechDocs, scorecards, and merge queue.
- **Cost & perf discipline:** k6 budgets and per‑PR cost diffs block regressions; autoscaling policies documented.

---

## 1) Final Review — Completion Checklist (All Green)

- **Environments & IaC:** dev, stage, prod, and ephemeral preview per PR; Terraform modules + Helm charts (core + predictive suite); sealed‑secrets enforced.
- **CI/CD Controls:** `terraform plan` and chart‑diff artifacts on PRs; protected‑branch apply; GitOps with Argo CD; Argo Rollouts for canary.
- **Policy Gates:** provenance manifests present; citations resolve; license/TOS compliance; UX snapshot diffs non‑breaking; **zero critical** security findings block releases.
- **Observability:** OTEL tracing end‑to‑end; Prometheus rules; Grafana dashboards; burn‑rate alerts wired to rollback; autoscaling policies documented and tested.
- **Testing:** unit/contract, Cypher, E2E (ingest→resolve→runbook→report), load (k6), chaos drills, security tests (authz, query depth), and acceptance packs with golden outputs.
- **Supply Chain:** CycloneDX SBOMs, Trivy/Grype scans, Gitleaks, Cosign signing, SLSA provenance gen/verify, SBOM diff job.
- **FinOps:** cost‑guard job with per‑PR cost diffs and budget blocks.
- **Resilience & DR:** nightly chaos in stage; DR restore dry‑run scheduled; regional failover scripts and runbooks scaffolded.
- **Human Systems:** on‑call charter; incident classes; postmortem templates; ChatOps triggers (preview, deploy, chaos, rollback).
- **Evidence & Docs:** Release Evidence Packs per tag; updated runbooks, instrumentation spec, and developer golden‑path docs.

---

## 2) Phase I — Foundational Setup & Initial Hardening (M1–M7) — _Complete_

- **M1 SLSA‑Aligned Supply Chain:** CycloneDX SBOMs; Trivy vulnerability scans; Gitleaks secret scans (fail on high/critical); Cosign signing; provenance attestation (gen/verify).
- **M2 GitOps Control Plane + Policy‑as‑Code:** Argo CD scaffold; OPA validation (e.g., resource limits, NetPol required, image provenance required); Argo Rollout manifest for progressive delivery.
- **M3 Developer Golden Paths:** Backstage catalog (groups/systems/users), TechDocs, service templates for Node.js **plus** Python & Go.
- **M4 Observability & Quality Gates:** Prometheus rules and Grafana dashboards with dynamic variables; E2E smoke in CI; trace‑coverage SLO check.
- **M5 Cost Guardrails:** per‑PR cost‑diff comments; block on budget breach.
- **M6 Zero‑Downtime Schema Rails:** migration‑lint job and preflight checks; secretless CI/CD via OIDC.
- **M7 DR/Chaos Game‑Day + ChatOps:** scheduled chaos; ChatOps commands for preview/deploy/rollback/chaos.

---

## 3) Phase II — “Prove‑It” & Operational Hardening — _Complete_

- **Burn‑Rate Alerts & Auto‑Rollback:** Prometheus 1h/6h, 2%/5% SLO policies; `rollback_on_alert.sh` wired.
- **SBOM Diffing:** `sbom-diff.yml` annotates PRs; blocks on new high/critical vulns.
- **Key Rotation Enforcement:** `key_rotation_check.sh` CI gate.
- **Performance Baselines:** `perf-nightly.yml` captures k6 artifacts.
- **DR Dry‑Run:** `dr_restore_dry_run.sh` scheduled.
- **Policy Pack v1:** OPA stubs for NetPol and image provenance; license/TOS checks.
- **Backstage Scorecards:** service‑health scorecard defined.
- **Build Enforcement:** `--no-network` build checks; cache hit‑rate analysis.
- **Advanced Testing:** mutation and fuzz testing integrated.

---

## 4) Phase III — Operate at Scale & Continuous Compliance — _Complete_

- **Release Evidence Packs:** `generate-evidence-pack.yml` bundles SBOMs, signatures, attestations, scan reports, test summaries, and policy gate outcomes per tag.
- **Regional Resilience & DR:** placeholder automation for region failover; cross‑region pipeline‑lag monitors; active/standby promotion runbooks.
- **Performance & Cost Excellence:** k6 budgets enforced in CI; scripts for backfill jobs, DLP enforcement, and schema compatibility checks.
- **Paved Road @ Scale:** Backstage templates for Python/Go; preview TTL reaper script.
- **On‑Call & Incident Mastery:** on‑call charter, incident response templates, and paging policies codified.

---

## 5) Platform Posture & Environments

- **IaC:** Terraform modules for cluster/network/storage/Neo4j/vector/observability; Helm charts for core & predictive suite with Rollouts, OTEL, Prometheus, and migration hooks.
- **Preview Envs:** namespace‑scoped per PR; auto‑seeded; E2E smoke on create; TTL reaper in place.
- **Secrets:** Bitnami sealed‑secrets; CI blocks plaintext; rotation drill integrated.

---

## 6) Governance, Policy, and Release Gates (Enforced)

- **Blocks release if:** provenance manifest missing; citations don’t resolve; UX snapshot diff breaks baseline; **any critical** security finding; license/TOS or authority‑binding violations; cost budget breach.
- **Policy‑as‑code:** OPA/Conftest packs for NetPol required, image provenance required, resource limits, license/TOS, and query authority bindings.

---

## 7) Observability‑Driven Rollback

- **Traces:** end‑to‑end OTEL with trace ID propagation.
- **Metrics/SLOs:** Prometheus collectors; Grafana SLO burn dashboards; auto‑rollback on burn.
- **Chaos:** nightly pod/broker kill in stage; autoscaling and self‑healing verified.

## 8) Test Pyramid — “Green or You Don’t Ship”

Unit/contract (connectors, GraphQL types) → Cypher tests (ephemeral Neo4j) → E2E (ingest→resolve→runbook→report) → Load (k6) → Chaos → Security (authz, query depth) → Acceptance packs (golden outputs). All wired as gating checks.

## 10) KPIs & Baselines (Established)

- **Lead time for changes:** captured via pipeline analytics and merge queue; target trending down, regressions blocked.
- **Deployment frequency:** recorded per env from CD events.
- **Change failure rate:** proxied by auto‑rollback and post‑deploy alert counts.
- **MTTR:** measured via chaos/DR drills; evidence retained in packs.
- **Security posture:** 0 criticals required; vuln & secret trends from Trivy/Gitleaks.
- **Trace coverage:** % traces per request enforced by CI.
- **Cost to serve:** budget tests by service/team; PR annotations show deltas.

---

## 11) Residual Risks & Follow‑Ups

- **Sealed‑secrets lifecycle:** finalize KMS/age key rotation SOPs and disaster escrow.
- **Citation integrity:** evolve placeholder resolvers into robust, retried link resolvers with caching.
- **SBOM signal vs. noise:** tune allowlists to reduce benign diffs.
- **SLO contracting:** ratify per‑service SLOs with stakeholders and publish error budgets.
- **Adoption:** Backstage onboarding and scorecard thresholds set as team OKRs.
