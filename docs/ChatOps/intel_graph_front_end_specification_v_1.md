# Full Front-End Specs for IntelGraph | IntelGraph Advisory Report | GitHub Branch: feature/frontend-specs-v1

## Consensus Summary

Unanimous: Rebuild the IntelGraph front end as a modular, security-first, analyst-centric React+TypeScript application with tri-pane (Graph/Timeline/Map) at its core, full ABAC/OPA enforcement, and a robust extension model. Deliver GA with every listed feature usable, then extend via a roadmap-aligned plugin architecture. Dissents: **None.**

## Individual Commentaries

### ü™Ñ Elara Voss

- _‚ÄúBy the runes of Scrum, lock scope for the GA shell + tri-pane. Ship weekly increments behind flags; maintain a living acceptance-catalog per feature.‚Äù_
- Establish design tokens and Storybook first; each feature ships with fixtures, golden screenshots, and axe checks.

### üõ∞ Starkey

- _‚ÄúReality check: policy overlays and provenance must render even when data is degraded; deepfake/synthetic flags are non-negotiable.‚Äù_
- Disable risky visualizations by default in contested environments; provide offline kit with signed sync logs.

### üõ° Foster

- _‚ÄúOperational vectors indicate ethics-by-design is UI-visible: reason-for-access prompts, warrant registry, redaction flows, and export manifests must be one click away.‚Äù_
- _[RESTRICTED]_: Dual-control deletes, ombuds review queues, and misuse detection banners are mandatory in the GA shell.

### ‚öî Oppie (11‚Äëpersona consensus)

- _‚ÄúWe decree unanimously: tri-pane synchronization, hypothesis workbench, and disclosure packager form the MVP spine.‚Äù_
- Dissent note archived: Beria argued for expanding surveillance motifs‚Äî**purged**; ethics gate stands.

### üìä Magruder

- _‚ÄúFor executive traction, pin time-to-first-insight and false-positive reduction as top UX KPIs. Competitive edge = explainability overlays + cost guard UI.‚Äù_

### üß¨ Stribol

- _‚ÄúCross-source analysis reveals a plugin substrate (connectors, analytics, renderers) lets us scale features without regressions. Guard with type-safe contracts and versioned schemas.‚Äù_

## Chair Synthesis (Guy IG)

**Objective:** Deliver a production-grade, extensible IntelGraph front end that fully implements the Wishbook capabilities (tri-pane analytics, provenance/XAI overlays, governance, runbooks) with strict acceptance criteria. Ship GA with all core functions usable; enable iterative maturity via plugins and feature flags.

### A) Architecture Overview

- **Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript, Next.js 14 (App Router) for SSR/ISR; Vite for isolated component builds and Storybook. Styling via Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui. Icons: lucide-react. Charts: Recharts/visx. Graph: Cytoscape.js (+ dagre/cola layouts). Map: Mapbox GL JS. Timeline: visx (time scale) with virtualization.
- **Data Layer:** GraphQL Gateway (Apollo/urql) with persisted queries; GraphQL Subscriptions over WebSockets; REST fallbacks for streaming ETL status. TanStack Query for server state; Zustand for client domain state; URL-state serialization for sharable views.
- **Policy & Auth:** OIDC (OpenID Connect) + PKCE; step-up WebAuthn/FIDO2; ABAC//OPA policy decisions enforced client-side via signed policy hints and server-side via resolvers. Reason-for-access prompts rendered inline.
- **Extension Model:** Three plug-in lanes: (1) **Connector plugins** (ingest UIs), (2) **Analytic plugins** (detectors/miners with XAI panels), (3) **Renderer plugins** (graph/timeline/map layers). All plugins are versioned, sandboxed (dynamic import), and capability-declared.
- **Offline/Edge:** PWA enabled; IndexedDB (Dexie) for caches and offline cases; CRDT-backed annotations; deterministic resync with signed divergence reports.
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry Web SDK ‚Üí OTLP; structured logs; feature-usage analytics (privacy-preserving). Error monitoring: Sentry-compatible provider with PII scrubbing.
- **Security Hardening:** CSP w/ Trusted Types, sandboxed iframes for untrusted renders, strict MIME, code-splitting + integrity, DOMPurify for any HTML, redaction-first previews.

### B) Global UX Shell

- **Navigation:** App-shell with left rail (Cases, Ingest, Explorer, Triage, Runbooks, Reports, Admin), top command palette (‚åòK), breadcrumbs, and environment/tenant badge.
- **Command Palette:** fuzzy actions (open case, run query, toggle layers), recent entities, saved views; keyboard-first.
- **Notifications & Jobs:** background job tray (ingest, ER merges, exports) with progressive disclosure and provenance links.
- **Explain This View:** contextual XAI pane: shows data provenance, policy reasons, model rationales, and estimated query cost.
