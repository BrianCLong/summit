# IntelGraph Dominance Roadmap — Beat Every Competitor, Exceed Every Wish (2025–2027)

> Purpose: provide an end‑to‑end plan to win every category represented in the competitor matrix, fully mature our unique differentiators, shape emerging categories we can own, and exceed both the short and long wishlists.

---

## 0) Win Thesis (TL;DR)

**We win by** fusing a provenance‑first intelligence graph, explainable/agentic AI, and case‑centric workflows into a deployable platform that: (1) matches table‑stakes across the market, (2) opens blue‑ocean categories competitors don’t credibly cover, and (3) bakes governance + cost control into the product’s spine. Our durable moats are **Provenance & Claim Ledger**, **Graph‑XAI everywhere**, **Policy‑by‑Default**, **Edge/Offline kits**, **Federated multi‑graph**, and a **Runbook marketplace**.

**North‑Star metrics:** time‑to‑first‑insight ↓70%, hypothesis accuracy ↑, false‑positive rate ↓, disclosure cycle time ↓, SLO adherence ≥99.9%, and cost/insight ↓50%.

---

## 1) Competitive Landscape → What We Must Match (Table‑Stakes)

The competitor matrix shows near‑universal support for the following capabilities. These are **P0 parity bars** (we either already have them or must ship/announce by GA):

- Data Integration (164/164)
- Data Analysis (164/164)
- Threat Intelligence (163/164)
- Data Visualization (162/164)
- Threat Detection (162/164)
- Business Intelligence (155/164)
- Competitive Analysis (155/164)
- AI/ML Capabilities (152/164)
- Compliance (147/164)
- Predictive Analytics (147/164)
- Incident Response (146/164)
- Cybersecurity (146/164)
- AI/ML Workflows (146/164)
- Risk Management (145/164)
- Data Enrichment (144/164)

**Acceptance bar for parity** (per capability): public docs + demo + customer‑witnessed ref, with verifiable datasets and **Success Criteria**: (a) performs within SLOs, (b) provides provenance, (c) explains model‑assisted steps.

---

## 2) Blue‑Ocean & Differentiator Categories → What We Must Own

Low‑adoption capabilities in the matrix are **our category‑creation wedge**. We seize and name these categories, then dominate them with referenceable proofs:

- Cypher Query Language (1/164) → **NL→Cypher with preview & cost guard** + training.
- Index‑Free Adjacency (1/164) → **Graph at scale** story; benchmark + explainer.
- Insight Generation from Hidden Connections (1/164) → **Graph‑native XAI** panels.
- Retrieval‑Augmented Generation / GraphRAG (1–2/164) → **Evidence‑first RAG** with citations.
- Agentic AI (2/164) → **Runbook DAGs** with replayable logs and human‑in‑the‑loop.
- Data Federation (2/164) → **Federated multi‑graph search** with hashed deconfliction.
- Custom Crawling Profiles (2/164) → **Policy‑aware OSINT harvester** (licensed/consented only).
- Performance Optimization (1000× Faster Queries) (2/164) → **Hot/cold tiering + cache** roadmap.
- Enterprise‑grade Observability (OpenTelemetry, Full‑Stack) (2/164) → **/metrics + OTEL traces**.
- Unified TDIR (2/164) → **CTI + DFIR + fraud** runbooks unification.
- GenAI Applications (2/164) → **Narrative Builder** with inline citations and confidence bands.
- Flexible Schema Design (3/164) → **Schema registry + safe migrations**.
- Data License Registry (rare but critical) → **License/TOS enforcement** at query/export.

**Category creation playbook:** name → spec → demo → benchmarks → lighthouse design partners → analyst briefings → customer stories.

## 3) Our Durable Moats (Fully Matured)

1. **Provenance & Claim Ledger**: evidence registration, claim graphs, contradiction maps, verifiable exports.
2. **Graph‑XAI Everywhere**: paths/counterfactuals/saliency/fairness/robustness on every inference.
3. **Policy‑by‑Default**: ABAC/RBAC + OPA, warrant/authority binding, reason‑for‑access prompts, k‑anonymity/redaction.
4. **Edge/Offline Expedition Kits**: CRDT merges, signed sync logs, divergence reports; field‑ready war‑rooms.
5. **Federated Multi‑Graph**: cross‑tenant hashed deconfliction; minimal‑schema interop bridges.
6. **Runbook Marketplace**: first‑party + partner DAGs (CTI/DFIR/AML/HRD/crisis ops) with conformance tests.
7. **Cost Guard & FinOps**: budgets, slow‑query killer, hot/cold tiering, unit‑economics dashboards.
8. **Tri‑Pane Analyst UX**: synced graph/timeline/map, command palette, a11y AAA, undo/redo, “Explain this view.”

## 16) Wishbook Traceability Expansion

We parsed the Wishbook and generated a refined backlog mapping features → epics → stories. Highlights:

- **A. Data Intake & Preparation** — 12 items
- **B. Canonical Model & Graph Core** — 19 items
- **C. Analytics & Tradecraft** — 9 items

**Backlog export:** `/mnt/data/intelgraph_backlog_from_wishbook_refined.csv` (EPIC/STORY rows with squads and tags).

---

## 17) OKR Package & Tooling Wiring

I generated an OKR package you can import into most OKR tools (Viva Goals/Ally, Perdoo, WorkBoard, Gtmhub). Contents:

- `intelgraph_okrs_2025_2027.csv` — flat list of Objectives/KRs with owners, time period, data sources, tags.
- `intelgraph_okrs_2025_2027.json` — nested objectives → key results.

**Recommended conventions:**

- **Objective_ID:** `<Quarter><Year>-Ox` (e.g., Q42025-O2), unique across the portfolio.
- **KR_ID:** `<Objective_ID>-KRn`.
- **Tags:** use `GA`, `Parity`, `Federation`, `GraphRAG`, `Agents`, `Provenance`, `SLO`, `FinOps`, `Marketplace`.
- **Owners:** map squads to accountable leaders.

**Data wiring:**

- Perf metrics from **PerfBench** → latency, FPS.
- **Connector Registry** → live connector count.
- **RAG Audit** → citation validity.
- **Cost Guard Telemetry** → budget coverage & terminations.
- **Marketplace**/**LMS**/**Finance** → partner & revenue KRs.

**Import steps (generic):**

1. In your OKR tool, choose **Import → CSV/JSON**.
2. Map columns to fields: _Objective_Title, Owner, Time Period, KR_Description, Measure Type, Baseline, Target, Unit, Tags._
3. After import, set update frequency per KR (weekly/monthly) and assign data owners.
4. Connect dashboards to the listed data sources (or create manual update cadences).

---

## 18) Backlog & Jira/Asana Alignment

Use the refined backlog CSV to bulk‑create issues:

- **Epics:** each `Epic_Name` becomes an Epic in your tracker with Squad label.
- **Stories:** per bullet under each epic; acceptance criteria adopt the Wishbook’s acceptance patterns (see Section VII).
- Add links from Stories to **KR_IDs** they support to keep delivery↔outcomes traceability.
