# Phase 4 — Prototype Studio (Playbook + Templates)

**Mission of Phase 4 (Prototype):** Make ideas tangible—fast—so we can learn with real users and stakeholders. Favor multiple cheap experiments over one perfect build.

**Leads & Roles**

- **Prototype & Synthesis Leads:** Marc Newson, Dieter Rams, Naoto Fukasawa, Nick Bray
- **Facilitator:** (name)
- **Makers:** (names by workstream)
- **Documentarian:** (name)
- **ELO Ethics Liaison:** (name)

---

## Inputs → Outputs

**Inputs (from Phases 1–3):** POV statements, top HMWs, prioritized concepts, constraints (tech/legal/ops), initial success metrics.  
**Outputs (this phase):** A small **option set** of prototypes (lo‑fi → hi‑fi), experiment cards with hypotheses & measures, and a ready‑to‑run test plan for Phase 5.

---

## Guardrails

- **Ethics Gate (ELO):** All prototypes must pass a quick **Legitimacy & Risk check** (consented data, safety, privacy‑by‑design).
- **Provenance:** Every artifact carries **version, author, date, and assumptions**.
- **Time & Money:** Default to **time‑boxed, low‑cost** materials.

---

## Timeboxes (pick one)

**⚡ ½‑Day Blitz (3.5h total)**

1. Option sketching (30m)
2. Converge & storyboard (20m)
3. Build lo‑fi prototypes (100m)
4. Prep test scripts & measures (30m)
5. Dry‑run & logistics (30m)

**🔧 2‑Day Studio**

- Day 1 AM: Option sketches → vote → **Option Set** (3–5)
- Day 1 PM: Build lo‑fi, instrument for testing
- Day 2 AM: Iterate to mid‑fi; align measurement
- Day 2 PM: Pilot with 1–2 users; refine scripts & consent

---

## Prototype Ladders

Progress only as fidelity is justified by risk.

- **Lo‑fi (hours):** paper, click‑throughs, Wizard‑of‑Oz, role‑play, storyboard video.
- **Mid‑fi (days):** interactive Figma, Framer mock, spreadsheet models, service blueprint.
- **Hi‑fi (weeks):** coded spike, functional rig, data‑backed simulation.

**Tip:** Build **3 distinct options** that explore different trade‑offs (e.g., simplicity vs. power; automation vs. control; privacy vs. personalization).

## Option Set Canvas

Use this for side‑by‑side comparison.

- **Option A — “Minimal Path”**
  - Key promise:
  - Critical assumption(s):
  - Prototype type & scope:
  - Risks addressed:
- **Option B — “Assistive Copilot”**
  - Key promise:
  - Critical assumption(s):
  - Prototype type & scope:
  - Risks addressed:
- **Option C — “Power User”**
  - Key promise:
  - Critical assumption(s):
  - Prototype type & scope:
  - Risks addressed:

## Experiment Card (Template)

- **Name:**
- **Hypothesis:** _We believe that_ **_ *for* _** _will result in_ **_ *because* _**.
- **User segment / context:**
- **Prototype version:** ID, date, owner
- **What to measure (top 3):**
  1. Task completion (define)
  2. Time on key step / decision latency
  3. Confidence / trust (Likert or confidence band)
- **Success criteria:** (quant + qual thresholds)
- **Ethics & privacy checks:** consent, data minimization, debrief plan
- **Run script (bullet steps):**
- **Debrief prompts:** surprises, breakdowns, delight, workarounds
- **Decision rule:** _If X and Y met, proceed to \_\_; else pivot/kill._

---

## Measures & Instruments

- **Behavioral:** completion %, error/rework count, abandonment points, path choices
- **Cognitive:** confidence rating, mental model alignment (card sort / concept test)
- **Affective:** trust / perceived control / perceived risk
- **Operational:** setup time, support touches, training required

**Recording kit:** screen + audio (if consented), timestamped notes, heat‑map or path logs, “think‑aloud” excerpts.

---

## Definition of Ready / Done

**Ready to Prototype**

- [ ] Named user segment(s) & scenarios
- [ ] 1–2 focused hypotheses per concept
- [ ] Success metrics & thresholds agreed
- [ ] Ethics check cleared (ELO)

**Done with Phase 4**

- [ ] 3–5 instrumented prototypes
- [ ] Experiment cards filled & scheduled
- [ ] Test scripts prepared with recruiting list
- [ ] Risks & open questions logged

## Materials & Tools (suggested)

- Paper, markers, sticky notes; storyboards; index cards
- Figma / FigJam, Framer, Mural; Google Sheets for quick models
- Screen‑recording + consent forms; timer; observation sheets

---

## Observation Sheet (1‑pager)

- Participant code:
- Scenario:
- Notable behaviors (timestamps):
- Quotes (verbatim):
- Frictions / breakdowns:
- Workarounds observed:
- Moments of delight:
- Facilitator notes:

---

## Ethics & Legitimacy Checklist (ELO)

- [ ] Clear purpose; lawful & consented data
- [ ] Minimal necessary personal data; redaction where possible
- [ ] Debrief & right‑to‑withdraw communicated
- [ ] Risk to vulnerable users considered; mitigation documented

---

## Handoff to Phase 5 (Test & Iterate)

When the option set is built and instrumented, confirm:

- Recruiting list & schedule set
- Scripts, tasks, and consent ready
- Data capture & storage plan verified
- Decision‑making cadence agreed (what gets iterated vs. retired)

> **Reminder:** Build to learn, not to ship. Keep it light, legible, and testable.
