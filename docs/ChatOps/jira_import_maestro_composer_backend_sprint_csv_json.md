## JSON (Jira Cloud REST Bulk Create)
> Optional: POST to `/rest/api/3/issue/bulk` (auth required). Replace `PROJECT_KEY`. Epic links require created epic keys; create epics first, then stories referencing those keys, or run two passes.

```json
{
  "issueUpdates": [
    {"fields": {"project": {"key": "MCB"}, "summary": "EPIC A — Definitions & Versioning", "issuetype": {"name": "Epic"}, "customfield_10011": "EPIC A — Definitions & Versioning", "components": [{"name": "workflow-engine"}], "labels": ["composer","backend","epic"], "fixVersions": [{"name": "maestro-composer-backend-v0.1"}]}},
    {"fields": {"project": {"key": "MCB"}, "summary": "EPIC B — Execution Runtime", "issuetype": {"name": "Epic"}, "customfield_10011": "EPIC B — Execution Runtime", "components": [{"name": "workflow-engine"}], "labels": ["runtime","backend","epic"], "fixVersions": [{"name": "maestro-composer-backend-v0.1"}]}}
    
    /* Create remaining epics C–F, then stories linking via "epic link" custom field (varies by site; in company-managed projects often customfield_10014). */
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Your site’s Epic Name field and Epic Link field IDs (e.g., `customfield_10011`, `customfield_10014`) will differ. Check **Jira Settings → Issues → Custom fields**.

## Repo‑Aware Notes (for implementers)
- **Workflow Engine code:** `/apps/workflow-engine/src/server.ts`, `/apps/workflow-engine/src/services/WorkflowService.ts`, `/apps/workflow-engine/src/services/WorkflowBuilder.ts`.
- **Migrations present:** `/server/src/db/migrations/014_workflow_automation_tables.sql` defines `workflow_definitions`, `workflow_executions`, `human_tasks`, `workflow_templates`, etc.
- **GraphQL federation placeholder:** `/server/graphql/federation/index.ts` → fill with read resolvers.
- **Provenance service:** `/prov-ledger-service/src/server.ts`, `/prov-ledger-service/src/ledger.ts` with signing helpers.
- **QoS config:** `/router/qos.yaml` — use for backpressure & budgets.
- **Observability:** add OTEL + Prom metrics in `apps/workflow-engine/src/server.ts` and worker loop.

## After Import — Quick Setup
1) Move all stories into sprint **Sep 2–Sep 13, 2025**.  
2) Assign owners.  
3) Create dashboards: *Sprint burndown*, *Runtime RED*, *Policy decision rate*.  
4) Link stories to runbooks in `RUNBOOKS/` and ADRs.
