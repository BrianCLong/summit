# 📜 Council Feature & Use‑Case Wishbook — Final Product

_Compiled under the Chairmanship of Markus Wolf. Purpose: enumerate desired **features**, **functions**, and **use cases** for IntelGraph’s final product, across all Council seats and trusted contacts. Ethical guardrails apply by default; requests that would enable unlawful harm are **declined** and redirected to compliant, defensive alternatives._

---

## I) Executive Summary

IntelGraph’s end‑state is a **secure, multi‑tenant intelligence graph platform** with first‑class **provenance**, **compartmentation**, **automated tradecraft**, and **oversight by design**. It serves investigative analysis, counterintelligence, cyber defense, crisis operations, and policy decision support. The Council’s asks converge on: (1) rich ingestion + entity resolution; (2) temporal/geo graph analytics; (3) hypothesis & deception tooling; (4) AI copilot with citations; (5) ironclad governance.

---

## II) Prioritization Principles (Consensus)

- **Mission first, ethics always**: safety rails, auditability, consented/authorized data only.
- **Provenance > prediction**: every assertion has source, confidence, and chain‑of‑custody.
- **Compartmentation**: project/tenant isolation, ABAC/RBAC, two‑person controls for sensitive ops.
- **Interoperability**: STIX/TAXII, MISP, JSON‑LD, GraphQL, OpenTelemetry, OpenID Connect.
- **Operate disconnected**: degraded/offline modes; cryptographic sync on reconnect.

## III) Master Backlog Matrix (Features → Functions → Use Cases)

### A. Data Intake & Preparation

- **Connectors catalog** (HTTP, S3, GCS, Azure Blob, Kafka, Kinesis, AMQP, email, Git, RSS, STIX/TAXII, MISP, Sigma rules, CSV/Parquet, PCAP metadata, NetFlow/IPFIX, DNS/WHOIS, Shodan‑like datasets, public sanctions lists).
  - _Use cases:_ bulk OSINT pull; ingest CTI feeds; import agency case exports; pull doc sets for discovery.
- **Ingest wizard** with schema mapping, PII classification, DPIA checklist, and redaction presets.
  - _Use cases:_ paralegal loads discovery; analyst maps CSV to canonical entities in minutes.
