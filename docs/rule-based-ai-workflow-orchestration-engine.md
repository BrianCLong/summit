# Rule-Based and AI-Augmented Workflow Orchestration Engine

## Overview

An orchestration layer that combines deterministic rules with AI-driven actions to automatically generate intelligence reports, briefs, and warnings. The engine sequences data collection, enrichment, analysis, and publishing tasks while allowing analysts to intervene at critical checkpoints.

## Core Components

- **Rule Engine**
  - Declarative YAML/JSON definitions for task sequences
  - Conditional branching, retries, and escalation paths
  - Integration with existing graph, NLP, and enrichment services
- **AI Augmentation**
  - LLM-powered summarization and insight generation
  - Pattern recognition and anomaly detection modules
  - Confidence scoring with explainability hooks
- **Workflow Runtime**
  - Event-driven microservice that schedules and executes tasks
  - Tracks inputs, outputs, and execution metadata for each step
  - Supports pluggable connectors for external data sources and messaging

## Analyst-in-the-Loop Review

- Configurable approval gates before report release
- UI surface for editing AI-generated content and annotating sources
- Feedback loop feeds into rule tuning and model retraining

## Traceability & Classification

- Step-level provenance with timestamps, actors, and data lineage
- Mandatory classification tags (e.g., TLP, caveats) attached to all artifacts
- Versioned report history to audit changes over time

## Compliance Logging

- Signed, immutable logs streamed to centralized audit store
- Policy checks enforced at workflow runtime (e.g., need-to-know, retention)
- Exportable compliance reports for regulators and internal review

## Future Enhancements

- Adaptive rule learning based on analyst feedback
- Automated redaction for downgraded classification levels
- Cross-domain workflow federation for joint task forces
