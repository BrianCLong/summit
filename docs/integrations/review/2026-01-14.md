# Integrations & Partner Reliability Review - 2026-01-14

## 1. Integration Ground Truth Snapshot

| Integration | Tier | Status | Failure Modes | Contract Notes | Test Coverage | Runbook |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Elasticsearch** | 0 | 🟢 Green | None recent | v1.0.0 (Stable) | High (Mocked + Contract) | ✅ |
| **Chronicle (Google)** | 0 | 🟡 Yellow | SOAR trigger latency | v1.0.0; Playbook triggers "in-review" | Medium (Unit ok, E2E gaps) | ✅ |
| **Splunk** | 1 | 🟢 Green | Occasional timeout on large queries | v1.0.0 (Stable) | High | ✅ |
| **DuckDB** | 1 | 🟡 Yellow | Memory spikes on large aggregations | v1.0.0; Resource guards "in-review" | High (Unit) | ✅ |
| **RSS News** | 2 | 🟡 Yellow | Content safety false positives | v1.0.0; Safety filters "in-review" | Medium | ⚠️ Draft |
| **ESRI ArcGIS** | 1 | 🟡 Yellow | Projection errors on edge cases | v1.0.0; CRS coverage "in-review" | Medium | ✅ |
| **Sentinel** | 1 | 🟢 Green | None recent | v1.0.0 (Stable) | High | ✅ |
| **S3 CSV** | 1 | 🟢 Green | None recent | v1.0.0 (Stable) | High | ✅ |

**Inventory Note:** 13 Active Connectors. 5 with "certified" badges pending in one or more categories.

## 2. Objectives

1.  **Stabilize Tier 0 Chronicle Integration:** Complete the "SOAR playbook triggers" certification by implementing deterministic playback tests for alert triggers.
2.  **Enforce Resource Limits on DuckDB:** Implement and verify memory/CPU guardrails for the DuckDB connector to prevent container OOMs during large analytical queries.
3.  **Harden Geospatial Projections (ESRI):** Expand test matrix to cover edge-case Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and ensure graceful degradation.

## 3. Execution Plan

| Task ID | Prio | Agent | Integration | Failure Mode | Verification | Expected Output |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `INTEG-20260114-01` | P0 | Codex CLI | Chronicle | SOAR Trigger Reliability | `pnpm verify --filter=chronicle-soar` | Deterministic trigger simulation tests; Certification badge update. |
| `INTEG-20260114-02` | P0 | Antigravity | DuckDB | Resource Exhaustion (OOM) | `scripts/verify-resource-limits.ts` | Configured memory limits in connector; Validation script. |
| `INTEG-20260114-03` | P1 | Codex CLI | ESRI | Schema/Projection Error | New Jest cases in `connectors/esri_connector` | Expanded CRS test matrix; 100% pass on projection edge cases. |
| `INTEG-20260114-04` | P2 | Claude Code | RSS News | Content Safety Noise | `pnpm test:integration` | Tuned filter thresholds; Updated `pii-denylist.txt` if needed. |

## 4. Decisions & Rationale

*   **DuckDB Priority:** Elevated to P0 due to risk of destabilizing the shared worker pool with unconstrained analytical queries.
*   **Chronicle Focus:** Focus is on *output* (SOAR triggers) rather than ingestion, as ingestion is stable. This closes the certification gap.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Continuing strict "no live network" policy. All external API behaviors for ESRI and Chronicle must be mocked using recorded fixtures or deterministic simulators.

## 5. Cross-System Actions

*   [ ] **GitHub Projects:** Move DuckDB card to "In Progress"; link `INTEG-20260114-02`.
*   [ ] **Linear:** Create issue for Chronicle SOAR tests (linked to `INTEG-20260114-01`).
*   [ ] **Notion:** Update `docs/connectors/duckdb.md` with new resource limit configuration params.
*   [ ] **Jira:** Update ESRI ticket status to "In Review" once tests are added.
