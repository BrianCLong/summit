# Regulated Baselines

This document maps regulatory requirements to controls, evidence, and owners for the Summit platform. Its purpose is to provide a single source of truth for our compliance posture against key government and regulated market standards.

## Target Regimes

- **FedRAMP High**: A U.S. government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.
- **ICD 503**: The Intelligence Community Directive that establishes policy for the protection of intelligence and intelligence sources, methods, and activities.
