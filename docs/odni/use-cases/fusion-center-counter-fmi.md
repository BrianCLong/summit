# Use Case: Fusion Centers - Countering Foreign Malign Influence (FMI)

## Mission Context
The Foreign Malign Influence Center (FMIC) and other fusion bodies must detect, understand, and counter coordinated information warfare campaigns designed to destabilize democratic institutions.

## Challenge
*   **Cross-Platform Coordination:** Adversaries operate simultaneously across Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, and fringe news sites.
*   **Narrative Velocity:** Disinformation spreads faster than truth; manual debunking is too slow.
*   **Attribution Difficulty:** Differentiating between organic viral content and coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) is difficult.

## Summit Solution: Cognitive Influence Surface Mapping

Summit maps the "information terrain," treating narratives as viruses and social networks as transmission vectors.

### Key Capabilities Applied
1.  **Cross-Platform Ingestion:** Unified view of discourse across mainstream and fringe platforms.
2.  **Narrative Clustering:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) groups millions of posts into distinct "narrative themes" (e.g., "Election Fraud", "Health Scare").
3.  **Bot Detection:** Algorithms detect coordinated timing and semantic similarity to identify botnets and troll farms.
4.  **PsyOps Simulation:** The "Narrative Simulation Engine" predicts how a counter-narrative would spread through the mapped network.

## Operational Workflow

1.  **Detection:** The "Anomaly Detector" flags a sudden spike in negative sentiment regarding a specific policy topic on 4chan and Telegram.
2.  **Origin Tracing:** The analyst uses the Network Graph to trace the narrative back to its "Patient Zero"—a known state-sponsored proxy account.
3.  **Amplification Analysis:** Summit visualizes how the narrative hopped from fringe sites to mainstream media, highlighting key "super-spreader" nodes.
4.  **Response Modeling:** The analyst simulates three potential response options (Ignore, Debunk, Pre-bunk). The simulation predicts that "Pre-bunking" has the highest probability of containment.
5.  **Executive Briefing:** A "Flash Report" is generated, visualizing the campaign's reach and attribution confidence for policymakers.

## Impact
*   **Early Warning:** Detects campaigns in the "seeding" phase before they go viral.
*   **Precision Response:** Targets interventions where they will have the most effect (e.g., de-platforming a specific node vs. general broadside).
*   **Democratic Resilience:** Protects public discourse from weaponized inauthenticity.
