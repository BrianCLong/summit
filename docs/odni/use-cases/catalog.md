# IC Mission Use Case Catalog

This catalog enumerates specific mission scenarios supported by the Summit platform, mapped to IC agencies and functional domains.

## Central Intelligence Agency (HUMINT)
1.  **Asset Validation (Digital Triplet):** Correlating asset claims with commercial data exhaust to verify backstories.
2.  **Cover Status Monitoring:** Detecting potential compromises of cover identities via automated breach data monitoring.
3.  **Source Reliability Scoring:** Automated cross-referencing of source reporting against proven ground truth.
4.  **Counter-Surveillance Route Planning:** Analyzing pattern-of-life data to suggest safe meeting routes/times.
5.  **Meeting vulnerability Analysis:** Identifying risks associated with proposed meeting locations based on recent diverse sensor activity.

## National Security Agency (SIGINT/Cyber)
6.  **C2 Infrastructure Chaining:** Mapping adversary command-and-control networks via passive DNS and WHOIS pivots.
7.  **Cyber Attribution:** Linking technical indicators (IPs, hashes) to physical personas and organizations.
8.  **Vulnerability Impact Assessment:** Graph-based querying to identify all high-value targets running a specific vulnerable software version.
9.  **Crypto-Key Relationship Mapping:** Tracking the proliferation and reuse of SSL/TLS certificates by threat actors.
10. **Signal Anomaly Detection:** Identifying new/unusual signal emitters in specific geographic areas of interest.

## National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (GEOINT)
11. **Pattern of Life Analysis:** Establishing baseline activity levels for facilities to detect operational surges.
12. **Illicit Shipping Interdiction:** Detecting ship-to-ship transfers and AIS "dark" periods indicative of sanctions evasion.
13. **Facility Change Detection:** Automated alerts for new construction or equipment arrival at monitored sites.
14. **Disaster Damage Assessment:** Rapidly fusing social media reports with satellite imagery to map impact zones.
15. **Supply Chain Logistics Mapping:** Tracing the physical flow of dual-use goods from manufacturer to end-user.

## Defense Intelligence Agency (Defense/Military)
16. **Dynamic Order of Battle:** Real-time updating of military unit hierarchies and equipment holdings.
17. **I&W (Indications & Warning):** Detecting mobilization indicators (e.g., blood bank movements, rail car loading).
18. **Technological Surprise Prevention:** Monitoring scientific literature and patent filings for breakthroughs in adversary capabilities.
19. **Logistics Vulnerability Analysis:** Identifying single points of failure in adversary supply lines.
20. **Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) Fusion:** Correlating kinetic strikes with OSINT/SIGINT to verify effects.

## Treasury / FBI / DHS (Financial & Law Enforcement)
21. **Sanctions Evasion Networks:** Unraveling complex shell company structures used to hide beneficial ownership.
22. **Cryptocurrency Tracing:** Tracking illicit funds across blockchains and mixing services to off-ramps.
23. **Counter-Terrorism Finance (CTF):** Mapping donation networks between charities and extremist groups.
24. **Insider Threat Detection:** Correlating employee network activity with financial stress indicators (if legally authorized).
25. **Transnational Organized Crime:** Mapping cartel command structures and trafficking routes.

## Foreign Malign Influence Center (Information Warfare)
26. **Botnet Detection:** Identifying coordinated inauthentic behavior across social platforms.
27. **Narrative Propagation Analysis:** Tracing the spread of disinformation from fringe sites to mainstream media.
28. **Synthetic Media Detection:** Flagging deepfakes and AI-generated text in the information environment.
