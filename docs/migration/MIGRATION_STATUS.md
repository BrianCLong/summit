## Next Steps

1. Run triage script to label remaining PRs:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/maintainers/triage-unrelated-history-prs.sh --apply
   ```

2. Authors should recreate PRs following the [PR Recreation Playbook](./PR_RECREATION_PLAYBOOK.md)

3. When a recreated PR includes "Supersedes #<old>", run:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/maintainers/migration-supersedes.sh --apply
   ```
