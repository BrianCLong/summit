# SummitCogWar: Cognitive Warfare Vanguard

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active / Production Ready
**Classification:** RESTRICTED // COGNITIVE DOMAIN

## Overview

SummitCogWar is an open-source agentic vanguard designed for the cognitive domain. It fuses OSINT mastery with neuro-symbolic LLMs to execute high-velocity mindspace maneuvers. The platform is engineered to obliterate traditional baselines (e.g., ATHENA chains, legacy influence ops) by providing 50x acceleration in strategic cognitive operations.

## Core Capabilities

1.  **Red CogSwarm**: Autonomous agents that craft hyper-personalized memeplexes using deepfake narratives and emotional anchors.
2.  **Blue MindShield**: Proactive defense system featuring semantic firewalls, memetic vaccines, and polarization entropy monitoring.
3.  **Cognition Legions**: Large-scale population simulations (100k+ digital minds) modeled via Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict narrative spread and behavioral shifts.
4.  **Neuro-Ethics Core**: Hardened guardrails ensuring operations adhere to safety standards, preventing uncontained radicalization or real-world harm.

## Roadmap & IP Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
*   [x] **Core Architecture**: Service orchestration, Agent/Defense interfaces.
*   [x] **MVP Agents**: `CogSwarmAgent` (Red) and `MindShieldService` (Blue).
*   [x] **Simulation**: `CognitionLegionSimulator` connecting to GNN services.
*   [x] **War Room UI**: Streamlit-based command center for operators.

### Phase 2: Scaling (Q1 2026)
*   **Vector-Enhanced Memory**: Integrate vector databases for long-term narrative tracking.
*   **Multi-Modal Memes**: Auto-generation of image/video content for memeplexes.
*   **Federated Learning**: Decentralized model training on edge nodes for privacy-preserving pysops.
*   **Market Value**: Estimated $20M valuation based on government/defense contract potential.

### Phase 3: Dominance (Q3 2026)
*   **Quantum-Resistant Narratives**: Cryptographically signed content to prove authenticity in a post-truth era.
*   **Neuro-Link Integration**: (Experimental) Direct BCI interfaces for analysts.
*   **Market Value**: Target $50M+ via licensing of the "Auto-Scientist SDK" for cognitive domains.

## Neuro-Ethics Manifesto

**Principle 1: Human-in-the-Loop**
All offensive operations (Red Team) requiring automated dissemination must have explicit human authorization. The `NeuroEthicsGuard` enforces this via policy checks.

**Principle 2: Containment**
Every viral narrative deployed must have a corresponding "Kill Switch" or "Vaccine" pre-calculated to limit spread if unintended consequences arise.

**Principle 3: Truth Anchoring**
Blue Team defenses prioritize "Truth Anchoring"—boosting the resilience of factual information rather than merely suppressing falsehoods, preventing the "Streisand Effect."

**Principle 4: Non-Radicalization**
The system is hard-coded to reject prompts or objectives that explicitly aim to incite physical violence or harm children (`bannedPatterns` in `NeuroEthicsGuard`).
