# Privacy Terminology (Telemetry)

## Deterministic pseudonymization

Summit uses **deterministic pseudonymization** for stable, domain-scoped tokens.
These tokens reduce exposure but remain personal data when attribution is
reasonably possible, so they must never be marketed or treated as anonymous by
default.

## Anonymization

Summit may only describe data as anonymized when attribution is not reasonably
possible given available information and documented safeguards. Any anonymization
claim must be supported by explicit evidence artifacts and a DPIA record.
