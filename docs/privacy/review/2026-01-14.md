# Privacy, Data Retention, and Deletion Lifecycle Review - 2026-01-14

## 1. Privacy Ground Truth Snapshot

*   **Inventory:**
    *   **Classes:** PII (High), Biometric (Critical), Tenant Data (Medium), Logs (Low), Evidence (Medium).
    *   **Locations:** Postgres (Identity), Neo4j (Graph), S3 (Backups), Elasticsearch (Logs).
*   **Policies (`COMPLIANCE.md`):**
    *   Border Crossing: 90 Days (Retention)
    *   Watchlist Hit: 10 Years
    *   No Match: 7 Days
    *   **Status:** Defined but partially manual enforcement.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   **Retention Automation:** "Border Crossing" (90 days) policy relies on manual purge scripts or ad-hoc jobs. Needs deterministic TTL or Cron.
    *   **RSS News Feed:** New connector ingests public data that may contain PII. `pii-denylist.txt` needs updating.
    *   **Documentation:** `COMPLIANCE.md` "Last Updated" is Nov 2025. Needs verification refresh.

## 2. Objectives

1.  **Automate 90-Day Retention:** Implement a Postgres partitioning or scheduled job strategy to automatically delete "Border Crossing" biometric records older than 90 days.
2.  **Harden OSINT Privacy:** Update `pii-denylist.txt` and `RedactionMiddleware` to handle unstructured text from the new `rss-news` connector.
3.  **Verify Deletion Proof:** Implement a "Deletion Proof" generator that creates a cryptographic stamp when a `Subject` is deleted, satisfying the "Right to Erasure" audit requirement.

## 3. Execution Plan

| Task ID | Prio | Agent | Data Class | Mechanism | Verification | Expected Output |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `PRIV-20260114-01` | P0 | Codex CLI | Biometric (Border) | Database (PgCron/Partition) | `tests/privacy/retention.test.ts` | Automated deletion logic; Test confirming 91-day-old data is gone. |
| `PRIV-20260114-02` | P1 | Antigravity | OSINT (News) | Configuration (`pii-denylist`) | `scripts/verify-pii-redaction.ts` | Updated denylist; Redaction verified on news feed sample. |
| `PRIV-20260114-03` | P1 | Codex CLI | PII (Subject) | Code (Proof Generator) | `tests/privacy/deletion_proof.test.ts` | JSON artifact generated on deletion with signature. |
| `PRIV-20260114-04` | P2 | Claude Code | Docs | Policy | Review | Updated `COMPLIANCE.md` with new automation details. |

## 4. Decisions & Rationale

*   **Automation over Manual:** Moving retention from "policy" to "code" (P0) reduces compliance risk significantly.
*   **Proof of Deletion:** As we move towards GA, having an audit artifact for deletions is critical for GDPR compliance.
*   **OSINT Risk:** Public news feeds are a "hidden" source of PII; applying the standard redaction middleware is a proactive safety measure.

## 5. Cross-System Actions

*   [ ] **GitHub Projects:** Add "Retention Automation" to Privacy lane.
*   [ ] **Linear:** Create P0 task for Retention Implementation (`PRIV-20260114-01`).
*   [ ] **Jira:** Log "Deletion Proof" feature request for the Compliance Team.
*   [ ] **Notion:** Update `DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAMS.md` to show the new Deletion Proof artifact flow.
