# Differential Privacy SLA

Services enforce privacy budgets using epsilon caps, k-anonymity and error bounds. Each query is checked against expected variance. When observed error exceeds the bound, the entitlement is paused and a credit or refund is issued automatically.

Refunds and pauses are logged for auditing and exposed in the marketplace dashboard.
