# Switchboard Positioning (Consumer → White-Label → Enterprise Bridge)

## Purpose

Switchboard is the governed personal agent wedge that converts consumer trust into enterprise adoption. It ships one governed core with three shells and a single evidence chain. The wedge is revenue-first, evidence-first, and policy-first.

## Market Entry Thesis

- **Hype moment, trust gap**: The personal agent market is expanding fast, but security and governance failures are public. Switchboard wins by making governance visible and provable.
- **Wedge to enterprise**: Consumer traction creates proof artifacts (receipts, audits, determinism) that shorten enterprise sales cycles.
- **One core, three shells**: No fork. Every consumer feature must upgrade cleanly to SMB and Enterprise tiers.

## Differentiators (Non-Negotiable)

- **Receipts-by-default**: Every action emits signed, content-addressed receipts.
- **Deny-by-default policy**: Observe/Assist/Autopilot modes are policy-enforced.
- **Signed skills + sandbox probes**: Supply chain integrity is a product feature.
- **Scoped credentials only**: No ambient credentials, no open egress.
- **Auditor-grade traceability**: Evidence bundles prove what ran, what it did, and why.

## Conversion Ladder (Single Core, Escalating Controls)

1. **Consumer**
   - Trust dashboard, receipts, guided workflows, budgets, safe modes.
   - No admin overhead, instant governance visibility.
2. **White-Label SMB**
   - Tenant overlays, admin console lite, branded UX, exportable audits.
   - Team policies and shared playbooks with receipts.
3. **Enterprise Bridge**
   - SSO/SCIM, residency, compliance bundles, private connectors.
   - Multi-tenant hardening + regulated evidence export.

## Pricing & Packaging (Intent)

- **Consumer**: Low friction, transparent usage, bundled receipts and governance.
- **SMB**: Per-seat with governance premium; includes audit bundles and admin controls.
- **Enterprise**: Contracted tiers with residency, advanced policy, and private connectors.

## Proof Artifacts (Sales Accelerator)

- Evidence bundles with receipts and policy decisions.
- Deterministic replay reports.
- Audit-ready exports with redaction proofs.

## Launch Narrative (Factual, Citation-Safe)

Switchboard positions against the trust gap: not “more autonomy,” but “verifiable autonomy.” Every claim is backed by an evidence artifact, not marketing language.

## Success Metrics

- Receipt adoption rate (receipts viewed vs. actions)
- Policy clarity (time-to-understand and resolution in <10s)
- Deterministic replay pass rate
- Upgrade conversion (consumer → SMB → enterprise)
