# Entropy Governance
Architecture drift is a systems problem, not a people problem.

## Core Pillars
1. **Continuous Enforcement**: Rules must run in CI.
2. **Decision-Time Context**: Surface ADRs and owners when files change.
3. **Cognitive Load Budgets**: Enforce limits on complexity.

## Rule Governance
Policies are versioned and owned by specific teams.
- Rules start as `warn` to collect baselines.
- Rules promote to `fail` once stable.
