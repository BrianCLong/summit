# Agent-First Positioning Policy

**Last updated:** 2025-09-28  
**Owner:** CEO + Product Marketing  
**Approvers:** CRO, Head of People, General Counsel

---

## 1. Purpose
Establish binding guidelines for how Topicality communicates, proves, and governs its agent-first positioning. The policy ensures every external and internal asset reinforces our employment-safe pledge, mission, vision, and values while meeting governance and compliance requirements.

## 2. Scope
- Applies to all go-to-market, product marketing, investor, and recruiting materials referencing Topicality agents.
- Covers written collateral, presentations, demos, web properties, and analyst briefings.
- Includes partner- or customer-co-created artifacts when Topicality branding or claims are present.

## 3. Guiding Principles
1. **Human Amplification** – Messaging must show how agents elevate people, never replace them. Reference the [employment commitment](../sales/topicality-agent-first-positioning-pack.md#5-the-employment-commitment-external-social-contract) in all core assets.
2. **Provable Governance** – Claims require disclosure packs, audit trails, or metrics that satisfy the [Documentation Governance Charter](../governance/documentation-charter.md) and [COMPLIANCE](../COMPLIANCE.md) obligations.
3. **Mission & Vision Alignment** – Positioning must map back to the [Mission, Vision & Values statements](../governance/mission-vision-values.md), emphasizing sustainable human leverage.
4. **Evidence-Backed Outcomes** – Quantitative results include source references (Maestro run IDs, IntelGraph dashboards, customer attestations) with update cadences defined in §7.
5. **Employment Safety First** – Any content implying workforce reduction is prohibited. Exceptions require General Counsel and Head of People approval (§9).

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Product Marketing (Owner):** Maintains the [Positioning Pack](../sales/topicality-agent-first-positioning-pack.md), collateral inventory, and messaging QA.
- **Sales Leadership:** Verifies use of current assets, logs deviations, and feeds learnings into quarterly updates.
- **Customer Success:** Collects proof artifacts (attestations, disclosure packs) and validates claims before publication.
- **People Team:** Ensures messaging reflects employment programs, reskilling budgets, and promotion metrics.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Reviews high-impact assets (press, investor decks, website) for policy adherence.

## 5. Required Collateral
The following artifacts must exist, remain up-to-date, and link back to this policy:
- [Topicality Agent-First Positioning Pack](../sales/topicality-agent-first-positioning-pack.md)
- Employment pledge overview and attestation template (§5 of the pack)
- One-page summaries for investors, recruiting, and enterprise buyers (§19 of the pack)
- Sales deck outline and talk tracks (see §20 of the pack)
- Governance evidence bundle (disclosure pack template, policy labels, rollback plan)

## 6. Governance & Review Cadence
- **Quarterly:** Policy review with CEO, CRO, Head of People, and General Counsel.
- **Monthly:** Collateral audit led by Product Marketing to confirm links, metrics, and references are current.
- **Event-Driven:** Immediate review for major launches, employment policy updates, or governance changes.

## 7. Evidence Management
- **Metric Sources:** Use Maestro dashboards, IntelGraph analytics, and customer attestations stored in the governance log.
- **Freshness Standards:** Quantitative claims must be refreshed every 90 days or tagged with collection date.
- **Version Control:** All collateral lives in Git with semantic version tags; change history retained per [Documentation Governance Charter](../governance/documentation-charter.md#version-control-and-change-management).

## 8. Distribution Controls
- Publish externally only after approvals recorded in the governance log.
- Provide internal briefing notes explaining where collateral lives, when to use it, and how to request updates.
- Maintain access controls for pre-release materials using the security practices defined in [SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY](../SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md).

## 9. Exception Handling
- Submit exception requests via Governance Council ticket with justification, risk assessment, and mitigation plan.
- Exceptions expire after 30 days unless renewed by the approving executives.
- Document all exceptions in the policy log referenced by the [Governance Style Guide](../governance/style-guide.md).

## 10. Compliance Verification Checklist
- [ ] Messaging ties to mission, vision, and values.
- [ ] Employment pledge cited with latest attestation status.
- [ ] Evidence links verified and dated within 90 days.
- [ ] Governance artifacts (policy labels, disclosure packs) attached or referenced.
- [ ] Approvals captured from Product Marketing, Legal, and People teams.
