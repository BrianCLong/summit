# Entry Tier 1 — Trust Beachheads (Primary Entry)

These are environments where decisions are high-impact, audits are inevitable, failure cost dwarfs software cost, and calm, legible control is valued.

## Tier 1A: Security & Incident Governance (SOC / SecOps)

**Why this first**
* Constant decision pressure.
* Existing tools are noisy and brittle.
* Executives already expect oversight.
* ROI is immediate (incident cost reduction).

**Summit Positioning**
> "Decision governance for incidents and automated response."

**Initial Use Cases**
1. **Governed response approval**: "Human-in-the-loop" with full context.
2. **Evidence-backed incident actions**: Every action linked to intelligence.
3. **Refusal and non-action justification**: Why we *didn't* block that IP.
4. **Post-incident replay without blame**: Perfect causal graphs for post-mortems.

**Why This Compounds**
* Builds **decision memory** fast.
* Produces audit artifacts immediately.
* Creates executive trust early.

## Tier 1B: Compliance & Audit Infrastructure

**Why this next**
* Compliance teams are chronically underpowered.
* Automation scares them—unless it is legible.
* Summit reframes automation as *audit-first*.

**Summit Positioning**
> "Continuous auditability for automated systems."

**Initial Use Cases**
1. **Evidence generation**: Automated collection of proof for controls.
2. **Control enforcement**: Policy-as-code that auditors can read.
3. **Drift detection**: "The system changed in unauthorized ways."
4. **Regulator-grade explanations**: Natural language justification for system state.

**Why This Compounds**
* Compliance becomes a sponsor, not a blocker.
* Evidence reuse lowers cost across the organization.
* Locks Summit into annual audit cycles (extremely sticky).
