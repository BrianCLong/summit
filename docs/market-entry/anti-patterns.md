# Market Entry Anti-Patterns (Explicitly Avoid)

To preserve the compounding advantage, we must avoid these common traps.

## The Traps

1.  **Starting with productivity use cases**
    - _Why bad_: Productivity tools are easily swapped and commoditized. They fight for "eyeballs." Summit fights for "truth."

2.  **Selling to innovation teams first**
    - _Why bad_: Innovation labs have low budgets and low influence on production infrastructure. We want "mandatory," not "experimental."

3.  **Feature-by-feature comparisons**
    - _Why bad_: We are not a better JIRA or a better Splunk. We are a layer _above_ them. Comparison invites commoditization.

4.  **Freemium models**
    - _Why bad_: Trust is not free. High-assurance governance implies value. Freemium attracts low-stakes users, diluting the brand.

5.  **Over-customization early**
    - _Why bad_: Creates consulting-ware, not a platform. We build the _standard_ for governance, not bespoke workflows.

These all destroy compounding by positioning Summit as "just another tool."
