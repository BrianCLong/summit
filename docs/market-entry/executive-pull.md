# Entry Tier 3 — Executive & Strategic Adoption

This tier happens **organically**, not via sales. It is the result of success in Tier 1 and Tier 2.

## Executive Value Realized

- **Fewer escalations**: Systems handle the routine; humans handle the novel.
- **Clear accountability**: "Who approved this?" is answered instantly.
- **Predictable risk posture**: Real-time view of compliance and security.
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Trust in the "Decision Integrity Layer."

## Summit Becomes

- The system executives trust when stakes are high.
- The arbiter when teams disagree (provenance solves disputes).
- The evidence source during scrutiny (board meetings, external audits).

At this point, Summit is **non-removable**. It is the nervous system of the enterprise.
