# Geographic / Sector Sequencing

## Ideal Early Sectors

1.  **Financial Services**
    - High regulation, high transaction volume, high cost of failure.
    - Need for "explainability" is legal, not just nice-to-have.

2.  **Critical Infrastructure**
    - Energy, Utilities, Telecom.
    - Zero tolerance for unexplained downtime or unauthorized changes.

3.  **Defense-adjacent Enterprises**
    - Supply chain for defense; requires high assurance (CMMC, etc.).

4.  **Regulated SaaS Platforms**
    - Fintechs, Healthtechs.
    - Existential need to prove security to _their_ customers.

5.  **Large Healthcare Systems (Later)**
    - High need, but slow sales cycles and complex legacy integration.

## Avoid Early

- **SMB**: Too small to feel the pain of coordination/governance chaos.
- **Startups**: Move too fast, rarely value governance until IPO.
- **Consumer**: Low stakes per decision.
- **Unregulated Markets**: Hard to justify the "Control Plane" value.
