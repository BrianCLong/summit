# Switchboard Personal Agent + White-Label Wedge Strategy (OpenClaw Moment)

## Summit Readiness Assertion

This strategy is governed by the Summit Readiness Assertion and enforces aligned definitions, authority files, and evidence-first execution across all assets and releases. See `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md` for the authoritative readiness contract.

## Executive Intent (Present + Future Only)

Switchboard will use the OpenClaw hype window to enter the consumer market with a **provable, governed personal agent** and **white-label variants** that outperform insecure alternatives on trust, traceability, and cost discipline. Revenue and proof artifacts from the consumer wedge will directly finance the enterprise-grade evolution of the same core runtime, proving market pull while compressing enterprise sales risk.

## Evidence-First Output (UEF Bundle)

All claims, launches, and growth decisions ship with a minimal **UEF (Unified Evidence File)** bundle:

- **Receipts**: deterministic action receipts per run (hashed, signed, replayable).
- **Policy Decisions**: allow/deny rationale with rule IDs and inputs hash.
- **Skill Provenance**: signature verification, build provenance, and sandbox suite results.
- **Cost Ledger**: token, infra, and egress spend with caps and alerts.
- **Governed Exceptions**: any exception is logged as a governed exception with explicit owner and expiry.

## Strategy Pillars

1. **Provable Security by Default**
   - Deny-by-default policy gates, capability-scoped permissions, and sandboxed execution.
   - Receipts are content-addressed and signed for audit-grade traceability.

2. **Governed Skills, Not a Plugin Free-For-All**
   - Every skill is signed, permission-scoped, and reproducible.
   - Skill store is curated; “verified” badge requires sandbox probes and provenance checks.

3. **Autonomy With Receipts**
   - `Observe → Assist → Autopilot` modes enforced by policy.
   - Autopilot limited to pre-approved workflows with rate and spend caps.

4. **Cheaper Than Insecure Alternatives**
   - Local-first execution, model routing, caching, and explicit budget controls.
   - Clear pricing that eliminates hidden infra costs and surprise spend.

5. **Enterprise-Grade Core from Day One**
   - Consumer runtime emits evidence bundles compatible with enterprise compliance needs.
   - White-label SKUs retain governance, auditability, and policy controls.

## Product Ladder (Consumer → White-Label → Enterprise)

### A) Switchboard Personal Agent (Consumer)

- Multi-channel agent with receipts on by default.
- Assist-mode approvals for privileged actions.
- Trust dashboard with action timeline, skill provenance, and cost ledger.

### B) White-Label Agent (Creators / SMB / Teams)

- Branded instance with tenant policies, role controls, audit exports.
- Bring-your-own-model keys or managed keys.
- Centralized admin: kill switches, retention, and policy overlays.

### C) Enterprise Bridge (Strategic Target)

- SSO/SAML, SCIM, data residency.
- Evidence bundles and compliance exports (SOC2/ISO-ready).
- Private connectors and VPC/on-prem deployment options.

## Market Entry Plan (60-Day Wedge)

### Phase 1: Wedge MVP (Weeks 1–2)

- Launch personal agent on two channels (Telegram + email).
- Ship receipts, approvals, and baseline policy enforcement.
- Deliver 5 verified skills: Inbox Triage, Calendar Concierge, Daily Brief, Meeting Notes → Actions, File Organizer.

### Phase 2: Verified Skills Credibility (Weeks 3–4)

- Publish skill signing + provenance verification workflow.
- Add sandbox probe suite + danger probes for verified badge.
- Expand to 12 verified skills.

### Phase 3: White-Label + Growth Loop (Weeks 5–8)

- White-label tenant configuration and branding.
- Shareable redacted receipts for growth and trust signals.
- Expand to 25 verified skills.

## Pricing Ladder (Clear, Lower Cost, Governed)

- **Free**: Local-only, limited skills, receipts, assist mode.
- **Pro ($9–$19)**: Sync, premium skills, managed sandbox.
- **White-Label ($49–$99)**: Brand, policies, admin controls.
- **Enterprise**: per-seat + connectors + residency + compliance bundles.

## White-Label Differentiators (Only We Do This Better)

- **Policy overlays per tenant** with deterministic audit trails.
- **Skill attestations** that are verifiable and portable.
- **Governed exception log** for fast approvals without silent bypass.
- **Receipts-as-API** for external audits and compliance export.

## Risk Controls (No Policy Bypass)

- **No unverified skills** in consumer tier; verified skills only.
- **No raw shell access** in consumer tier; dev skills gated with stricter policy.
- **Network egress allowlists** and explicit data boundary checks.
- **Mandatory receipts** for every action; replay is read-only by default.

## MAESTRO Threat Modeling Alignment

- **MAESTRO Layers**: Foundation, Data, Agents, Tools, Infra, Observability, Security.
- **Threats Considered**: prompt injection, malicious skill supply chain, credential exfiltration, policy bypass, tool misuse, cross-tenant data leakage.
- **Mitigations**: deny-by-default policies, signed skill bundles, sandbox isolation, scoped tokens, strict egress allowlists, receipt ledger with signatures, anomaly detection hooks.

## Governance & Alignment Requirements

- All artifacts must reference the same authority files and definitions.
- Every exception is explicitly logged as a **Governed Exception** with owner and expiry.
- Evidence bundles are required for any launch, pricing change, or policy adjustment.

## Success Metrics (Non-Optional)

- **Trust**: ≥ 99% of actions with verified receipts and signature validation.
- **Safety**: 0 policy bypass incidents; 100% sandbox pass rate for verified skills.
- **Efficiency**: median cost per task lower than open alternatives with same capability.
- **Enterprise Bridge**: every consumer run produces a compliant evidence bundle.

## Forward-Leaning Enhancement (State-of-the-Art)

Introduce **Receipt-Driven Simulation**: a deterministic replay engine that can re-run receipts in a safe, read-only sandbox to validate outcomes, detect drift, and produce compliance-grade attestations without re-executing real-world side effects.

## Immediate Next Actions (Locked Scope)

1. Publish the wedge landing page + trust dashboard preview.
2. Finalize Verified Skill v0.1 policy checklist and signing workflow.
3. Build the receipts ledger and redaction layer.
4. Launch the first five verified skills with reproducible bundles.
5. Stand up the white-label tenant admin console.

## Final State

Switchboard will own the “trustworthy personal agent” category, monetize quickly with a governed consumer wedge, and convert that momentum into enterprise-scale deployment with provable security, traceability, and cost superiority.
