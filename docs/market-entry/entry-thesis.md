# Market Entry Thesis: Asymmetric Entry

> *You do not enter markets by convincing buyers. You enter by solving problems that buyers cannot afford to mishandle.*

## Core Market Entry Thesis

Summit (IntelGraph) solves the problem of **decision integrity** in high-stakes environments. We are not selling a tool; we are deploying a **governance substrate**.

Summit should first appear **where failure is unacceptable and explanation is mandatory**.

## Entry Principle (Non-Negotiable)

Summit **must not** enter as:
* A generic "AI platform"
* A dashboard
* A productivity accelerator
* A replacement for existing tools

Summit **must** enter as:
* A **governance substrate**
* A **decision integrity layer**
* A **risk-reducing control plane**

## Strategic Imperative

We are sequencing adoption to maximize compounding advantage. By starting where trust is binary (you have it or you don't) and compliance is mandatory, we bypass the "optional tool" trap.

Once established as the source of truth for high-consequence decisions (Tier 1), expansion into adjacent domains (Tier 2) becomes a pull-motion, driven by the desire for the same level of autonomy and safety.
