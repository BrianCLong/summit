# Non-Escalatory Containment Protocols

This document outlines the set of non-escalatory containment protocols available within the Summit platform. These protocols are designed to neutralize adversarial activity without confronting the adversary directly or signaling that their actions have been detected.

## Breakthrough Concept

> Most counter-intelligence failures escalate too early.

The core principle behind these protocols is to manage and mitigate adversarial influence through quiet containment, preserving the element of surprise and avoiding unnecessary escalation. The goal is to defend, not to engage. Defense should be calm and boring.

## The Containment Protocol

When an adversarial pattern is detected and the attribution confidence reaches a pre-defined threshold, the following containment measures can be activated. These actions are designed to be low-profile and to minimize the risk of alerting the adversary.

- **Quiet Containment**: Isolate the suspect information or actor within the system, preventing it from influencing broader analytical processes. This is analogous to a soft quarantine, where the contained entity is still observable but can no longer cause harm.
- **Decision Sandboxing**: Route any decisions or analytical products that have been influenced by the contained entity into a sandboxed environment. In this environment, the potential impact of the decision can be evaluated without affecting the live operational environment.
- **Narrative Quarantine**: If a manipulative narrative is detected, it can be placed in quarantine. This means that while the narrative is still tracked and analyzed, it is flagged as suspect and prevented from being cited as a source in new intelligence products.
- **Authority Revalidation**: If an impersonator is detected, the system can trigger a revalidation of the authority or identity that is being co-opted. This is done through out-of-band channels and does not require a direct challenge to the impersonator.

## Protocol Governance

The activation of any containment protocol is a significant event and is subject to the following governance requirements:

- **No Public Alerts**: The system will not generate any public alerts or notifications that could signal the activation of a containment protocol.
- **No Attribution Claims**: The activation of a protocol does not require a formal attribution claim. The focus is on mitigating the behavior, not on identifying the actor.
- **No Reactive Signaling**: The system is designed to avoid any change in its observable behavior that could indicate to an adversary that they are under scrutiny.

By adhering to these principles, the Non-Escalatory Containment Protocol provides a powerful set of tools for managing adversarial activity in a way that is both effective and discreet.
