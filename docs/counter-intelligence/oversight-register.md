# Counter-Intelligence Oversight Register

This document defines the structure and function of the Counter-Intelligence (CI) Oversight Register. The register is the definitive, auditable record of all counter-intelligence actions taken within the Summit platform. Its purpose is to ensure that these powerful capabilities are used responsibly, ethically, and in accordance with established governance.

## Breakthrough Concept

> Counter-intelligence must itself be auditable.

The very tools designed to detect and counter manipulation must be subject to the highest standards of transparency and accountability. The CI Oversight Register is the primary mechanism for achieving this, providing a permanent and unchangeable record of all CI-related activities.

## The CI Oversight Register

The register is a structured, append-only log that captures the full lifecycle of any defensive measure. Every significant counter-intelligence action, from the initial detection of a pattern to the eventual sunsetting of a defensive measure, is recorded in the register.

Each entry in the register must contain the following information:

- **Who**: The identity of the individual or automated process that approved the defensive action.
- **What**: The specific defensive measure that was activated, referencing the relevant entry in the Containment Protocol.
- **When**: The timestamp of the action.
- **Why**: The specific evidence that was used to justify the action, including a link to the relevant entry in the Attribution Ledger and the assessed level of attribution confidence.
- **For How Long**: The duration for which the defensive measure will remain active. No defensive measure can be permanent; all must have a pre-defined sunset clause.
- **With What Review Cadence**: The schedule for periodic review of the defensive measure. This ensures that all active measures are regularly re-justified based on the latest available evidence.

## Governance Principles

The CI Oversight Register is governed by the following core principles:

- **Immutable Record**: The register is an append-only log. Entries cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Mandatory Justification**: No counter-intelligence action can be taken without a corresponding entry in the register.
- **Periodic Re-justification**: All active defensive measures must be periodically reviewed and re-justified. Failure to do so will result in the automatic sunsetting of the measure.
- **Human in the Loop**: While the system can propose actions, all significant defensive measures must be approved by a designated human authority.

By enforcing these principles, the CI Oversight Register ensures that Summit's counter-intelligence capabilities are a tool for defense, not a potential vector for abuse. It provides the foundation of trust upon which the entire counter-intelligence framework is built.
