# Attribution Ledger

The Attribution Ledger is the formal system within Summit for managing and documenting the process of attributing observed adversarial patterns to specific actors. It is designed to prevent reckless conclusions and to ensure that defensive actions are gated by a deliberate and evidence-based assessment of attribution confidence.

## Breakthrough Concept

> You do not need to name the adversary to constrain them.

This principle is embodied in the Attribution Ledger, which separates the act of detection from the act of accusation, allowing Summit to take defensive measures without making premature or unsupported claims of attribution.

## Narrative Framing

> _Defense does not require certainty. Escalation does._

This framing underscores the purpose of the ledger: to enable a measured, risk-based approach to counter-intelligence, where the intensity of the response is proportional to the confidence in the attribution.

## Attribution Confidence Bands

The core of the Attribution Ledger is the use of four distinct confidence bands. All potential attributions must be assigned to one of these bands, and any movement between bands must be justified by new evidence.

- **Unknown**: An adversarial pattern has been detected, but there is insufficient evidence to form a hypothesis about the identity or origin of the actor.
- **Suspected**: There is preliminary evidence suggesting a possible attribution, but it is not yet sufficient to support a firm conclusion. This level of confidence may be used to justify heightened monitoring.
- **Probable**: The body of evidence strongly suggests a specific attribution, and alternative explanations are unlikely. This level of confidence may be used to justify the implementation of targeted, non-escalatory defensive measures.
- **Confirmed**: The evidence for attribution is definitive and has been independently verified. This is the highest level of confidence and is reserved for cases where the evidence is incontrovertible. Actions based on confirmed attribution may include formal escalation or notification to external authorities.

## Ledger Artifacts

The Attribution Ledger is not a single document, but a collection of interconnected artifacts designed to ensure a rigorous and auditable attribution process.

- **Evidence-Linked Hypotheses**: Every attribution hypothesis must be directly linked to the specific evidence that supports it. This ensures that all conclusions are grounded in verifiable data.
- **Confidence Decay**: Attribution confidence is not static. The ledger will incorporate a mechanism for confidence to decay over time in the absence of new, corroborating evidence. This prevents outdated or stale assessments from persisting indefinitely.
- **Mandatory Review Thresholds**: Any attribution that reaches the "Probable" or "Confirmed" level must be subject to a mandatory review by a human oversight body. This ensures that all high-confidence attributions are validated before any significant action is taken.
