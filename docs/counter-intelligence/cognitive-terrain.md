# Cognitive Terrain Mapping

This document outlines the concept and application of Cognitive Terrain Mapping within the Summit platform. This is a novel approach to counter-intelligence that focuses on understanding the human elements of the analytical and decision-making environment, rather than just the technical systems.

## Breakthrough Concept

> Adversaries operate on **human cognition**, not systems.

The core idea of Cognitive Terrain Mapping is to make the cognitive landscape of an organization legible, allowing for the identification of areas that may be under stress or otherwise susceptible to manipulation. This is not about monitoring individuals, but about understanding the systemic pressures and bottlenecks that can create cognitive vulnerabilities.

## The Cognitive Terrain Map

The primary artifact of this process is the Cognitive Terrain Map, a dynamic representation of the cognitive state of the organization. This map is used for **defensive reinforcement**, not exploitation. It is a tool for identifying where to allocate resources to support better decision-making, not for targeting or influencing internal actors.

The map is designed to visualize the following key indicators:

- **Stress Indicators**: Identifying teams or analytical units that are consistently operating under high pressure, as indicated by factors such as high workloads, tight deadlines, or a high volume of critical decisions. These are areas where cognitive biases are more likely to take hold.
- **Decision Bottlenecks**: Pinpointing locations in the decision-making process where a single individual or a small group is responsible for a disproportionate number of critical choices. These bottlenecks can be a single point of failure and a prime target for adversarial pressure.
- **Narrative Susceptibility Zones**: Identifying areas where a particular narrative or interpretation of events is gaining traction without sufficient evidentiary support. This can indicate a successful influence operation or a pre-existing cognitive bias that is being exploited.
- **Authority Ambiguity**: Highlighting areas where there is a lack of clear ownership or authority over a particular decision or domain. This ambiguity can be exploited by adversaries to create confusion or to push through unauthorized actions.

By mapping these factors, Summit can provide a clear and actionable picture of the organization's cognitive landscape, enabling a proactive and supportive approach to counter-intelligence that strengthens the human element of the decision-making process.
