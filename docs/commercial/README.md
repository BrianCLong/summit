# Commercial Readiness Pack

## 1. Start Here for Commercial Conversations

This directory contains a set of documents designed to support commercial and procurement conversations about the Summit Platform's General Availability (GA) release. Every document in this pack is "technically truthful" and directly traceable to the platform's verified state.

Our approach is to provide a transparent, evidence-based view of the platform's capabilities, security posture, and support boundaries. We believe this builds the trust necessary for successful partnerships.

## 2. The "Truth-Lock" Statement

All claims, scopes, and statements made in this commercial pack are anchored to the state of the codebase as of the following Git commit:

**GA Baseline Commit Hash:** `6bb2e0f68e7bcdd96e5ffc114429f57f98938acd`

The two foundational documents that define this baseline are:
- `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md`: The absolute declaration of certified and deferred capabilities.
- `docs/security/SECURITY-ISSUE-LEDGER.md`: The transparent record of our internal security audit and remediation plan.

This "truth-lock" ensures that all commercial discussions are grounded in a single, immutable, and verifiable source of truth.
