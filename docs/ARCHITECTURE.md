# Maestro Architecture Overview

Maestro is a robust orchestration service designed to automate and coordinate complex workflows, particularly for building, testing, and deploying IntelGraph services. Its architecture is modular, scalable, and built with production readiness in mind.

## 1. Core Components

- **API Gateway**: The primary interface for interacting with Maestro, exposing endpoints for triggering, managing, and querying orchestration runs. Implements health (`/healthz`), readiness (`/readyz`), and metrics (`/metrics`) endpoints.
- **Orchestrator Engine**: The brain of Maestro, responsible for parsing workflow definitions, scheduling tasks, managing state, and ensuring idempotency and retries for reliable execution.
- **Data Stores**:
  - **PostgreSQL**: Used for persistent storage of workflow definitions, run metadata, audit logs, and other critical state.
  - **Redis**: Utilized for high-speed caching, coordination locks, and managing idempotency keys.
- **Kafka**: Serves as the backbone for asynchronous communication and event streaming, enabling decoupled components and scalable ingestion of orchestration events.

## 2. Deployment & Infrastructure

Maestro is designed for cloud-native environments, primarily targeting Kubernetes deployments.

- **Containerization**: Dockerized applications built with multi-stage Dockerfiles, using distroless images for minimal attack surface.
- **Kubernetes**: Deployed via Helm charts, leveraging Kubernetes primitives like Deployments, Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs), NetworkPolicies, and RBAC.
- **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)**:
  - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automates linting, testing, building, SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning (Trivy), and image signing (Cosign).
  - **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Manages ephemeral preview environments for pull requests and progressive deployments to development clusters.

## 3. Security Posture

Security is a first-class concern in Maestro's design, incorporating defense-in-depth principles.

- **Authentication (AuthN)**: OIDC SSO for user authentication and JWT validation for API access.
- **Authorization (AuthZ)**: Policy-driven access controls via Open Policy Agent (OPA) for fine-grained authorization of workflow actions.
- **Network Security**: mTLS for secure service-to-service communication and Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for enforcing least-privilege network access.
- **Secrets Management**: Integration with Kubernetes secret stores (e.g., Sealed Secrets, Vault) to prevent secrets from being baked into images or exposed in logs.
- **Supply Chain Security**: Image signing and provenance (SLSA-style attestations) to ensure the integrity and authenticity of deployed artifacts.

## 4. Observability

Comprehensive observability is built into Maestro to provide deep insights into its operation and performance.

- **Metrics**: Exposed via Prometheus (`/metrics` endpoint), tracking key performance indicators like workflow execution times, success/failure rates, and queue depths.
- **Tracing**: Implemented using OpenTelemetry, providing distributed tracing across services and tasks for end-to-end visibility of request flows.
- **Structured Logging**: All logs are structured (JSON format) and include correlation IDs (`traceId`, `spanId`) for easier debugging and analysis in centralized logging systems.

## 5. Reliability & Resilience

Maestro incorporates several patterns to ensure high reliability and resilience:

- **Idempotency**: Workflows are designed to be replay-safe, preventing unintended side effects from repeated executions.
- **Retries & Backoff**: Tasks include exponential backoff and maximum retry attempts to handle transient failures.
- **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ)**: For handling messages that cannot be processed successfully, preventing system blockages.
- **Health Probes**: Liveness, readiness, and startup probes ensure the application's health and proper lifecycle management within Kubernetes.
