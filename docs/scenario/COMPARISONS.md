# Scenario Comparison & Narratives

## 1. Overview

This document defines the standard scenarios used for strategic planning and the methodology for comparing them.

## 2. Standard Futures

### 2.1. Future A: "Conservative / Defensive"

- **Theme**: Protection, Compliance, Slow Growth.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Growth: 20% YoY.
  - Regulation: Strict/Hostile.
  - Autonomy: Tier 1 (Human-in-the-loop) only.
  - Focus: Cost control and risk minimization.

### 2.2. Future B: "Balanced / Pragmatic"

- **Theme**: Sustainable Growth, Managed Risk.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Growth: 50% YoY.
  - Regulation: Moderate (Current trajectory).
  - Autonomy: Tier 2 (Oversight) for non-critical paths.
  - Focus: Efficiency and feature velocity.

### 2.3. Future C: "Aggressive / Exponential"

- **Theme**: Market Dominance, High Innovation.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Growth: 150% YoY.
  - Regulation: Permissive / Agile compliance.
  - Autonomy: Tier 3 (Semi-autonomous) widely deployed.
  - Focus: Scale and disruption.

## 3. Narrative Explanations

For each comparison, the system generates narrative explanations.

- **Divergence Points**: "In Year 2, Future C diverges significantly in cost due to autonomy efficiency, while Future A struggles with linear scaling costs."
- **Key Levers**: "The primary driver for the reliability drop in Future C is the accelerated tenant onboarding rate without proportional infrastructure investment."

## 4. Comparison Methodology

- **Baseline**: Future B is typically used as the baseline.
- **Delta Analysis**: Reporting percentage differences in key metrics relative to the baseline.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: "What single variable change would make Future B look like Future C?"
