# Project: Content Calendar â€” GTM, Docs, Social

## Purpose

To plan, track, and coordinate all external-facing content, including Go-to-Market (GTM) assets, documentation, and social media posts.

## Content Workflow

1.  **Draft**: Content is created and assigned an owner.
2.  **In Review**: Content is reviewed by relevant stakeholders (e.g., legal, marketing, product).
3.  **Published**: Content is live.
4.  **Archived**: Content is no longer active but retained for historical purposes.

## Campaign Management

Each major content initiative is linked to a `Campaign`. This allows for tracking the performance and impact of content related to specific product launches or marketing efforts.
