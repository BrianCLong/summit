# Project: Design System â€” Tokens, Components, Adoption

## Purpose

To manage the lifecycle of design tokens and components, track their adoption across platforms, and ensure consistency in our user interfaces.

## Governance

*   **Design System Council**: Meets bi-weekly to review new components, token changes, and adoption metrics.
*   **Contribution Guidelines**: All new components or significant token changes must follow the [Design System Contribution Guide](link-to-guide).

## Versioning

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for the Design System. Breaking changes are communicated at least one sprint in advance.

## Breaking Changes Policy

1.  Announce breaking changes in the `#design-system` Slack channel and relevant engineering channels.
2.  Provide clear migration paths and documentation.
3.  Deprecate old components/tokens for at least one major release before removal.
