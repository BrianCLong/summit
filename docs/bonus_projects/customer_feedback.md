# Project: Customer Feedback â€” Intake & Insights

## Purpose

To centralize, triage, and analyze customer feedback from various sources to inform product development and improve customer satisfaction.

## Triage Rubric

Feedback is triaged based on `Source`, `Sentiment`, and `Impact`:

*   **High Impact**: Directly affects revenue, retention, or critical user workflows.
*   **Medium Impact**: Affects user experience or efficiency for a significant segment.
*   **Low Impact**: Minor inconvenience or edge case.

## Deduplication SOP

1.  Before creating a new feedback item, search for existing items with similar `Customer` and `Theme`.
2.  If a duplicate is found, add a comment to the existing item and link the new feedback source.
3.  Close the duplicate item, referencing the canonical one.

## NPS Loop

Feedback from NPS surveys is regularly imported and analyzed to identify key themes and sentiment trends.
