# Siteimprove Agentic Content Intelligence: Summit Counter-Position

## Present Signal (Market Pattern)

Siteimprove is selling a unified stack that merges content strategy, SEO/AIO/AEO, accessibility,
and analytics into a single agentic platform. The product line highlights:

- **Content Blueprint AI**: prioritized content actions tied to expected business impact.
- **Mobile Solutions Suite**: mobile accessibility testing combined with app analytics.
- **DXA (Digital Experience Analytics)**: session replay and struggle detection for non-technical teams.
- **Human-in-the-loop** positioning to keep marketers in control while scaling with AI.

## Summit Response (Now + Next)

### 1) Insight → Execution as the default agent contract

Every insight must emit a ranked **Action Plan** with:

- Impact hypothesis and measurable success metric.
- Required change set and owner routing.
- Evidence inputs and policy gate outcomes.

This moves Summit from “recommendations” to **execution-ready decisions** by default.

### 2) Experience telemetry as a first-class graph signal

Session evidence becomes a graph-native signal:

- Rage-clicks, dead-clicks, scroll thrash, and drop-off zones map to **SessionSignal** entities.
- Signals route to owner-backed actions and linked experiments.

### 3) Non-technical activation as a core UX

No-code approvals, previews, and safe commits are the product surface—not an exception path.
All non-technical flows are enforced with **policy gates** and audit-ready evidence bundles.

### 4) Accessibility-as-code across web + mobile

Accessibility checks are CI-grade policy controls:

- Failing checks block release by default.
- Waivers are handled as **Governed Exceptions** with explicit expiry.
- Compliance evidence is preserved longitudinally.

## Moat Moves (Exceed the Category)

### A) Evidence-native operations

Every recommendation and action generates an **Evidence Bundle**:

- Inputs, policy decisions, diffs, owners, and approvals.
- Outcome metrics linked to the original hypothesis.
- Immutable provenance events for audit and compliance.

### B) Strategy Compiler (Graph-native planning)

Summit compiles strategy into a dependency graph:

- **Initiative → Asset → Experiment → Outcome**
- Automatic reconciliation against telemetry signals.
- Hypothesis generation and owner routing with ticket/PR linkage.

### C) AEO readiness as a measurable gate

Summit enforces AEO readiness via structured answer linting:

- Schema completeness, citation fidelity, clarity, and freshness.
- Provenance-weighted retrieval ensures public content is safe to quote.

### D) Cross-channel parity by default

Unified coverage for web, mobile, and app-store surfaces ensures that accessibility, analytics,
and AI readiness move in lockstep.

## Atomic PR Backlog (Execution-Ready)

1. **Strategy Compiler Schema**
   - Entities: Initiative, Asset, QueryCluster, Experiment, Metric, SessionSignal,
     AccessibilityFinding.
2. **Insight → Action Plan Generator**
   - Ranked actions with impact, confidence, owner routing, and success metrics.
3. **Session Replay Ingestion Adapter**
   - Struggle detection events (rage-click, dead-click, scroll thrash) as graph signals.
4. **Accessibility Pipeline (Web + Mobile)**
   - Artifact ingestion and policy gate hooks.
5. **Evidence Bundle + Approval UX**
   - Human-in-loop enforcement with immutable audit trail.

## Authority Alignment

All competitive execution aligns to the Summit Readiness Assertion and the governance
framework defined in `docs/governance/CONSTITUTION.md`. This ensures every action is
policy-bound, auditable, and enforceable.
