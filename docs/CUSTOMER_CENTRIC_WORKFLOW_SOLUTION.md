# Customer-Centric Workflow Solution Blueprint

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14

## üéØ Purpose
Deliver guided, customer-centric workflows that speed acquisition decisions, surface risks and alternatives early, and provide measurable impact on modernization and sustainment programs. This blueprint orients design, delivery, and iteration around real user outcomes.

## üë• Primary Personas
| Persona | Goals | Frustrations Today | Workflow Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition Lead | Rapidly compare options, justify selections, and secure approvals. | Siloed data, opaque risk posture. | Guided playbooks with auto-populated evidence, executive-ready outputs. |
| Risk Analyst | Identify compliance, cyber, and supply risks. | Manual document review, late risk discovery. | Inline risk scoring, scenario comparisons, mitigation libraries. |
| Sustainment Manager | Plan modernization and lifecycle costs. | Fragmented sustainment data, unclear ROI. | Forecasting models, modernization roadmaps, cost/benefit insights. |

## üß≠ Experience Principles
1. **Guidance First:** Every workflow step includes contextual explanations, examples, and recommended actions.
2. **Data-in-Context:** Aggregate acquisition, risk, and sustainment data into a unified workspace with inline analytics.
3. **Decision Transparency:** Generate traceable decision logs, audit trails, and justification summaries automatically.
4. **Measurable Outcomes:** Each workflow emits KPIs tied to cycle time, risk posture, and modernization value.
5. **Accessibility:** Responsive UI, keyboard navigation, and WCAG AA compliance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Architecture
```
User Interaction Layer (React / Design System)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Guided Flow Engine (state machine + rules)
      ‚îú‚îÄ Decision Support Services (promptloop scoring, analytics)
      ‚îú‚îÄ Risk Intel Integrations (compliance DB, threat feeds)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Modernization Toolkit (roadmaps, cost models)
          ‚îî‚îÄ Data Platform (GraphQL API + warehouse views)
```

### Components
- **Guided Flow Engine:** JSON/YAML-defined flows parsed into a state machine. Supports branching logic, guardrails, and persona-specific steps.
- **Promptloop Decision Copilot:** Uses `promptloop` for qualitative risk narratives, alternative summaries, and modernization recommendations.
- **Risk Signal Hub:** Normalizes supplier, cyber, and compliance data. Flags anomalies and attaches mitigations.
- **Modernization Optimizer:** Blends sustainment backlog, capability gaps, and cost models to propose modernization pathways.
- **Outcome Tracker:** Captures per-step telemetry (time-on-task, skipped steps, satisfaction scores) to fuel KPI dashboards.

## üöÄ Guided Workflow Templates
### 1. Acquisition Readiness Sprint
1. Intake requirements (import from CRM, attach mission context).
2. Auto-evaluate vendor pool (capabilities, compliance posture, sustainment maturity).
3. Promptloop generates executive summary and recommended shortlist.
4. Review alternatives and risk overlays; accept mitigation plans.
5. Export decision dossier (PDF, dashboard link) and push to governance system.

**KPIs:** Cycle time ‚â§ 5 days, ‚â•90% dossier completion, risk acceptance logged in 100% of cases.

### 2. Risk Deep-Dive Accelerator
1. Triggered by high-risk signals or manual request.
2. Guided investigation with checklist tailored by risk type.
3. Inline evidence capture (artifacts, third-party attestations, AI-generated rationale).
4. Scenario testing with ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù branch to compare mitigations.
5. Auto-generate risk posture update for leadership and sustainment teams.

**KPIs:** Mean Time to Risk Clarity < 24 hours, 80% mitigations tracked to closure, customer satisfaction ‚â• 4.5/5.

### 3. Modernization & Sustainment Optimizer
1. Aggregate sustainment backlog, capability maps, and budget envelopes.
2. Promptloop synthesizes modernization pathways with quantified trade-offs.
3. Guided workshop to evaluate alternatives and align stakeholders.
4. Export modernization roadmap with phased investments and sustainment impacts.
5. Feed approved roadmap into program management tools and update telemetry.

**KPIs:** 20% reduction in sustainment cost overruns, modernization backlog aging < 90 days, user adoption ‚â• 75%.

## üìà Measurement & Telemetry
| Metric | Target | Data Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition cycle time | ‚â§ 5 days | Workflow telemetry + CRM timestamps |
| Risk surfacing lead time | ‚â• 30 days before decision gate | Risk signal hub events |
| Alternative coverage | ‚â• 3 viable options per acquisition | Flow engine step completion |
| Modernization ROI uplift | ‚â• 15% vs baseline | Finance & sustainment analytics |
| Task success score | ‚â• 4.5/5 | In-flow NPS-style prompts |

Instrumentation hooks stream to product analytics warehouse with daily Looker dashboards. Promptloop evaluation logs feed continuous quality reviews.

## üîÅ Implementation Roadmap
1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-4):** Stand up unified workflow schema, integrate promptloop, map data sources.
2. **Pilot (Weeks 5-8):** Launch Acquisition Readiness Sprint with 2 pilot teams; capture baseline metrics.
3. **Scale (Weeks 9-12):** Expand to risk and sustainment flows, add persona-specific dashboards.
4. **Optimize (Weeks 13+):** Run quarterly usability benchmarking, iterate flows based on KPI trends.

## ‚úÖ Governance & Feedback Loops
- Monthly customer council to review telemetry, feature requests, and ROI.
- Usability testing cadence: bi-weekly moderated sessions + automated heuristics review.
- Change control board ensures regulatory alignment for acquisition and sustainment policies.
- Embed AI ethics checklist for promptloop outputs (bias, explainability, data residency).

## üìö Enablement Assets
- Quick-start playbooks for each persona.
- Decision dossier templates with auto-fill sections.
- Interactive training modules highlighting risk mitigation best practices.
- Change management communications kit for modernization stakeholders.

## üì¨ Next Steps
- Validate schema with enterprise architects and acquisition SMEs.
- Prioritize integrations (CRM, ERP, security scanners) for data-in-context capability.
- Kick off UX research sprint to co-design guided flows with top customer segments.
