# MIT SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Models) Integration Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

- MIT's SEAL framework enables large language models to issue **self-edits**—synthetic training samples plus update directives—so they can continually fine-tune themselves when exposed to new data or tasks.
- The updated release augments the reinforcement-learning controller that scores candidate self-edits with a hierarchical verifier, reducing regression risk while still enabling rapid adaptation.
- Adopting SEAL can shorten iteration cycles for our agent services, improve response quality in knowledge-dense workflows, and lower manual tuning overhead if we stage the rollout behind strict evaluation and safety guardrails.

## 2. Capability Assessment

| Area                    | Current State                                                                     | SEAL Opportunity                                                                                   | Required Changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Adaptation**    | Offline fine-tunes triggered by release trains; little in-flight personalization. | Incremental self-improvement for high-value domains (intel graph enrichment, compliance drafting). | Introduce SEAL controller + self-edit buffer around baseline instruction-tuned models.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Data Engineering**    | Central feature store + provenance ledger with export restrictions.               | Self-edits create new synthetic data that must be catalogued and license-checked.                  | Extend provenance pipeline to tag, score, and expire self-edits; update OPA policy to treat SEAL-generated data separately. ✅ Implemented: `SelfEditRegistry` stores lifecycle metadata and `SELF_EDIT_SYNTHETIC` license is now blocked without review. |
| **Evaluation**          | Regression suites via ga-graphai runners, manual SMEs for red-teaming.            | Automated roll-forward gates using SEAL verifier scores, targeted scenario sampling.               | Build SEAL-aware evaluation harness (ga-graphai/packages/query-copilot + worker test kits).                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Safety & Compliance** | Layered policy enforcement (authz-gateway, cost guard, policy engine).            | SEAL loops risk policy drift if self-edits bypass review.                                          | Bind self-edit application to policy verdicts, add guard-rails for dataset licensing and hallucination filters.                                                                                                                                           |

```

### Integration Touchpoints

1. **Model Services (ga-graphai/packages/graphai, worker, gateway)**
   - Add SEAL controller microservice exposing `POST /self-edits` and `POST /apply` endpoints with RBAC via authz-gateway.
   - Extend worker pipelines to queue SEAL fine-tune jobs, writing metrics back to prov-ledger.
   - Update gateway rate-limits and tracing to flag SEAL-originated adaptations for observability.
2. **Data Governance (policy/opa, prov-ledger, cost-guard)**
   - Add new license type `SELF_EDIT_SYNTHETIC`; enforce embargo on export until SME sign-off.
   - Modify prov-ledger schema to persist self-edit lineage (source prompt, model revision, verifier scores).
   - Align cost guard budgets for additional GPU hours used by SEAL jobs.
3. **Evaluation Stack (ga-graphai/packages/query-copilot, tests/)**
   - Build scenario matrix keyed by domain to evaluate SEAL updates before promotion.
   - Integrate verifier ensemble results into existing ga-graphai test kits with summary dashboards.
   - Author red-team prompts to stress hallucination and policy evasion cases triggered by self-edits.
4. **Operations & Tooling (ops/, infra/helm/, workflows/)**
   - Package SEAL controller and verifier into Helm charts; ensure sealed secrets for API keys.
   - Add GitHub workflow to capture self-edit artifacts (YAML manifest + metrics) as release evidence.
   - Provide runbooks for pause/resume of self-adaptation loops during incidents.

## 4. Rollout Plan

| Phase                        | Timeline   | Scope                                                                                                                     | Exit Criteria                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A. Research & Sandbox**    | Weeks 1-3  | Stand up SEAL controller in isolated environment using smaller instruction-tuned model; ingest synthetic eval corpus.     | Verified improvement ≥5% on sandbox tasks; safety incidents = 0.                                 |
| **B. Internal Pilot**        | Weeks 4-8  | Integrate with ga-graphai staging: enable self-edits for query-copilot only; shadow-mode updates logged but not deployed. | Verifier precision ≥0.9, human review throughput manageable (<4h/day), cost impact within +10%.  |
| **C. Controlled Production** | Weeks 9-14 | Enable SEAL updates for limited customer tenants; require manual approval for promotion.                                  | Two successful adaptation cycles with no SLA breaches; auditors sign off on provenance controls. |
| **D. Broad Adoption**        | Weeks 15+  | Roll out to remaining agent services and documentation workflows with automated approvals guarded by verifier thresholds. | Quarterly review demonstrates sustained quality gains and compliance metrics green.              |

## 5. Governance, Risk, and Compliance

- **Policy Alignment:** Update OPA bundles so `SELF_EDIT_SYNTHETIC` data cannot exit regulated regions without compliance approval. Tie into authz-gateway scopes.
- **Audit Trail:** Prov-ledger must capture self-edit UUIDs, parent dataset hashes, verifier verdicts, and applied checkpoint IDs for traceability.
- **Safety Controls:** Run hallucination, toxicity, and jailbreak probes before activating an edit. Block application if any safety score falls below baseline.
- **Cost Oversight:** Extend cost guard thresholds with SEAL-specific budgets; auto-disable loops when trending above allocated GPU hours.
- **Human Oversight:** Mandate SME review of first N=20 self-edits per domain; use review outcomes to recalibrate verifier thresholds.

## 7. Immediate Next Steps

1. **Source Research Assets:** Pull SEAL paper + reference implementation (pending VentureBeat access; request MIT CSAIL repo once available).
2. **Kickoff Workshop:** Schedule 90-minute session with GraphAI, Applied AI, and Compliance to align on sandbox scope.
3. **Sandbox Build Ticket:** Create Jira epic for SEAL sandbox environment (include GPU allocation, telemetry, safety test harness).
4. **Policy Draft:** Begin drafting `SELF_EDIT_SYNTHETIC` policy updates for OPA and authz-gateway to circulate with Legal for review.
5. **Risk Review:** Add SEAL adoption to next Risk & Controls board meeting agenda to track decisions and mitigations.

## 8. Open Questions

- Do we need differential privacy or encryption-at-rest upgrades for self-edit buffers beyond existing standards?
- Can we reuse current reward models, or must we train SEAL-specific evaluators to achieve desired precision?
- How will we coordinate SEAL updates with release trains to avoid conflicting fine-tunes?

## 9. Implementation Progress (Week 1)

- **Self-Edit Registry:** Added a programmable registry in `@ga-graphai/prov-ledger` to track proposals, verifier outcomes, expirations, and promotion readiness. Scorecards automatically gate status transitions and expose readiness metrics for downstream schedulers.
- **Evaluation Planner:** Query Copilot now builds per-domain evaluation plans from registry data, prioritising verified self-edits and limiting simultaneous runs per domain to avoid GPU contention.
- **Compliance Controls:** OPA export policies recognise the new `SELF_EDIT_SYNTHETIC` license class, blocking exports without `self_edit_reviewed` context and documenting the appeal path.

**Document status:** In progress v0.2 (registry + compliance shipped; awaiting full SEAL research drop to finalise sandbox scope).
