# Decisions: item-UNKNOWN

## Decisions made

- Implemented subsumption bundle scaffolding without ITEM-specific features.
- Enforced deterministic evidence file separation (report/metrics vs stamp).

## Alternatives rejected

- Implementing ITEM features immediately (deferred pending ITEM excerpts).

## Deferred

- Claim registry population and lane-2 innovation until ITEM is provided.

## Risk tradeoffs

- Added new CI job name assumed; requires required-check discovery to finalize.

## GA alignment

- Improves machine-verifiable governance with minimal blast radius.
