# Agentic Skill Gaps Analysis

Five key skill gaps, based on what top agentic platforms and role guides expect versus what Summit is currently optimized for.

## 1. Agent reliability / “agent engineering” discipline

- Modern stacks treat **agent engineering** (turning non-deterministic agent loops into reliable products via iterative eval, guardrails, and redesign) as a distinct skill.
- Gap: strong infra and research mindset, but fewer dedicated cycles and patterns for systematically hardening agent behaviors (loop design, failure modes, recovery paths).

## 2. Safety, security, and policy engineering for agents

- Guides call out **safety & governance** as a core competency: threat modeling, policy design, red-teaming, and secure tool routing for agentic systems.
- Gap: need at least one engineer who “owns” agent security posture (tool policies, MCP/gateway hardening, incident playbooks), not just generic AppSec.

## 3. Knowledge/RAG and data products for agents

- Agent teams need **knowledge curation** and retrieval engineering: building structured KBs, retrieval pipelines, and evals tailored to agents, not just generic RAG.
- Gap: strong graph/IntelGraph background, but missing a dedicated “knowledge engineer” owning schemas, retrieval quality, freshness, and how agents exploit those structures.

## 4. Human–agent workflow and UX/process engineering

- High-performing orgs emphasize **workflow decomposition** and **human–agent collaboration design** (queues, roles, escalations, explainability for humans).
- Gap: plenty of orchestration chops, less bandwidth on explicit service-design/UX skills to make Summit-native flows intuitive for ops/customer teams.

## 5. Enterprise platform & SRE-style operations for agentic stacks

- Enterprise platforms lean on **cloud/SRE skills**: multi-tenant architectures, observability, HA, rollout strategies, and deterministic “safety rails” around non-deterministic models.
- Gap: need deeper, ongoing SRE/platform focus specifically tuned to LLM/agent workloads (trace cardinality, guardrail failures, model routing issues), not just generic webapp ops.
