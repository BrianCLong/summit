# Retention dashboard responsive evidence

The HTML fixture mirrors the `web/retention-dashboard/app/page.tsx` layout with sample data so we can capture responsive screenshots without running the full Next.js app. Load it via a static file server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`) and capture at 375/768/1024 widths.
