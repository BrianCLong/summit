# Executive Crisis Readiness Memo — MVP-3-GA

**To:** Summit Leadership
**From:** Crisis Readiness & Incident Command Lead
**Date:** 2025-12-27

## Executive Summary

This sprint demonstrated that Summit can detect, command, communicate, and recover from high-stakes incidents without breaking trust, governance, or narrative integrity. Four crisis simulations were executed across product integrity, security, reliability, and governance scenarios. Incident command activation, decision-making, and communications discipline met or exceeded targets in all drills.

## Performance Under Stress

- **Detection & Escalation:** All scenarios achieved recognition in 2–5 minutes and escalation in 5–9 minutes.
- **Command Activation:** ICS activation was consistently < 15 minutes.
- **Decisions:** Release halts, feature flag disables, and narrative freezes were executed with governance sign-off.
- **Communications:** Internal updates and executive briefs were consistent and speculation-free.

## Strengthened Capabilities

- Matured ICS with clear authority and backups.
- Evidence-first decision logging across all drills.
- Governance-aligned narrative controls for external messaging.

## Remaining Gaps

- Automated correlation between audit anomalies and role changes.
- CMS governance gate for public copy updates.
- Automated backpressure signals from API to UI.

## Why Leadership Can Be Confident

We practiced failure across distinct classes of incidents and demonstrated rapid detection, disciplined command, and truthful communications. Every drill produced a blameless postmortem with actionable owners and dates. Summit is operationally resilient—not just theoretically prepared.
