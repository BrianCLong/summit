                       Team,

                       We're excited to announce a strategic initiative to strengthen our engineering
                       governance, security, and operational excellence. This framework addresses our
                       critical priorities around #16721 (governance) and security initiatives #8443-#8439.

                       Over the next 6 months, we'll be implementing 14 comprehensive strategic documents
                       covering everything from security hardening to capacity planning.

                       What This Means for You:
                       - Clearer processes and procedures
                       - Better security and quality standards
                       - Improved team health and sustainability
                       - Reduced firefighting and reactive work

                       What We're Not Doing:
                       - This is not a blame initiative
                       - We're not replacing your expertise
                       - We're not adding busy-work bureaucracy
                       - We're not laying anyone off

                       Timeline: 6-month implementation (6 weeks planning, 16 weeks rollout, ongoing)

                       Next Steps: Town hall on [DATE] to discuss framework and answer questions.
