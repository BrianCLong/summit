# Data Lake Architecture

## Overview

A unified data lake integrates HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, and OSINT streams into a single platform that supports real‑time ingestion, petabyte‑scale storage, and secure query access. The design below combines stream processing, lakehouse storage, and a zero‑trust security model.

## Key Requirements

- **Streaming ingest**: millisecond‑latency ingestion from disparate sensors and reports.
- **Petabyte scale**: elastic storage and compute that grow independently.
- **Unified query layer**: SQL and graph access over structured and unstructured intelligence data.
- **Zero‑trust**: identity‑centric authentication, continuous authorization, and encrypted transport.

## Architecture Components

### Ingestion

- Edge collectors normalize HUMINT forms, SIGINT packet captures, GEOINT imagery, and OSINT feeds.
- Streams are published to a message bus (e.g., Kafka) with topic partitioning by source and classification level.
- Stream processors (Flink/Spark) apply enrichment, entity resolution, and schema validation before writing to the lake.

### Storage

- Object store (S3, GCS, or on‑prem Ceph) backed by an open table format such as Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake.
- Partitions by source type, collection time, and security marking enable efficient pruning and lifecycle policies.
- Raw and curated zones retain immutable originals and optimized query sets; replication ensures durability across regions.

### Query & Analytics

- SQL engines (Trino/Presto) and graph services expose federated views across modalities.
- Materialized views and vector indexes accelerate geospatial and semantic search workloads.
- Notebook and API access is brokered through an access gateway enforcing row/column level security.

### Governance & Observability

- Central catalog tracks schemas, lineage, and provenance for every ingest.
- Data quality rules and automated validation guard against malformed or malicious feeds.
- Audit logs stream to SIEM for behavioral analytics and compliance reporting.

### Zero‑Trust Enforcement

- Mutual TLS, short‑lived tokens (OIDC), and policy decision points on every request.
- Network micro‑segmentation isolates ingest, storage, and analytics planes.
- Attribute‑based access control ties queries to user roles, mission need, and data classification.
- End‑to‑end encryption and immutable audit trails satisfy regulatory and insider‑threat requirements.

## Scalability

- Kubernetes orchestrates stateless services and auto‑scales stream processors and query engines.
- Storage and compute separation allows independent scaling to petabytes and thousands of concurrent queries.
- Tiered caching (Redis/SSD) reduces latency for hot datasets.

## Real‑Time Flow Example

1. GEOINT satellite imagery arrives at an edge node and is chunked into tiles.
2. Tiles are streamed through Kafka where a Flink job extracts metadata and stores imagery in the raw zone.
3. Enriched metadata is written to the curated zone and indexed for geospatial queries.
4. Analysts execute SQL or graph queries through Trino; zero‑trust policies filter results based on clearance and need‑to‑know.

This architecture delivers a resilient, streaming‑capable data lake that unifies multiple intelligence disciplines while maintaining strict security boundaries.
