# Unified Assurance Graph Model

This document describes the data model for the Unified Assurance Graph, a queryable dataset that links together all the different pieces of the governance puzzle.

## 1. Overview

The Unified Assurance Graph is a directed graph consisting of entities and relationships. Entities represent the nodes in the graph, and relationships represent the edges.

## 2. Schema

The graph must validate against the [assurance_graph.schema.json](schemas/assurance/assurance_graph.schema.json).

## 3. Entities
