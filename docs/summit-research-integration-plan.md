# Summit Research Integration Plan

## Purpose
This plan operationalizes the insights from the comprehensive OSINT, graph analytics, and information-warfare research brief into Summit's product portfolio. It focuses on four product pillars—GraphAI, Maestro Conductor, Summit Analyst Workbench, and Governance & Trust—to ensure that new capabilities, analyst workflows, and compliance guardrails stay aligned with state-of-the-art practices.

## Guiding Principles
- **Graph-native first:** Prioritize investments that expand GraphAI's ability to reason over massive, heterogeneous graphs while preserving privacy for federated deployments.
- **Operator-centered OSINT automation:** Deliver tooling that reduces analyst cognitive load by blending crowdsourced inputs, multimodal collection, and automated enrichment.
- **Counter-influence resiliency:** Build transparent, auditable pipelines that expose coordinated manipulation, propaganda tactics, and influence campaign mechanics.
- **Responsible intelligence:** Embed ethical, legal, and policy safeguards directly into data access, analytics, and sharing pathways.

## Portfolio-wide Initiatives
1. **Graph Foundation Model Incubation (IOHunter-inspired)**
   - Spin up a research pod inside GraphAI to evaluate pretraining regimes for graph foundation models tailored to information-operations detection.
   - Define dataset acquisition, labeling, and continuous learning loops using Summit's provenance ledger and synthetic campaign generators.
   - Produce milestone demos that compare traditional GNN pipelines with GFM-augmented detection in Maestro Conductor simulations.
2. **Federated Graph Analytics Rollout**
   - Extend the Workcell Runtime to support privacy-preserving subgraph queries, leaning on federated computation research for edge deployments.
   - Implement policy-aware routing inside the Meta Orchestrator so sensitive OSINT nodes remain on-prem while aggregate analytics flow to shared graph layers.
   - Provide deployment blueprints for mixed cloud/on-prem clusters that leverage FPGA acceleration where economically viable.
3. **Multimodal OSINT Agent Framework**
   - Integrate COSINT-style entity-event-scene extraction into Summit's ingestion connectors, with configurable prompts for language, media type, and risk thresholds.
   - Add Research Studio-inspired collaborative canvases to the Analyst Workbench so crowdsourced volunteers can triage leads without exposing privileged data.
   - Enrich identity intelligence modules with systematic identity-related classification templates to improve profile linking and red-teaming of adversaries.
4. **Coordinated Influence Intelligence Suite**
   - Embed Identification–Imitation–Amplification heuristics and coordinated behavior detection signals into Summit's threat-scoring models.
   - Deliver analyst playbooks that map detected narratives to disinformation countermeasures (disclosure charters, rapid-response messaging, media literacy pushes).
   - Integrate cyber troop activity baselines and Disinformation 2.0 risk indicators into dashboards, highlighting acceleration due to generative AI.
5. **Ethics, Compliance, and Transparency Enhancements**
   - Update Governance & Trust modules with Just Intelligence guardrails (collection justification, proportionality checks, post-operation audits).
   - Add automation to flag algorithmic bias risks in mass surveillance-style analytics and require policy exceptions before activating high-risk playbooks.
   - Publish client-facing transparency reports referencing UN-aligned media literacy investments and NGO defensive toolkits.
