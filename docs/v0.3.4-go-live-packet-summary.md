## 🎯 Deployment Strategy

### Wave-Based Canary Deployment
1. **Canary 20%** - 60min bake time with p95/error gates
2. **Canary 50%** - 60min bake time with throughput/availability gates
3. **Production 100%** - Immediate with comprehensive validation

### Rollback Triggers (Automated)
- GraphQL p95 >350ms (30min) → Pause promotion
- Autonomy compensation >0.5% (24h) → Halt enactments
- SIEM delivery <95% (15min) → Failover + escalation
- PII violations >0 (1h) → Immediate security halt

## 📊 Success Metrics
