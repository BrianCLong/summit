# ACS Learner â€” Model Card

**Model Name:** Adaptive Counterintel Strategies Learner (ACS)  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Purpose:** To propose dynamic counterintelligence strategies (tariff adjustments, deception scheduling, sanction proposals) based on observed adversary tradecraft traces and system feedback.

---

## Data

- **Training Data:** Past run traces (CR-SP outputs), deception trigger logs, AFL signatures, policy outcomes
- **Features:** step tokens, cost, timing, tariff scores, deception flags
- **Labels / Objectives:** Minimize peak belief, minimize cost, maximize coverage

---

## Evaluation

- **Metrics:** Mean squared drift error, sanction precision, recall on adversary behaviors
- **Test splits:** Hold-out per-campaign splits
- **Baseline:** Static tariff schedule + rule-based deception

---

## Intended Use & Limitations

- **Intended:** Assist human-in-loop policy proposals, automated tariff updates under supervision
- **Not Intended:** Fully autonomous deployment without review

---

## Ethical & Safety Considerations

- **Adversarial robustness:** Model is retrained periodically with adversarial inputs
- **Overfit monitoring:** Alert when loss diverges or decisions deviate from policy
- **Transparency:** All suggested strategies are logged, flagged, and gateable

---

## Relationship to Other Modules

- Works in concert with **ATL**, **CR-SP**, **ADC**, and **HITL**
- Provides policy proposals to be ratified or rejected

---

## Versioning & Governance

- Each model release requires an approval PR + test suite
- Model binaries and training logs stored with cryptographic digest
- Model card must accompany any deployment
