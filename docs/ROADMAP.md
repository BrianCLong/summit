# Roadmap

**MVP (Day 0–30):** Neo4j + temporal/confidence; Streamlit; Wikipedia connector; GraphRAG prototype; ABAC baseline.

**Phase 2 (Day 31–90):** React UI; GraphQL gateway; additional connectors (Have I Been Pwned, Twitter/X, VirusTotal*); runbooks for Fraud, Disinfo, Dark Web; OTel mapper.

**Phase 3 (Day 91–180):** DFIR adapters; JanusGraph option; DP exports; blockchain anchoring; KYC/AML rulepacks.

## Future Enhancements / Research Areas

- **Entity & Edge Mapping:** Create explicit graph node types for botnet orchestration clusters, cognitive anchors, and sentiment drift vectors.
- **Temporal Cadence Modeling:** Encode “narrative burst” patterns from bot/troll amplification so you can identify not just what is spreading, but when influence spikes occur.
- **Cross-Domain Fusion:** Integrate these entities with HUMINT (SME X) and SIGINT (SME Y) data models to attribute influence ops to actors and campaigns with higher confidence.
- **Neuroadaptive Content Systems:** AI that dynamically adjusts influence messaging in real time based on biometric or behavioral feedback. This is moving from theory to early field trials. It will require provenance tracking at the message variant level in IntelGraph.
- **Autonomous Counter-PsyOps Agents:** AI agents designed to detect and flood influence channels with truth-saturated counter-narratives in seconds, not hours. In graph terms, that’s a “real-time narrative inoculation” layer with nodes for counter-message origins, reach, and effectiveness scoring.
