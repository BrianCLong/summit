# Multi-Agent AI Frameworks with Production-Ready Demos (2025)

This guide curates the most prominent open-source and developer-oriented multi-agent AI frameworks that provide hands-on demos, templates, or production examples as of 2025. It is designed to shorten the evaluation-to-deployment cycle for engineering teams that need auditable, orchestrated agent systems.

## Top Frameworks with Demo Resources

| Framework         | Key strengths                                                      | Demo/example availability                                  | Application areas                                                     | Reference |

| OpenAI Agents SDK | Official high-level orchestration for OpenAI agents                | API docs, starter code, workflow demos                     | Composable production agent flows                                     | [4]       |

## Demo and Learning Resources

- Framework maintainers aggregate free templates, executables, and production-caliber walkthroughs—including the widely shared "AI agent examples goldmine" and official gallery hubs for LangChain, LangGraph, and AutoGen.[5][1]
- Major AI conferences (AAMAS, AAAI, IJCAI) highlight accepted demos showcasing web-based chat teams, robotic process automation, and real-world multi-agent prototypes, giving practitioners vetted reference implementations.[7][8][9]
- Production-ready frameworks ship with monitoring dashboards and agent team samples (e.g., LangGraph via LangSmith, SuperAGI via its built-in UI), accelerating observability and compliance reviews.[3][4]

## Getting Started Checklist

1. Review each framework's documentation and demo galleries, starting with official templates or hosted notebooks to understand orchestration patterns.[1][4]
2. Stand up scalable tests by deploying LangGraph, SuperAGI, or similar orchestrators in Docker or cloud environments; they provide full workflow coordination and monitoring out of the box.[3]
3. Pull curated codebases—such as the "AI agent goldmine" collection—to remix proven chains, agent teams, and evaluation harnesses for your domain.[5]
