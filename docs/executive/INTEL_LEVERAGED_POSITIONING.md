# Intel-Leveraged Positioning (2026-01)

## 1. Executive Narrative: The "Post-Supply-Chain" Era

**Audience:** Board / CEO / CISO

> "The era of 'trust but verify' is dead. We are now in the era of 'Zero Trust, Infinite Proof'.
>
> In January 2026, we saw how fragile the software supply chain is against agentic threats—ransomware targeting model weights, and agents spoofing identities in the cloud. Traditional platforms are reacting with more logs.
>
> **Summit is different.** We anticipated this. We built the **Provenance Ledger** and **Conductor** not as features, but as the foundational bedrock. We don't just execute code; we cryptographically prove *why* it executed and *who* authorized it. While competitors patch vulnerabilities, Summit prevents the class of attack entirely by enforcing semantic integrity at the core. We are not just a platform; we are the **Governance Layer for the Agentic Economy**."

## 2. Regulator Narrative: Operationalizing Continuous Assurance

**Audience:** EU AI Act Auditors / NIST Assessors

> "Summit does not treat compliance as a reporting exercise. We treat it as a data stream.
>
> To meet the demands of the EU AI Act (Article X) and emerging US Executive Orders, Summit implements **Continuous Assurance**. Every agent decision is:
>
> 1. **Intercepted** by the `PolicyEngine` (OPA).
> 2. **Validated** for semantic drift by the `Conductor`.
> 3. **Recorded** immutably in the `ProvenanceLedger`.
>
> You don't need to ask us for a report. You can subscribe to the ledger and audit us in real-time. This is **Regulatory-Grade AI**."

## 3. Product Marketing Claims (Evidence-Backed)

**Audience:** Buyers (Security Engineering / GRC)

| Claim | The "Moat" (Evidence) | Competitor Weakness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Impossible to spoof agent identity"** | **Identity Trust Graph**: We track behavioral velocity, not just tokens. (See `docs/moats/threat-intel-derived-moats.md`) | Competitors rely on static IAM tokens which are easily stolen. |
| **"Proof of non-poisoned context"** | **Semantic Governance Gates**: We validate context drift pre-inference. | Competitors filter output *after* the damage is done. |
| **"Audit-ready in milliseconds"** | **Deterministic Agent Provenance**: One-click export of the full decision DAG. | Competitors require days of manual log correlation. |

## Strategic Alignment

This positioning leverages our "Governance-First" pivot (Strategy Brief, Oct 2025) and directly monetizes the "Trust" gap identified in the 2026 Threat Signal Map.
