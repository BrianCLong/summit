# Executive Brief: Threat Intelligence Update (2026-01-22)

**To:** Leadership Team
**From:** Jules (Security & Governance)
**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Subject:** Response to Critical n8n RCE and Emerging AI-DaaS Threats

## 1. Top Risks Surfaced

1.  **Supply Chain RCE (Critical):** A remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2026-21858) in **n8n** (workflow automation) exposes our CI/CD pipelines and API keys to unauthenticated attackers.
2.  **AI-DaaS Saturation (High):** Intelligence confirms a 450-700% projected increase in **AI-enabled Disinformation-as-a-Service (DaaS)**, specifically targeting market/economic signals.
3.  **Market Warfare:** Adversaries are expanding narrative operations from political to **economic domains** (Critical Minerals, Financial Markets).

## 2. Summit Coverage Status

| Threat | Current Coverage | Gap Identified |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **n8n RCE** | Standard Dependency Scan | **GAP**: Docker image versions in self-hosted setups were not explicitly gated. |
| **AI DaaS** | Semantic Analysis (Text) | **GAP**: Lack of behavioral detection for "High Velocity / Low Variance" (Synthetic) patterns. |
| **Market War** | Political Domain Only | **GAP**: Narrative Engine lacks "Economic" domain context and BEND framing. |

## 3. Immediate Actions Taken

*   **Secured Supply Chain:** Implemented a **Hard Block CI Gate** (`verify_n8n_safe.sh`) to prevent deployment of vulnerable n8n versions (< 1.121.0).
*   **Defined Detection Logic:** Created machine-readable detection rules for **Synthetic Amplification** (`DET-SYN-001`) and **n8n Exploitation** (`DET-RCE-001`).
*   **Updated Governance:** Formally registered **AI-DaaS** and **n8n RCE** in the `Risk Register` and updated the `Security Ledger`.

## 4. Residual Risk & Next Steps

*   **Residual Risk:** Credential compromise in existing n8n instances remains until manual rotation is verified (P0 Backlog Item).
*   **Next Step:** Engineering to implement the `Economic` domain expansion in Sprint N+7 to capture the emerging financial services market demand.

**Status:** **Controlled / Monitoring**
