# Systemic Information Risk Dashboard (Executive View)

## 1. Concept

The Systemic Information Risk Dashboard transforms "content moderation" into a Board-Level Risk Instrument. It aggregates granular detection signals into three high-level risk indexes that correlate with business performance and brand reputation.

## 2. Key Indicators (KPIs)

### 2.1. Brand Integrity Index (BII)

* **Definition:** Measures the purity of the brand's narrative space relative to adversarial contamination.
* **Formula:** $BII = 1 - (\frac{\sum (\text{Reach} \times \text{Severity})_{\text{Adversarial}}}{\sum \text{Total Reach}})$
* **Impact:** Predictive of stock price volatility during crisis events.

### 2.2. Trust Erosion Rate (TER)

* **Definition:** The speed at which core brand axioms are being successfully contested by coordinated swarms.
* **Metric:** Velocity of "High-Confidence Contradictions" against "Canonical Truths".
* **Alert Threshold:** > 5% weekly increase triggers "Crisis Room" protocols.

### 2.3. Regulatory Exposure Score (RES)

* **Definition:** Quantified liability based on unaddressed DSP/DSA violations.
* **Metric:** Count of `HighSeverity` artifacts persisting > 24h * avg. fine per violation.

## 3. Dashboard Sections

### A. The "Risk Weather Map"

* **Visual:** Heatmap of narrative clusters.
* **X-Axis:** Virality (Reach).
* **Y-Axis:** Toxicity/Harm.
* **Z-Axis (Color):** Artificiality (Swarm probability).
* **Action:** "One-Click Takedown" for high-risk red zones (Pre-authorized by governance policy).

### B. Attribution Leaderboard

* **Visual:** Table of top threat actors targeting the organization.
* **Columns:** Actor ID, Origin (State/Private), Attack Volume, Success Rate.

### C. Mitigation ROI

* **Visual:** Bar chart showing "Prevented Damage".
* **Metric:** Estimated ad-spend equivalent required to counter the disinformation *if it had not been stopped*.

## 4. Board-Ready Reporting

The system generates a weekly PDF "Risk Brief" containing:

* Executive Summary of top 3 thwarted campaigns.
* Trend line of BII over the last quarter.
* Audit log of all autonomous defensive actions taken.
