# Zero-Touch Compliance Regulatory Matrix

This matrix maps Summit + MC zero-touch controls to regulatory obligations. Each control includes how the engineered system satisfies and surpasses baseline requirements through automation, telemetry, and auditability.

## Legal Surpass Statements

- **GDPR**: Beyond Article 32, the engine enforces privacy-by-design with automated DPIA updates, ledger-backed evidence, and SLA-based remediation (<15 minutes) for encryption drift.
- **CCPA**: Automates DSAR logging, risk scoring, and financial exposure modeling to meet ยง1798.130, with configurable workflows for MC and Summit data stewards.
- **HIPAA**: Provides guardrails for access control (164.308) and audit controls (164.312) with verifiable runbooks to demonstrate due diligence.
- **PCI-DSS**: Ensures encryption (3.4), vulnerability management (6.3), and segmentation (1.2) with auto-remediation pipelines tied to patch SLAs.
- **FedRAMP**: Aligns with configuration management (CM-2), least privilege (AC-6), and audit logging (AU-2) by coupling policy enforcement with automated SSP evidence generation.
- **ISO 27001**: Maps to Annex A controls for asset management, operations, network security, and logging, with telemetry exported to Summit ISMS dashboards.

## Evidence Chain

The compliance runner ships machine-readable audit logs (`ops/compliance_zero_touch/artifacts/compliance_audit_report.json`) with:

- Adapter-level findings, remediation guidance, and references to regulatory clauses.
- Auto-patch actions and their estimated economic benefit + risk reduction.
- Human-in-the-loop routing metadata to legal, risk, and finance stakeholders.
- Validation metrics derived from open compliance test suites with pass/fail rates.

## Continuous Enforcement Lifecycle

1. **Auto-discovery** scans IaC, Kubernetes manifests, and runtime telemetry using adapters (OPA, Sentinel, Kyverno, homegrown).
2. **Auto-remediation** triggers targeted patch payloads and pipeline hooks.
3. **Human review** orchestrator provides context to close gaps requiring legal/business approval.
4. **Regulatory synchronization** updates the matrix above and exports audit evidence for external assessors.
5. **Feedback loop** recalibrates economic/risk/legal scoring after every run, enabling predictive compliance posture.
