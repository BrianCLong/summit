# NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Control Mapping

This document maps Summit's security controls to the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 security control families.

## AC - Access Control
*   **AC-2 (Account Management):** Automated via SCIM provisioning; quarterly access reviews automated by "Governance Agent".
*   **AC-3 (Access Enforcement):** Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) enforced by Open Policy Agent (OPA) at the API gateway level.
*   **AC-6 (Least Privilege):** Service accounts utilize AWS IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) to ensure minimal permission scoping.

## AU - Audit and Accountability
*   **AU-2 (Event Logging):** All API calls, database queries, and system changes generate structured audit logs.
*   **AU-3 (Content of Audit Records):** Logs include actor, timestamp, source IP, action, resource targeted, and justification (if applicable).
*   **AU-9 (Protection of Audit Information):** Logs are shipped instantly to a write-only bucket; cryptographic hashing ensures tamper evidence.

## SC - System and Communications Protection
*   **SC-8 (Transmission Confidentiality):** mTLS (Mutual TLS) used for all service-to-service communication (Istio Service Mesh).
*   **SC-28 (Protection of Information at Rest):** Database volumes encrypted with AES-256-GCM using FIPS-validated modules.

## SI - System and Information Integrity
*   **SI-2 (Flaw Remediation):** Automated patching via daily node rotation; container vulnerabilities scanned by Trivy/Clair in CI/CD pipeline.
*   **SI-4 (Information System Monitoring):** Real-time anomaly detection using "Sentinel" agent monitoring for behavioral deviations.
