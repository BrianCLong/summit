# Executive Narrative Memo — Summit Category Positioning

## What Summit is

Summit is an **evidence-governed intelligence analysis platform**. It provides a structured
workspace for assembling entities, relationships, and sources with immutable provenance. It
enforces governance through policy-as-code and keeps analysts in control of conclusions.

## What Summit is not

Summit is **not** a decision system, an autonomous execution platform, or a prescriptive AI. It does
not guarantee correctness, completeness, or outcomes. It does not replace human accountability.

## Why this positioning is honest, durable, and strategically sound

- **Honest:** It matches product behavior and audit evidence—no implied autonomy or guarantees.
- **Durable:** Governance and provenance remain valuable as the platform evolves post-GA.
- **Strategic:** Trust and reversibility differentiate Summit without over-claiming.

This narrative scales across sales, partnerships, and audits because it is **true by design**.
