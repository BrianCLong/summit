# Summit Product Narrative & Category Definition (Master)

## A. Category Articulation (Foundational)

### What category Summit is in

Summit is an **evidence-governed intelligence analysis platform** for assembling, tracing, and
reviewing analytic work across entities, relationships, and supporting sources.

- **Class of systems:** analysis workbench + governed graph intelligence platform.
- **Adjacent categories it overlaps with:**
  - Knowledge graph platforms
  - Investigative case management
  - Evidence management and provenance tracking
  - AI-augmented research copilots (as assistive tooling only)
- **Why existing labels are insufficient:**
  - “AI analyst” suggests autonomous conclusions; Summit does not decide.
  - “Decision intelligence” implies prescription and action; Summit does not execute.
  - “Automation platform” implies self-directed workflows; Summit is analyst-directed.

### What category Summit is **not** in

Summit is **not** in any category that implies autonomy, prescription, or guaranteed outcomes:

- Decision-making systems
- Autonomous execution platforms
- Prescriptive or authoritative AI
- Systems that guarantee correctness, completeness, or outcomes

Category clarity is a **risk control**: these exclusions are deliberate boundaries aligned with
product behavior, governance controls, and audit posture.

## B. Core Narrative Spine (Single Source of Truth)

1. **What problem exists in the world?**
   - Modern investigations span fragmented data, uncertain sources, and complex relationships.
     Teams need traceable, defensible analysis without amplifying risk.

2. **Why existing solutions fail or create new risk?**
   - Generic analytics tools lack provenance and auditability.
   - AI tools often over-claim, blur responsibility, or hide reasoning.
   - Decision automation reduces human agency and raises compliance risk.

3. **What Summit does differently (structural, not aspirational)?**
   - **Evidence-first:** every insight is tied to sources with immutable provenance.
   - **Governed workflows:** policy-as-code enforces constraints and review points.
   - **Human-in-control:** analysts own conclusions; Summit provides structure and traceability.
   - **Reversible analysis:** hypotheses can be revisited without losing history.

4. **What guarantees Summit is willing to stand behind?**
   - Evidence and lineage are preserved and auditable.
   - Governance rules are consistently enforced by policy-as-code.
   - User actions are attributable and reviewable.

5. **What Summit intentionally refuses to do?**
   - Make or recommend final decisions.
   - Execute actions or trigger real-world outcomes.
   - Present outputs as authoritative truth.

**Mapping to product behavior and UI contracts:**

- UI emphasizes sources, provenance, and analyst ownership of decisions.
- Governance controls surface constraints and required approvals.
- Graduation criteria reflect evidence-backed behavior, not aspirational claims.

## C. Competitive Framing (Non-Comparative by Default)

Summit is positioned around **trust, evidence, and reversibility** rather than feature checklists.
Key dimensions:

- **Governance:** policy-enforced, not post-hoc compliance.
- **Traceability:** evidence and lineage are first-class.
- **Human agency:** analysts remain accountable decision owners.
- **Reversibility:** hypotheses and findings can be challenged and re-evaluated.

Constraints are **strengths**: Summit trades speed-for-unchecked-automation to preserve
accountability and audit resilience.

## D. Narrative Evolution Rules

The narrative may evolve only when evidence supports it.

### Required conditions for change

- Observable product behavior supports the new claim.
- Governance and policy-as-code cover the claim end-to-end.
- Audit artifacts exist to substantiate the claim.

### Graduation events

- Graduation may update **scope** and **coverage** of claims, never the boundaries on
  autonomy or decision authority.

### Approval and accountability

- Narrative changes require approval from **product**, **governance**, and **engineering**.
- Changes must be documented and linked to evidence.

### Drift detection and correction

- Regular review of sales/demo language against guardrails.
- Any over-claim triggers remediation and policy update.

## E. Explicit Exclusions (Always True)

- Summit does **not** make decisions.
- Summit does **not** execute actions.
- Summit does **not** guarantee correctness or completeness.
- Summit does **not** replace human accountability.
