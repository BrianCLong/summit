# Summit Claims & Language Guardrails

This document defines **allowed**, **conditionally allowed**, and **disallowed** claims. It applies
across sales, demos, website, analyst briefings, and investor discussions.

---

## 1. Allowed Claims (Safe, Provable)

**Definition:** Statements fully supported by product behavior and audit evidence.

**Examples (approved):**

- “Summit preserves evidence lineage and analyst actions for audit.”
- “Summit applies policy-as-code to enforce governance controls.”
- “Summit helps analysts organize entities, relationships, and sources.”
- “Summit keeps analysts in control of conclusions.”

**Sales copy examples:**

- “Evidence-backed analysis with audit-ready provenance.”
- “Governed workflows for high-stakes investigations.”

**Demo language examples:**

- “Here you can see the sources attached to each claim.”
- “This policy check prevents unapproved data from entering the case.”

## 2. Conditionally Allowed Claims (Require Context)

**Definition:** Statements that are true only under explicit constraints.

**Requires context such as:**

- Scope limitations (data sources, model boundaries)
- Human review requirement
- Governance rules in force

**Examples (allowed with context):**

- “Summit improves analyst efficiency.”
  - **Context:** specific workflow baseline and measurement period.
- “Summit reduces compliance risk.”
  - **Context:** only through enforced policy-as-code and audit trails.
- “Summit accelerates time-to-insight.”
  - **Context:** for supported workflows with human review.

**Sales copy examples (with context):**

- “In workflows with enforced policy-as-code, teams report faster reviews.”

**Demo language examples (with context):**

- “This acceleration depends on the evidence ingestion pipeline being configured.”

## 3. Disallowed Claims (Never Permissible)

**Definition:** Statements implying autonomy, prescription, or guaranteed outcomes.

**Examples (forbidden):**

- “Summit makes decisions.”
- “Summit guarantees correctness or completeness.”
- “Summit autonomously executes actions.”
- “Summit replaces analyst judgment.”
- “Summit ensures compliance by itself.”

**Disallowed sales/marketing phrases:**

- “AI decision engine,” “autonomous analyst,” “self-optimizing outcomes.”

## 4. Guardrails by Channel

### Sales

  - Website homepage or hero messaging
