# Test Suite Deviations

The following tests are known to fail or are nondeterministic. They have been deferred to ensure a green Golden Path CI.

## Test Failures (Baseline)

No tests failed during the initial baseline run. The system is stable on the Golden Path.

## Notes

- **CI Strategy**: We are strictly enforcing Node 20 and pnpm.
- **Determinism**: The `Reproducible Build` job ensures build determinism.
