# Project: Bug Tracker â€” All Products

## Purpose

To provide a central place to track, triage, and resolve defects across all our products.

## Triage Process

1.  New bugs land in the `Intake` view.
2.  The on-call engineer reviews the bug, assigns `Severity`, `Impact`, and `Area`.
3.  If `Severity` is `S0`, the on-call engineer is paged immediately.
4.  Bugs are prioritized and assigned to the appropriate team/individual.

## SLA

*   **S0 (Critical)**: Resolution within 4 hours.
*   **S1 (High)**: Resolution within 2 business days.
*   **S2 (Medium)**: Resolution within 1 sprint.
*   **S3 (Low)**: Resolution is best-effort.
