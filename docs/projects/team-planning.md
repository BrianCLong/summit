# Project: Team Planning â€” Q4 2025

## Purpose

To manage our team's work on a sprint-by-sprint basis, plan upcoming iterations, and track our capacity.

## Ceremonies

*   **Sprint Planning**: Monday, 10 AM CST
*   **Daily Standup**: Tuesday-Friday, 10 AM CST
*   **Retro/Demo**: Friday, 3 PM CST

## Capacity Planning

Capacity is calculated based on the `Estimate` (story points) field for all items assigned to an individual in the current iteration. A view named "Capacity Plan" will highlight any team members who are over their allocated capacity.
