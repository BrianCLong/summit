# Project: Iterations â€” Core Platform

## Purpose

To plan our work in fixed-length sprints (iterations) and track progress towards sprint goals.

## Ceremonies

*   **Daily Standup**: Tuesday-Friday, 10 AM CST
*   **Backlog Grooming**: Wednesday, 2 PM CST
*   **Retro/Demo**: Friday, 3 PM CST

## Carryover Policy

At the end of a sprint, any incomplete items are automatically moved to the next sprint. A comment is added to the item to indicate why it was carried over (e.g., `blocked`, `under-estimated`).
