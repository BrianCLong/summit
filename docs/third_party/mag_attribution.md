# MAG Attribution

This module implements concepts from:
* **Moral Association Graph: A Cognitive Model for Automated Moral Inference (MAG)** (Ramezani & Xu, CogSci 2024).

It also references:
* **Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD)** / **eMFD** ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-020-01433-0)).
* **Small World of Words (SWOW)** ([Papers by Danielle Navarro](https://papers.djnavarro.net/2019_swow.pdf)).

This implementation is a clean-room re-derivation of the concepts described in the public papers. No code was copied from the original authors.
