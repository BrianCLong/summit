# Summit Strategic Prompt Pack: Next-Level (11–20)

**Mission context:** Summit is an enterprise AI orchestration and governance platform targeting regulated industries (financial services and healthcare) over the next 18 months. Use these prompts verbatim for fast scenario work. Modes refer to your internal reasoning styles; keep answers concise and action-oriented.

## 11. Campaign Tree & Coverage Map (Trust Erosion/IP Theft)
"In [JINX] mode, build a campaign tree for an adversary trying to erode trust in Summit's compliance automation and steal our orchestration IP. Show phases, branches, and decision points (e.g., credential phishing, supply chain compromise, narrative attacks). Then switch to defense: map each branch to controls (zero trust, SBOM enforcement, signed artifacts), telemetry (SIEM, code-integrity logs, user-behavior analytics), and governance (playbooks, approvals, red-team cadence), and highlight uncovered nodes."

## 12. 2×2 Scenario Grid with Signposts (Market & Regulation)
"In [JADE] mode, construct a 2×2 scenario grid for the enterprise AI orchestration market using two critical uncertainties: (X) regulator posture (strict vs. permissive) and (Y) buyer consolidation (platform bundles vs. point tools). Name each quadrant, describe it, and list 3–5 signposts and early warnings for each (e.g., EU AI Act timelines, major bank RFP language, M&A velocity). End with: which quadrant we’re implicitly betting on now, and how to hedge."

## 13. Game-Theoretic Payoff Matrix (Summit vs. Incumbent)
"In [JADE]/[JAVELIN] mode, model a simple game between Summit and the leading GRC incumbent. Define 2–3 strategies for each side (Summit: compliance-first wedge, open extensibility, premium managed service; Incumbent: bundle lock-in, price undercutting, standards capture). Build a qualitative payoff matrix, identify Nash-like equilibria, dominated strategies, and 1–2 mixed strategies that maximize our regret bounds."

## 14. Category Design & Narrative Spine (AI Orchestration)
"In [JAVELIN] + [JIGSAW] mode, design a category around enterprise AI orchestration & governance. Define: (1) the enemy/problem (shadow AI, audit gaps, agent sprawl), (2) the promised land (provable compliance + faster delivery), (3) the key insight (control plane + provenance as product), (4) our new rules (signed workflows, verifiable policies, composable guardrails), and (5) 3 narrative frames for product, sales, comms."

## 15. Coalition & Standards Play (Responsible AI)
"In [JURY] mode, design a coalition and standards strategy for responsible AI automation. Map key stakeholders (regulators, cloud providers, EDR/SIEM vendors, ISACs, enterprise CISOs), their incentives, and potential alliance structures. Propose 3–5 concrete standards or principles we should champion (e.g., attestable agent actions, SBOM for workflows, runbook provenance schema, continuous control validation) and why."

## 16. “What Could Kill Us?” Pre-Mortem (18-Month Horizon)
"In [JADE]/[JINX] mode, run a pre-mortem: assume in 18 months Summit failed. List 10 plausible failure modes (market, technical, org, legal, narrative). For each, specify leading indicators, how we’d detect it early (telemetry, sales signals, incident patterns), and one preventive design change we can make now."

## 17. Pricing/Packaging as Strategic Weapon (Enterprise Wedge)
"In [JAVELIN] mode, treat pricing and packaging as levers for strategic advantage in enterprise AI orchestration. Propose 3 contrasting schemes: (a) control-plane wedge (free policy core, paid attestations), (b) land-and-expand (workflow packs per domain with usage-based compute), (c) “tax on legacy behavior” (discounted migration for signed pipelines, premium for unsigned). Describe strategic effects, risks, and which competitors each harms/neutralizes."

## 18. Narrative Attack Map & Resilience Kit (Trust)
"In [JIGSAW] mode, assume hostile actors want to damage trust in Summit. Map 5–10 likely narrative attacks and how they’d spread (LinkedIn thought pieces, X threads, leaked screenshots). For each, draft: (1) our core counter-narrative, (2) pre-bunk framing, and (3) internal talking points for leadership and frontline staff."

## 19. Regulatory Futures & Compliance Capital (EU/US)
"In [JURY] mode, outline 3 regulatory futures for EU/US AI orchestration in finance/health. For each, explain: (1) our risk exposure (auditability, data residency), (2) opportunities to turn compliance into a moat (certified control plane, reference evidence kits), and (3) minimal capabilities/processes to build now to be “compliance ready” and signal leadership."

## 20. 30/60/90 Operationalization with Tripwires (Launch Readiness)
"You are DIRECTORATE J ∑. Take Summit’s launch plan for regulated enterprises and turn it into a 30/60/90 day plan. Include: (1) key workstreams (product hardening, reference controls, partner integrations, field playbooks), (2) owners and dependencies, (3) success metrics (signed control attestations, first regulated logo), and (4) explicit tripwires/stop criteria for each phase to pivot or rollback safely."
