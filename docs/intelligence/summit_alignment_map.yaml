signals:
  state_change_centric_collection:
    components:
      - IntelGraph
      - Agent Mesh
    status: Gap
    notes: Needs schema update to support state transitions as first-class entities.

  indirect_infrastructure_correlation:
    components:
      - IntelGraph
    status: Aligned
    notes: Supported by current graph relation models.

  short_horizon_burst_collection:
    components:
      - Agent Mesh
    status: Gap
    notes: Requires temporal orchestration logic in Agent Mesh.

  claim_lineage_tracking:
    components:
      - IntelGraph
      - Security Ledger
    status: Gap
    notes: Needs explicit Claim entity and Mutation relationships.

  context_dependent_trust_scoring:
    components:
      - IntelGraph
    status: Gap
    notes: Current scoring is likely global/static; needs context dimensions.

  revision_aware_validation:
    components:
      - IntelGraph
      - Evidence-ID Consistency Gate
    status: Aligned
    notes: Evidence ID system supports versioning, but validation logic needs update.

  provenance_enforcing_pipelines:
    components:
      - GA Evidence Bundle
      - Evidence-ID Consistency Gate
      - Graph-Sync-Validator
    status: Aligned
    notes: Strong alignment with current GA readiness goals.

  contradiction_surfacing:
    components:
      - IntelGraph
      - CI/CD Gates
    status: Gap
    notes: Tooling currently favors synthesis; needs "conflict" highlighting mode.

  role_segmented_automation:
    components:
      - Agent Mesh
    status: Aligned
    notes: Matches current agent architecture.

  inference_inflation:
    components:
      - CI/CD Gates
      - AGENTS.md
    status: Policy Gap
    notes: Needs explicit guardrails in agent prompts.

  automation_authority_bias:
    components:
      - AGENTS.md
    status: Policy Gap
    notes: Needs UI/Process friction to force human verification.

  explainability_as_obligation:
    components:
      - Security Ledger
      - GA Evidence Bundle
    status: Aligned
    notes: Core to Security Ledger value prop.
