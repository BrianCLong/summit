# IntelGraph Federal Break-Glass Emergency Procedures

## Overview

Break-glass procedures provide emergency access to IntelGraph Federal systems during critical incidents when normal authentication mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient. These procedures comply with FedRAMP High and DoD IL-4/5 security requirements.

## Authority & Governance

### Emergency Roles

- **Incident Commander**: Senior technical leader authorized to declare emergencies
- **Security Officer**: ISSO/ISSM with authority to approve break-glass access
- **System Administrator**: Technical personnel with emergency access capabilities
- **Auditor**: Independent reviewer of all break-glass activities

### Approval Chain

All break-glass activations require **minimum 2 approvers**:

1. Security Officer approval (mandatory)
2. One of: Incident Commander, Deputy ISSO, or designated alternate

## Emergency Activation

### Triggering Conditions

Break-glass access may only be activated for:

- Critical security incidents requiring immediate containment
- System failures preventing normal authentication/authorization
- Data breach response requiring forensic access
- Life-safety emergencies requiring system override
- Court orders or regulatory mandates requiring immediate access

### Activation Process

#### 1. Initial Declaration

```bash
# Incident Commander declares emergency
$ kubectl exec -n intelgraph conductor-federal-0 -- \
  curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "Critical security incident - unauthorized access detected",
    "initiator": "john.smith@agency.gov",
    "duration": 4,
    "approvers": ["security.officer@agency.gov", "deputy.isso@agency.gov"]
  }'
```

#### 2. Multi-Factor Approval

```bash
# Security Officer approval (mandatory)
$ kubectl exec -n intelgraph conductor-federal-0 -- \
  curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "breakglass-1694525400-xyz789",
    "approver": "security.officer@agency.gov",
    "approvalCode": "[HARDWARE_TOKEN_OTP]",
    "justification": "Confirmed critical incident requires emergency access"
  }'

# Second approver (Incident Commander or Deputy)
$ kubectl exec -n intelgraph conductor-federal-0 -- \
  curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "breakglass-1694525400-xyz789",
    "approver": "deputy.isso@agency.gov",
    "approvalCode": "[HARDWARE_TOKEN_OTP]",
    "justification": "Incident validated - authorizing emergency access"
  }'
```

## Emergency Access Procedures

### Database Access

```bash
# Emergency read-only database access
$ kubectl exec -n intelgraph postgres-federal-0 -- \
  psql -U breakglass_user -d intelgraph_federal \
  -c "SELECT incident_id, timestamp, details FROM security_incidents WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';"

# Record access in break-glass session
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass/record-action \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "breakglass-1694525400-xyz789",
    "action": "database_query",
    "details": {"query": "incident_data_review", "rows_accessed": 47},
    "justification": "Reviewing recent security incidents for threat assessment"
  }'
```

### System Configuration Override

```bash
# Emergency configuration changes
$ kubectl patch deployment conductor-federal \
  -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"conductor","env":[{"name":"EMERGENCY_MODE","value":"true"}]}]}}}}'

# Record configuration change
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass/record-action \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "breakglass-1694525400-xyz789",
    "action": "config_override",
    "details": {"component": "conductor", "change": "emergency_mode_enabled"},
    "justification": "Enabling emergency mode to bypass failing authentication service"
  }'
```

### Log Collection & Forensics

```bash
# Collect system logs for analysis
$ kubectl logs --since=1h -l app=conductor-federal > /tmp/emergency-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# Secure log export
$ gpg --encrypt --armor -r security-team@agency.gov /tmp/emergency-logs-*.log

# Record forensic collection
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass/record-action \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "breakglass-1694525400-xyz789",
    "action": "log_collection",
    "details": {"logs_collected": "conductor_logs", "time_range": "1h", "size_mb": 245},
    "justification": "Collecting logs for security incident forensic analysis"
  }'
```

## Session Management

### Monitor Active Sessions

```bash
# List all active break-glass sessions
$ kubectl exec -n intelgraph conductor-federal-0 -- \
  curl -s https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass/sessions | jq '.'
```

### Session Termination

```bash
# Early termination (if incident resolved)
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass/terminate \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "breakglass-1694525400-xyz789",
    "reason": "Incident resolved - normal operations restored"
  }'
```

### Automatic Expiration

- All sessions automatically expire after maximum duration (4 hours default)
- No extensions permitted - new approval required for continued access
- System locks down all emergency access at expiration

## Compliance & Audit

### Real-Time Logging

All break-glass activities are logged to:

- SIEM system (immediate alerts)
- WORM audit storage (S3 Object Lock)
- Federal audit trail (FedRAMP compliance)
- Local break-glass log file

### Required Documentation

For each break-glass session, maintain:

#### Incident Report Template

```

### Post-Incident Review

Within 24 hours of session termination:

1. **Technical Review**: System administrators analyze all actions taken
2. **Security Review**: ISSO validates compliance and appropriateness
3. **Process Review**: Identify improvements to procedures
4. **Documentation Update**: Revise procedures based on lessons learned

### Regulatory Reporting

Break-glass activations must be reported to:

- FedRAMP PMO (within 24 hours)
- Agency CISO (immediate notification)
- ATO sponsor (next business day)
- Congressional oversight (if required by incident severity)

## Recovery Procedures

### System Hardening Post-Emergency

```bash
# Reset all emergency overrides
$ kubectl patch deployment conductor-federal \
  -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"conductor","env":[{"name":"EMERGENCY_MODE","value":"false"}]}]}}}}'

# Rotate emergency access credentials
$ kubectl delete secret break-glass-credentials
$ kubectl create secret generic break-glass-credentials --from-file=...

# Verify all emergency access revoked
$ kubectl exec -n intelgraph conductor-federal-0 -- \
  curl -s https://localhost:8000/api/federal/break-glass/verify-lockdown
```

### Audit Trail Validation

```bash
# Generate complete audit report
$ kubectl exec -n intelgraph conductor-federal-0 -- \
  curl -s https://localhost:8000/api/federal/compliance-status | jq '.auditTrail[-50:]'

# Verify WORM storage integrity
$ aws s3api head-object \
  --bucket federal-audit-worm \
  --key "break-glass/2024/09/12/session-breakglass-1694525400-xyz789.json" \
  --query 'ObjectLockRetainUntilDate'
```
