# Maestro Conductor Generations-Beyond Integration Execution Plan

This playbook translates the canvas plan for IntelGraph Maestro Conductor (MC) into an end-to-end execution path. It walks each scope item in the source plan, identifies prerequisites, and describes the concrete integration work required to achieve an evidence-backed release slice.

## Phase 0 — Conductor Alignment & Guardrails

1. **Stakeholder Intake**
   - Run stakeholder readouts on the Conductor summary to confirm goal/non-goal alignment, org defaults, and regulated topology boundaries.
   - Capture sign-offs in the provenance ledger seed (manual entry acceptable for the first sprint).
2. **Constraint & Risk Register**
   - Translate constraint clauses (org defaults, regulated topologies, evidence-first operations) into initial Rego policies and document open gaps.
   - Stand up a living risk register (scope creep, drift, autonomy, cost, data gravity) with mitigation owners.
3. **Definition of Done Instrumentation**
   - Draft acceptance checkpoints that connect intent → backlog → design/ADR → code/tests → infra → release → observability trail into the ledger schema.
   - Define ABAC/OPA policy pack scaffolding, SLO monitors, cost guardrails, and evidence bundle format commitments.

## Phase 1 — Capability Domains Integration

For each capability domain, the steps below must be executed sequentially to maintain traceability and policy coherence.

### 1.1 Intent → Backlog (Product OS)

1. Compare MC capabilities against AI IDEs, VSM tools, RAG/agent platforms, governance stacks, and marketplaces using measurable KPIs.
2. Document differentiation proof points (policy-constrained workcells, integrated analytics, explainable retrieval, policy-as-code, signed plugins) and align marketing/product narratives.

## Execution Governance

- **Decision Readouts:** Maintain ADR cadence and publish decision digests after each major choice.
- **Operational Playbooks:** Draft and socialize runbooks for GraphQL latency, ingestion throughput, and model drift incidents.
- **Governance Dry Runs:** Conduct tabletop exercises with Security/Compliance to validate ABAC/OPA design and residency sharding before production cutover.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Schedule Conductor summary stakeholder workshop (within 5 business days).
2. Launch ADR drafts for policy reasoner, router, orchestrator, ledger, and marketplace.
3. Spin up code scaffolds for router, workcell orchestrator, policy reasoner, and provenance ledger to unblock P0 execution teams.
4. Initiate risk register and connect to FinOps alerting backlog.

This execution plan ensures every clause in the generations-beyond integration canvas is traceably implemented, governed by policy, and demonstrably ready for regulated IntelGraph deployments.
