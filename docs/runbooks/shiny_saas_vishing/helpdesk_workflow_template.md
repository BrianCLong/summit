# Helpdesk Verification Workflow Template

## Workflow: Identity Verification for High-Risk Requests
*This workflow is mandatory for all password resets, MFA device changes, and account recovery requests.*

### 1. Initial Request
- Record caller name, claimed employee ID, and department.
- DO NOT accept phone numbers or email addresses provided by the caller as verification.

### 2. Primary Verification (Out-of-Band Call-Back)
- Look up the employee in the official HR Directory.
- Inform the caller: "For security, I will now call your registered work phone number to verify this request."
- Hang up and call the registered number.
- If no answer, DO NOT proceed.

### 3. Secondary Verification (Video ID)
- Initiate a video call (e.g., Zoom, Teams, Google Meet).
- Ask the employee to hold their government-issued ID or employee badge to the camera.
- Compare with the photo in the HR/IT system.

### 4. Manager Approval (Optional but Recommended)
- Send a message to the employee's direct manager: "Employee [Name] is requesting an MFA change. Please confirm this is a legitimate request."
- Wait for explicit confirmation.

### 5. Fulfillment
- Only after all steps are successful, proceed with the requested change.
- Log all verification steps taken in the ticket.

### 6. Escalation (Exceptions)
- If the employee cannot be reached via their registered number, escalate to the Security Operations Center (SOC).
