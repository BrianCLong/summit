# Break-Glass Flow Runbook

This runbook details the procedure for a "break-glass" scenario, where emergency access to production systems is required outside of normal operational procedures. This process is designed to be highly secure, auditable, and used only in critical situations.

## 1. Purpose

To provide a controlled and auditable process for gaining emergency access to production systems when standard access mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to resolve a critical incident.

## 2. Scope

This runbook applies to all production systems and data within the CompanyOS platform.

## 3. Trigger Conditions

- Critical system outage or degradation that cannot be resolved through standard operational procedures.
- Security incident requiring immediate access to contain or remediate.
- Loss of standard administrative access.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander (IC):** Authorizes the break-glass procedure.
- **Break-Glass Operator (BGO):** Executes the break-glass procedure.
- **Security Officer (SO):** Oversees the process and conducts post-incident review.

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1. Authorization

1.  **IC declares break-glass:** The Incident Commander determines that a break-glass scenario is necessary and formally authorizes the procedure.
2.  **Record Justification:** The IC documents the justification for break-glass access, including the nature of the incident, expected impact, and why standard procedures are insufficient.

### 5.2. Access Provisioning

1.  **BGO retrieves credentials:** The BGO accesses pre-provisioned, highly restricted emergency credentials (e.g., from a hardware security module, encrypted vault, or physical safe).
    - **Example:** Retrieve a temporary AWS IAM access key for a dedicated break-glass role.
2.  **BGO logs in:** The BGO uses the emergency credentials to gain access to the necessary systems.
    - **Example:** `aws configure --profile break-glass` then `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile break-glass`.
3.  **BGO performs actions:** The BGO performs only the necessary actions to resolve the incident, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    - **All actions MUST be logged.**

### 5.3. Monitoring and Logging

1.  **Real-time Monitoring:** The SO (or designated monitoring personnel) actively monitors all activities performed by the BGO during the break-glass session.
    - **Tools:** AWS CloudTrail, Kubernetes audit logs, application logs (Loki), system metrics (Prometheus).
2.  **Session Recording:** If possible, the session should be recorded (e.g., SSH session recording, AWS Session Manager).

### 5.4. De-provisioning and Review

1.  **Incident Resolution:** Once the incident is resolved, the BGO immediately revokes the emergency credentials.
    - **Example:** Deactivate or delete the temporary AWS IAM access key.
2.  **Post-Incident Review:** The SO conducts a thorough review of the entire break-glass event, including:
    - Verification of authorization.
    - Review of all actions performed by the BGO.
    - Analysis of logs and session recordings.
    - Identification of any deviations from the procedure.
    - Assessment of whether the incident could have been resolved without break-glass access.
3.  **Report Generation:** A formal report is generated, summarizing the incident, actions taken, findings from the review, and any lessons learned.
4.  **Process Improvement:** Update this runbook and related procedures based on lessons learned.

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Least Privilege:** Break-glass credentials should have the absolute minimum permissions required.
- **Time-Bound:** Access should be temporary and automatically revoked after a defined period.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Emergency credentials should be protected by strong MFA.
- **Physical Security:** Physical access to emergency credentials (if applicable) must be highly secured.
- **Separation of Duties:** The IC, BGO, and SO roles should ideally be filled by different individuals.
