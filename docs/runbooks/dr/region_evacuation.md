# Region Evacuation Runbook

This runbook outlines the steps to evacuate the CompanyOS platform from one AWS region to another in a disaster recovery scenario.

## Prerequisites

*   A pre-provisioned disaster recovery (DR) environment in the target region.
*   Regular backups of RDS PostgreSQL and Neo4j (via Velero and S3 snapshots).
*   Terraform state files are stored remotely and accessible.
*   DNS records are managed by ExternalDNS or a similar system.

## Steps

1.  **Declare Disaster:** Confirm the primary region is unrecoverable or severely degraded.

2.  **Activate DR Environment (Terraform):**
    *   Navigate to your infrastructure-as-code repository.
    *   Switch to the DR branch or apply the DR-specific Terraform configuration for the target region.
    *   Ensure all necessary infrastructure (VPC, EKS, RDS, S3 buckets, etc.) is provisioned.
    ```bash
    terraform -chdir=infra/aws/dr-region init
    terraform -chdir=infra/aws/dr-region apply -var="region=<TARGET_REGION>" # Example
    ```

3.  **Restore Data (RDS PostgreSQL):**
    *   Identify the latest successful backup of your RDS instance.
    *   Restore the RDS instance to the DR region. This might involve cross-region snapshot copy and then restore, or using PITR if the primary is still partially accessible.
    *   Update the application configuration in the DR environment to point to the restored RDS endpoint.

4.  **Restore Data (Neo4j):**
    *   Identify the latest successful S3 snapshot of your Neo4j database.
    *   Restore Neo4j data to the newly provisioned Neo4j instance in the DR region.
    *   Update the application configuration in the DR environment to point to the restored Neo4j instance.

5.  **Restore Kubernetes Workloads (Velero):**
    *   Deploy Velero to the DR EKS cluster.
    *   Configure Velero to access the backup storage location (S3 bucket) in the DR region.
    *   Perform a restore of the Kubernetes applications.
    ```bash
    velero restore create <RESTORE_NAME> --from-backup <LATEST_BACKUP_NAME>
    ```

6.  **Update DNS Records:**
    *   Once applications are restored and healthy in the DR region, update DNS records to point to the new ingress controllers/load balancers in the DR region.
    *   If using ExternalDNS, ensure it's configured in the DR cluster and will reconcile the records.

7.  **Verify Functionality:**
    *   Perform comprehensive smoke tests and health checks on the deployed applications in the DR region.
    *   Validate data integrity and application functionality.

8.  **Post-Evacuation Actions:**
    *   Monitor the DR environment closely.
    *   Plan for re-establishing a DR strategy from the new primary region.
    *   Conduct a post-mortem analysis of the disaster.
