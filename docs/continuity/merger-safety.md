# Merger & Acquisition (M&A) Safety Checklist

Mergers and acquisitions represent a primary vector for institutional capture. This checklist is a mandatory component of any M&A due diligence process involving the Summit platform. Its purpose is to make Summit safe to acquire *without becoming unsafe*.

## Phase 1: Pre-Merger Constraint Audit

This audit must be completed and presented to the acquiring party before the merger is finalized.

| Category                | Checklist Item                                                                                                                              | Verification Method                                                                  | Status      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| **Purpose & Boundaries**  | Has the acquiring party reviewed and formally acknowledged the **Purpose Lock Charter** (`purpose-lock.md`)?                                  | Signed attestation from the acquiring entity's executive and legal teams.            | `[ ] Open`  |
|                         | Have all "Explicit Non-Purposes" been mapped to the acquiring entity's existing business lines to identify potential conflicts?             | Conflict-of-interest report generated by a neutral third party.                      | `[ ] Open`  |
| **Governance**          | Has the acquiring party reviewed and accepted the authority of the **Custodianship Register** (`custodianship.md`)?                            | Formal integration plan that preserves the authority and independence of the Council. | `[ ] Open`  |
| **Invariants**          | Has a full audit of the **Safety Invariants** (`SAFETY_INVARIANTS.md`) been conducted to prove they are currently being met?                 | Time-stamped report from the automated invariant verification system.                 | `[ ] Open`  |

## Phase 2: Post-Merge Invariant Enforcement & Re-Authorization

These actions must be completed within the first 90 days post-acquisition.

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Evidence Continuity**   | Have all data migration and system integration plans been audited to guarantee no loss of **provenance or evidence linkage** for existing data?      | Successful execution of a "dry run" migration, validated by the provenance-ledger service.    | `[ ] Open`  |
| **Authority Re-validation** | Has all system authority (as defined in the `Custodianship Register`) been formally re-authorized under the new corporate structure?                 | New authority grants recorded in the immutable ledger, per the `authority-transition.md` protocol. | `[ ] Open`  |
| **Drift Sentinel Baseline** | Has the **Drift Sentinel** (`semantic-drift.md`) been recalibrated and its baseline reset to prevent the M&A event itself from being misread as drift? | Custodian-approved recalibration report.                                                        | `[ ] Open`  |

## Immutable Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

The following items are structurally protected and cannot be changed as part of an M&A transaction:

1.  **The content of the Purpose Lock Charter.**
2.  **The requirement for all analytical claims to be traceable to source evidence.**
3.  **The existence and authority of an independent Custodianship Council.**

Any attempt to negotiate these items automatically voids the M&A safety clearance.
