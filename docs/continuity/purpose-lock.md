# Purpose Lock Charter

## Immutable Core Intent

Summit's primary purpose is to serve as an institutional substrate for intelligence analysis, prioritizing the integrity and explainability of information. It is designed to resist capture and maintain its core function across time, leadership changes, and external pressures.

## Explicit Non-Purposes

Summit will not be used for:

*   **Monetization schemes that weaken evidence standards.**
*   **Surveillance without explicit, auditable authorization.**
*   **Suppression of dissenting or unpopular viewpoints.**
*   **Manipulation of information for political or commercial gain.**

## Red-Line Constraints

The following constraints are immutable and may not be amended without a supermajority vote of the Custodianship Council:

*   **All analytical claims must be traceable to their source evidence.**
*   **The system must never generate or present information without clear provenance.**
*   **User privacy will be protected through technical and procedural controls.**
*   **The system's governance and decision-making processes will remain transparent.**

## Narrow Amendment Path

Amendments to this charter require a formal proposal, a public comment period, and a 2/3 majority vote of the Custodianship Council. This process is designed to be deliberate and to prevent silent mission creep.
