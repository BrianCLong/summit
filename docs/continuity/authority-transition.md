# Authority Transition Protocol

This protocol governs the transfer of authority within the Summit system, treating succession as a critical security event. Its purpose is to ensure continuity and prevent vulnerabilities during leadership transitions.

## Handoff Procedures

*   **Explicit Record of Transfer:** All transfers of authority must be documented in an immutable ledger, specifying the outgoing and incoming parties, the scope of authority being transferred, and the effective date.
*   **Two-Person Rule:** Critical authority transfers require sign-off from both the outgoing authority and a designated member of the Custodianship Council.

## Temporary Constraint Tightening

During a transition period, the following constraints will be automatically enforced:

*   **Elevated Review Requirements:** All major system changes will require an additional layer of approval.
*   **Reduced Administrative Privileges:** Temporary restrictions will be placed on high-level administrative functions.
*   **Increased Monitoring:** System activity will be subject to heightened monitoring and auditing.

## Post-Handoff Review

*   **30-Day Review Window:** A 30-day window will follow each authority transfer, during which all actions taken by the new authority will be subject to review by the Custodianship Council.
*   **Re-validation of Evidence:** Key system invariants and their supporting evidence must be re-validated by the new authority within 90 days of the transfer.
