# Enterprise Sales Operating Plan

## Purpose
This plan converts the nine epics into an executable enterprise sales program with explicit owners, cadences, deliverables, and measurable outcomes. All timelines assume Week 0 is plan adoption.

## Program Guardrails
- **Decision hygiene:** every opportunity must have next steps, a living MAP, and an exit criterion; unqualified pursuits are closed early.
- **Owner clarity:** a single accountable owner per account and artifact; supporting roles documented.
- **Evidence-first:** progress is measured by signed artifacts (MAPs, meeting notes, procurement approvals) and coverage metrics, not activity volume.
- **No spray-and-pray:** exec touch is reserved for Top-50 targets that meet ICP, ARR potential, and strategic value thresholds.

## Epic Execution
### Epic 1 — Target List & War Room
- **Outputs:** Top-50 ranked list, dossiers per account, assigned account general, win themes, stop-loss criteria, deal room template, coverage dashboard.

### Epic 2 — Executive Access Program
- **Outputs:** Exec sponsor matrix, outreach plan by channel (warm intros/events/board), standard 3-slide brief, office-hours calendar, C-level value hypothesis per account, exec reference roster.

### Epic 7 — Enterprise Deployment Readiness
- **Outputs:** SSO/SCIM/RBAC templates, audit logs, admin dashboards, change-management playbook (canary/rollback/release notes/status page), DR posture with RPO/RTO, data retention/deletion controls and DSAR support, SIEM/audit export packs, SLA tiers & support escalation paths, implementation runbooks, go-live readiness checklist, hypercare plan.
- **Cadence:** Readiness review before contracting; hypercare daily during first 14 days post go-live.
- **Metrics:** Time-to-go-live, incidents during hypercare, adoption vs success metrics, escalation response time.

### Epic 8 — Account Expansion & Renewal Lock
- **Outputs:** Account health scoring model, QBR cadence with evidence package, expansion triggers/playbooks, stickiness features backlog, champion network map, executive sponsor program, renewal motion at 120/90/60 with risk flags, controlled save offers, trust releases and reliability reports, success stories pipeline.
- **Cadence:** Monthly health scoring refresh; QBRs locked quarter-wide; renewal standups start 120 days out.
- **Metrics:** NRR per top account, renewal cycle time, expansion conversion, sponsor coverage.

### Epic 9 — RevOps & Discipline
- **Outputs:** Standardized stages & exit criteria, evidence-based forecasting rules, required next steps, deal risk scoring with alerts, dashboards (coverage/velocity/slippage/win rate), CRM hygiene validation, enablement library, ABM alignment for Top-50, internal cycle time SLAs, single source of pipeline truth, weekly operating cadence.
- **Cadence:** Weekly operating review (commit, blockers, learnings); stale deals auto-escalate or close; enablement refreshed monthly.
- **Metrics:** Forecast accuracy delta, stale deal reduction, legal/security SLA adherence, win rate uplift after enablement.

## RACI & Ownership
- **Account General (AE/owner):** accountable for MAP, champion health, stop-loss exit; consults RevOps for hygiene.
- **RevOps:** accountable for coverage dashboards, stage definitions, risk alerts; consults Legal/Security on SLAs.
- **Executive Sponsors:** accountable for exec touch quality and C-level value hypothesis sign-off.
- **Deal Desk & Legal/Security:** accountable for procurement packet, playbooks, SLAs, and fast-lane adherence.
- **Product/Eng:** accountable for technical win path assets, benchmarks, and deployment readiness kits.

## Operating Rhythm (Weeks 0–6)
- **Week 0:** Ratify ICP/ARR/strategic scoring model; seed Top-50; publish stop-loss rules; stand up deal-room template and dashboards.
- **Week 1:** Finalize exec brief template and sponsor matrix; release trust packet v1 and redline playbook; publish technical discovery checklist and POC template.
- **Week 2:** Launch weekly war-room and risk alerting; enable champion kit v1; start fast-lane procurement; open migration factory hours.
- **Week 3:** First CAC session; baseline health scoring; release performance benchmarks; ship go-live readiness checklist.
- **Week 4:** Enforce renewal 120-day trigger for eligible accounts; publish displacement guides for top competitors; add hypercare runbook.
- **Weeks 5–6:** Iterate based on metrics; prune pursuits failing stop-loss; lock QBR calendar; expand reference/customer story pipeline.

## Tooling & Tracking
- **Deal rooms:** structured folders with MAP, org chart, win themes, dossier, risk log, procurement checklist, and decision timeline.
- **Dashboards:** coverage (exec touches, champions, MAPs), risk alerts (no champion/MAP/inactivity), velocity (POC cycle time, legal/security SLA), competitive outcomes, renewal runway.
- **Instrumentation:** multi-threaded outreach tracking by persona; MAP milestones; procurement SLA timers; POC observability for time-to-first-value.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Exec bandwidth bottlenecks. **Mitigation:** reserve slots for Top-50 only; pre-brief with 3-slide deck and value hypothesis.
- **Risk:** Legal/security drag. **Mitigation:** fast-lane with pre-approved fallbacks and evidence pack; weekly SLA review.
- **Risk:** Champion attrition. **Mitigation:** champion network map, backup candidates, and quick-win delivery within 14 days.
- **Risk:** Competitive lock-in. **Mitigation:** lock-in neutralizers, migration factory, and time-boxed concessions tied to parity reports.
- **Risk:** Pipeline noise. **Mitigation:** strict exit criteria, stale deal auto-close, evidence-based forecasting.

## Forward-Looking Enhancements
- **Predictive coverage scoring:** ML model to predict win likelihood based on champion strength, exec touches, procurement SLA adherence, and POC metrics; use to prioritize resources.
- **Automated MAP copilot:** generate and update MAP milestones from CRM activity and meeting transcripts; alert owners on slipped dates.
- **Risk simulation:** Monte Carlo simulation on procurement/POC timelines to set buffers and improve forecast quality.
