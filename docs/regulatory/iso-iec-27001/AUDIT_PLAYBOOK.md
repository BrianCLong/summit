| "Show logging/monitoring controls" | `ga-graphai/packages/prov-ledger/README.md`, `artifacts/provenance/`                                            | Share ledger samples in requested window; explain integrity and immutability guarantees.               | ≤ 2 hours |
| "Show change management process"   | `.github/workflows/pr-quality-gate.yml`, `.husky/commit-msg`, `artifacts/regulatory/iso-iec-27001/ci-runs.json` | Provide CI run IDs, commit validation, and smoke outputs captured by export.                           | ≤ 2 hours |
| "Show access control and tenancy"  | `server/src/config.ts`, `tenancy/` docs, `docs/regulatory/PROFILES.md`                                          | Explain guardrails and residency/retention flags; provide snapshot JSON generated by export.           | ≤ 3 hours |

## Interview Preparation

- Emphasize control harmonization: SOC and ISO packs reuse the same enforcement code paths; profiles toggle stricter defaults without forking.
- Demonstrate drift detection and fail-closed behavior using the profile validation notes in `docs/regulatory/PROFILES.md`.
- For customer-responsibility areas (training, physical security), point to explicit declarations in `docs/regulatory/PROFILES.md` and the evidence bundle manifest.

## Process Discipline

- Only use the exported bundle plus static docs—no manual screenshots or ad-hoc runs.
- Record any missing artifacts in `artifacts/regulatory/iso-iec-27001/gaps.json` and include remediation ETA in responses.
