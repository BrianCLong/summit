## Time-Bounded Audit Logs

- The export script filters provenance, CI, and SARIF artifacts by timestamp using the provided `--from/--to` values to ensure auditors see only the requested window.
- Audit log gaps (if any) are noted in `artifacts/regulatory/soc2-type-ii/gaps.json` generated by the script.
