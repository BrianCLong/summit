# SOC 2 Type II Gap Analysis

This analysis identifies gaps against SOC 2 Type II requirements and documents mitigations or risk acceptance paths.

| Area                                                | Gap                                                                                                               | Mitigation / Plan                                                                                                                                                            | Status                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Immutable audit persistence                         | AUD-002 points to provenance ledger, but platform-wide append-only storage is not yet enabled for every service.  | Enable provenance ledger sink in all services and enforce append-only storage in `ga-graphai/packages/prov-ledger` rollout; add drift-check CI to ensure sinks stay enabled. | Open (tracked as GA blocker C2 in `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`). |
| Change management approvals                         | Formal evidence of change approval workflow is limited to CI signals; human approval records are not centralized. | Extend evidence export to include PR metadata and CODEOWNERS enforcement events; integrate with `agent-metrics.json` provenance.                                             | Mitigation planned (export script hooks).                      |
| Capacity testing evidence                           | Availability claims rely on smoke tests but lack periodic load/chaos reports.                                     | Add quarterly load test artifacts to evidence bundle and tag outputs in `EVIDENCE_BUNDLE.manifest.json`; schedule in `docs/regulatory/OPERATIONS.md`.                        | Planned.                                                       |
| Security incident response drills                   | Runbooks exist but drill evidence is ad hoc.                                                                      | Capture drill transcripts/logs and store under `evidence/drills/` with timestamps; include in evidence export window.                                                        | Planned.                                                       |
| Vendor management (SOC complementary user controls) | Customer/vendor responsibilities are referenced in governance docs but not explicitly marked in pack.             | Add shared responsibility statements to `docs/regulatory/PROFILES.md` and evidence index.                                                                                    | Planned.                                                       |

## Risk Acceptance

- Physical security controls remain out-of-scope for Summit-managed responsibilities; customers rely on cloud provider attestations (documented in `docs/regulatory/PROFILES.md`).
- Until the immutable audit sink is enforced platform-wide, we accept temporary reliance on CI logs + provenance service coverage, with a target closure date matching GA blocker C2.
