# Executive Trust & Credibility Memo

**To:** Summit Leadership Team
**From:** Customer Trust Systems Owner
**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Subject:** Transitioning from Assumed Trust to Managed Trust

### 1. The Strategic Shift
As Summit transitions to MVP-3-GA, we can no longer rely on early-adopter forgiveness. Trust is now our primary currency. To protect it, we have implemented a formal **Customer Trust System** that treats trust not as a feeling, but as a measurable, observable system property.

We are moving from "We think they trust us" to "We know exactly where trust is eroding."

### 2. How We Measure Trust
We have defined four immutable dimensions of trust for Summit:
1.  **Truth:** Does the product match the promise?
2.  **Reliability:** Is the system there when needed, and are we honest when it fails?
3.  **Governance:** Are boundaries respected and controls visible?
4.  **Transparency:** Is our communication clear and non-defensive?

We are now instrumenting "Trust Signals" across our support, observability, and product analytics stacks to track these dimensions in real-time.

### 3. Early Signals & Protection Mechanism
While our baseline is healthy, we are proactively monitoring for:
*   **Demo/Reality Gaps:** Ensuring sales demos do not outpace implemented reality.
*   **Silent Failures:** Prioritizing detection of bugs that customers find before we do.

We have established a **Closed-Loop Feedback System**:
*   Trust-related feedback is prioritized above generic feature requests.
*   A "Trust Health Dashboard" provides visibility into these metrics.
*   **Severe trust erosion triggers incident response**, not just a Jira ticket.

### 4. Conclusion
Trust is hard to gain and easy to lose. By operationalizing trust measurement, we ensure that as we scale, we remain credible, reliable, and transparent. We are now managing trust deliberately.
