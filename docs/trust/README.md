# Summit Trust Portal

Welcome to the Summit Trust Portal. This section provides a transparent, evidence-based overview of the security, reliability, and governance posture of the Summit platform.

Our goal is to provide verifiable claims, not marketing assertions. Every statement in this portal is grounded in auditable repository artifacts and automated checks.

## What is Verifiable?

The claims made in this portal are backed by:

*   **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline:** Automated checks that enforce quality, security, and governance gates on every change.
*   **Repository Artifacts:** Design documents, risk ledgers, and readiness assertions that are version-controlled alongside our code.
*   **Verification Commands:** Scripts and commands that can be run locally to reproduce our automated checks.

## Sections

*   **[Security Posture](./SECURITY_POSTURE.md):** An overview of our security gates, dependency scanning, and risk management processes.
*   **[Reliability and CI](./RELIABILITY_AND_CI.md):** A description of our continuous integration pipeline and how we ensure the stability of the platform.
*   **[Evidence and Verification](./EVIDENCE_AND_VERIFICATION.md):** Instructions on how to independently verify the claims made in this portal.
*   **[Incident Response](./INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md):** Our philosophy and approach to incident management.
*   **[Extensions and Boundaries](./EXTENSIONS_AND_BOUNDARIES.md):** A description of the platform's extension model and governance.
