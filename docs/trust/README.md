# Trust System Verification

This document is the **Single Point of Truth** for verifying the Summit Trust System. It aggregates verification commands across all domains (Security, Ops, Data, Risk).

## ⚡ Quick Verification (Fast Proof)

To verify the core trust assertions (readiness, SLOs, evidence):

```bash
# Verify the GA Readiness Assertion matches the codebase
grep "READY" docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md

# Verify SLO definitions exist
ls -l docs/performance/SLOS.md

# Verify Evidence Control Bundle schema
ls -l docs/ga/GA_CONTROL_EVIDENCE_BUNDLE.md
```

## 🔍 Domain Verification Map

| Domain | Key Document | Verification Command (Simulated) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Readiness** | [Readiness Assertion](../SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md) | `grep "FINAL" docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md` |
| **Security** | [Security Policy](../security/SECURITY.md) | `npm run security:check` |
| **Privacy** | [Privacy Policy](../risk/fairness-and-privacy.md) | `npm run verify:governance` |
| **Observability** | [Observability Standard](../observability/OBSERVABILITY_STANDARD.md) | `npm run verify:runtime` |
| **SLOs** | [SLO Catalog](../performance/SLOS.md) | `npm run verify:runtime` |
| **Risk** | [Risk Ledger](../risk/RISK_LEDGER.md) | `cat docs/risk/RISK_LEDGER.md` |
| **Compliance** | [Assurance Contract](../assurance/PUBLIC_ASSURANCE_MEMO.md) | `npm run verify:compliance` |

## 🛠️ Generating the Trust Dashboard

To generate the full trust dashboard (requires `npm` dependencies):

```bash
npm run dashboard:trust
```

*(Note: If the dashboard command is not available in your environment, refer to `docs/trust/public-dashboards.md` for the static view.)*

## 🚨 Incident & Emergency

If verification fails or a trust violation is detected:

1.  Consult [Incident Response](../ops/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md).
2.  Check [Known Issues](../ga/NON-CAPABILITIES.md).
3.  Contact the **Trust & Safety Team**.
