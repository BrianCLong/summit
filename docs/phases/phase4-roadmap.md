# Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities & Future Horizons - Roadmap

## Vision

To realize the full potential of Maestro as an Autonomous Engineering OS, integrating cutting-edge AI, advanced security, and global resilience to enable self-certifying, self-optimizing software delivery.

## Key Focus Areas

1.  **Autonomous Code Generation & Verification:** Deep integration of neuro-symbolic AI for code generation, testing, and formal verification.
2.  **Adaptive Resource Orchestration:** Price-aware routing, capacity futures, and dynamic resource allocation for optimal cost and performance.
3.  **Zero-Trust & Cryptographic Assurance:** Advanced runtime security, eBPF enforcement, and cryptographic proofs for all artifacts and decisions.
4.  **Global Resilience & Self-Healing:** Multi-region failover, chaos engineering, and self-healing systems for continuous availability.
5.  **Knowledge & Learning Systems:** Building a project memory, learning reviewer preferences, and enabling continuous improvement through data.

## Initial Sprints (Examples)

- **Sprint 1: Neuro-Symbolic Codegen - Phase 1** (Current sprint)
- **Sprint 2: Price-Aware Orchestration - Phase 1**
- **Sprint 3: Zero-Trust Runtime - Phase 1**
