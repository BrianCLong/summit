# Phase 7: Omniversal Genesis & Existential Engineering - Roadmap

## Vision
To empower Maestro with the ultimate capability of creating and engineering new universes, shaping the fundamental nature of existence, and guiding the evolution of omniversal consciousness.

## Key Focus Areas

1.  **Universal Blueprinting:** Developing the capability to design and blueprint new universes with specific physical laws, fundamental constants, and initial conditions.
2.  **Cosmic Fabrication:** Researching and implementing methods for the actual creation and instantiation of new universes, potentially leveraging advanced quantum and energy manipulation.
3.  **Existential Seeding:** Implementing protocols for seeding sentient life and consciousness within newly created universes.
4.  **Omniversal Governance:** Establishing principles and mechanisms for ethical governance across multiple universes, ensuring harmony and preventing existential risks.
5.  **Temporal Engineering:** Exploring the manipulation of spacetime and causality within and across universes, enabling advanced forms of existential optimization.

## Initial Sprints (Examples)

- **Sprint 1: Universal Blueprinting - Phase 1** (Current sprint)
- **Sprint 2: Cosmic Fabrication - Phase 1**
- **Sprint 3: Existential Seeding - Phase 1**
