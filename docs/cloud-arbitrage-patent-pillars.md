# Patentability Checklist: Multi-Cloud Arbitrage Orchestration

## 1. Novelty Pillars
- **Dynamic Incentive-Aware Routing:** Decision engine fuses carbon incentives, energy pricing, and regulatory penalties into a unified scoring model that continuously shifts workloads across providers.
- **Federated Spot + Reserved Hedging:** Hybrid hedging mechanism that dynamically blends spot, reserved, and serverless capacity while enforcing SLAs via adaptive kill-switches.
- **A/B Benchmark Harness:** Built-in harness that performs simultaneous head-to-head evaluation against third-party optimizers and feeds delta metrics into reinforcement loops.
- **Regulation-Constrained Optimization:** Policy layer that applies per-jurisdiction compliance filters (data residency, sovereignty) before dispatching arbitrage actions.

## 2. Non-Obviousness Indicators
- Cross-market arbitrage that simultaneously reasons over financial, energy, and carbon markets rather than optimizing each independently.
- Federated failover algorithm that maintains active-active posture across at least three hyperscalers plus colocation providers.
- Continuous calibration using live demand forecasts and baseline optimization outputs to avoid drift and ensure statistically valid uplift claims.

## 3. Utility Evidence
- Demonstrated 3â€“4% incremental savings uplift per workload category over industry-standard tools (see market case study).
- Carbon reduction telemetry (18% drop in weighted carbon intensity) tied directly to arbitrage decisions.
- Policy compliance ledger logs for every automated decision, streamlining audit readiness.

## 4. Prior Art Review Checklist
- Search terms: "multi cloud arbitrage", "energy aware workload routing", "cloud savings spot reserved hedging".
- Review existing patents from AWS, Google, Microsoft on cost optimization; document distinguishing features (incentive blending, baseline benchmarking).
- Analyze academic literature on carbon-aware scheduling (e.g., University of Michigan, Stanford) for differentiation.

## 5. Enablement & Documentation
- Maintain architecture diagrams showing data ingestion, scoring engine, enforcement controller.
- Provide SDK/CLI documentation for integration into FinOps workflows.
- Include reproducible test suites (Vitest) and sample logs for economic validation.

## 6. Claims Drafting Starters
1. **Claim 1:** A method for orchestrating cloud workloads comprising ingesting live financial, energy, demand, and regulatory data; scoring provider-region options; and executing workload placements that maximize performance under cost and compliance constraints.
2. **Claim 2:** The method of claim 1 wherein the system benchmarks recommendations against external optimizers and adjusts scoring weights based on observed net benefit.
3. **Claim 3:** The method of claim 1 wherein the scoring integrates carbon incentives and penalties into the cost function to enforce sustainability targets.

## 7. Commercialization Safeguards
- Document defensive publications covering specific heuristics to deter competitors from patenting minor variants.
- Establish contribution tracking for inventors and maintain signed disclosure forms.
- Sync IP strategy with partnership discussions to manage joint ownership clauses.
