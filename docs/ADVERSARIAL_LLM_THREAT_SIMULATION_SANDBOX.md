# Adversarial LLM Threat Simulation Sandbox

## Objective

Provide a controlled environment where security teams can safely explore how adversaries might leverage large language models. The sandbox lets defenders rehearse detection, response, and governance workflows without risking real systems.

## Capabilities

### Phishing & Social Engineering

- Generate multilingual phishing templates with realistic branding and voice cloning for attachments.
- Model victim personas and adapt tone, urgency, and cultural references to increase believability.
- Inject context from synthetic or anonymized data to craft highly targeted spear‑phishing campaigns.
- Schedule iterative campaigns to test awareness training and mail‑gateway resilience.

### Exploit Development & Obfuscation

- Produce proof‑of‑concept exploit scaffolding and payload droppers with configurable obfuscation layers.
- Experiment with code mutation, virtualization, and polymorphic packing to stress static and dynamic analysis tools.
- Simulate vulnerability discovery workflows, including patch diffing and exploit prototype generation.
- Track defensive signatures to evaluate coverage against evolving attack tooling.

### Influence & Disinformation Operations

- Coordinate multi‑agent chat narratives across social platforms and forums.
- Pivot messaging strategies in real time to counter fact‑checking or moderation interventions.
- Analyze amplification patterns, bot‑net behavior, and narrative propagation through synthetic social graphs.
- Inject counter‑narratives to train detection of subtle framing or emotional manipulation.

### Supply Chain & Lateral Movement Scenarios

- Model compromise of third‑party libraries, update channels, or CI/CD pipelines leading to downstream infections.
- Rehearse multi‑stage kill chains spanning initial access, privilege escalation, persistence, and exfiltration.
- Include cloud and on‑prem components with role‑based access simulation and secret rotation checks.

### Data Poisoning & Model Evasion

- Generate adversarial training data or prompt‑injection patterns to test model hardening techniques.
- Create evasive queries targeting content filters, jailbreak detectors, or policy classifiers.
- Simulate slow‑roll poisoning campaigns and measure model drift over time.

### Defensive Countermeasures

- Run blue‑team response drills using auto‑generated playbooks and kill‑switch triggers.
- Feed telemetry into SIEM/SOAR pipelines for automated triage and containment.
- Benchmark detection efficacy, time‑to‑response, and analyst workload.

## Architecture

- **Red‑Team LLMs with Safety Governors** – Configurable guardrails, rate limits, and prompt auditing.
- **Scenario Orchestrator** – Builds multi‑stage campaigns, tracks state, and replays scenarios deterministically.
- **Sandboxed Execution Pods** – Isolated containers capturing system calls, network traffic, and model outputs.
- **Telemetry & Analytics Pipeline** – Normalizes events, computes metrics, and exposes dashboards.
- **Integration Connectors** – Hooks into email gateways, ticketing systems, chat platforms, and endpoint agents.

## Operational Safeguards

- Synthetic or anonymized datasets only; no production credentials or live endpoints.
- Role‑based access control with mandatory logging and periodic review.
- Automatic kill‑switch for outputs breaching policy thresholds.
- Clear labeling of all content as simulated to prevent weaponization.

## Metrics & Reporting

- Coverage of the MITRE ATT&CK kill chain stages.
- Detection precision/recall for each simulated scenario.
- Time‑to‑detect and time‑to‑respond benchmarks.
- Executive summary reports with scenario severity and remediation notes.

## Integration & Extensibility

- REST and message‑queue APIs for custom scenario ingestion or telemetry export.
- Plugin architecture enabling additional LLMs, data sources, or defensive tools.
- Scripting hooks for CI pipelines to run regression scenarios on model or rule changes.

## User Roles & Workflow

- **Red‑Team Operators** – design and launch adversarial scenarios, tune model parameters, and submit threat hypotheses.
- **Blue‑Team Analysts** – monitor telemetry, validate alerts, and feed findings back into detection logic.
- **Scenario Review Board** – approves high‑risk simulations and oversees after‑action reporting.
- **System Administrators** – maintain infrastructure, enforce policy controls, and manage model updates.

### Scenario Lifecycle

1. **Design** – operators compose or import templates defining entry points, goals, and guardrails.
2. **Approval** – review board vets scenarios for legality, ethics, and resource impact.
3. **Execution** – orchestrator schedules campaigns in isolated pods while streaming telemetry.
4. **Analysis** – dashboards visualize outcomes and annotate detection gaps.
5. **Remediation** – teams update rules, signatures, or playbooks before archiving the run.

## Model Management & Auditability

- Central registry tracks model versions, training data lineage, and risk scores.
- Prompt/response pairs are hashed and stored for reproducible experiments.
- Differential tests compare outputs across models to surface drift or regression.
- Opt‑in human feedback loops refine safety governors over time.

## Deployment & Scalability

- Helm charts and Terraform modules provision sandbox clusters across cloud or on‑prem environments.
- Pod‑level resource quotas prevent runaway compute usage.
- Horizontal autoscaling reacts to queued scenarios or peak exercises.
- Cost dashboards estimate per‑scenario expenditure for budgeting.

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

- Multi‑tenant support to allow cross‑team exercises with strict data partitions.
- Integration with threat‑intelligence feeds to auto‑generate emerging attack scenarios.
- Federated learning hooks to share defensive improvements without exposing raw data.
- Gamified training modules that pit human analysts against adaptive LLM adversaries.

## Governance & Continuous Improvement

- Documented policies for approved use, audit trails, and data retention.
- Regular update cycles informed by threat‑intelligence feeds and post‑exercise reviews.
- Training modules for analysts and developers to stay current on adversarial ML trends.

## Value Proposition

- **Proactive Defense** – Identify gaps before real adversaries exploit them.
- **Training & Awareness** – Strengthen staff preparedness against AI‑enabled attacks.
- **Governance Insight** – Clarify the policy and technical controls needed for safe LLM deployment.
