# Adversarial LLM Threat Simulation Sandbox

## Purpose

Simulate how threat actors could use large language models for offensive operations and test your defenses against them.

### Simulated Scenarios

- Phishing email generation with realistic social engineering
- Code generation for exploit kits or obfuscation

### Deception & Counterintelligence

- Seed honey tokens, decoy credentials, and instrumented services to lure and study adversarial agents.
- Mirror real assets with canary artifacts that trigger telemetry when touched.
- Feed deceptive responses back into red‑team LLMs to waste adversary cycles or reveal TTPs.
