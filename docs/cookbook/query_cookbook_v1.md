# IntelGraph Query Cookbook v1 (PR-13)

- Shortest path between two entities
- Expand ego network with constraints
- Find potential coordination edges by co-tags
- Filter entities by sensitivity with ABAC headers
- Time-sliced queries with validFrom/validTo

Each recipe includes: purpose, headers (ABAC), GraphQL query, and expected shape.
