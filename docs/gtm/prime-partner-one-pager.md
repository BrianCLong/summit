# Better Together: Summit + [Prime/SI Partner]

**Reusable Graph + AI Substrate for Intel & Analytics Programs**

---

## The Challenge You Keep Solving

Every intel/analytics program requires the same foundational components:

- **Graph substrate** for entity-relationship modeling
- **Provenance layer** for chain-of-custody and audit
- **Policy enforcement** for classification, access control, and DLP
- **AI/ML orchestration** with guardrails and explainability
- **Analyst UX** (graph, timeline, map views)

Your teams rebuild these components program-by-program—driving cost, risk, and time-to-delivery.

## Summit: Your Reusable Substrate

Summit provides a **production-ready platform** that slots under your mission-specific solutions:

| Layer | What Summit Provides | What You Add |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Data Ingestion** | Connectors (STIX/TAXII, REST, documents, OSINT APIs) | Mission-specific sources, custom parsers |
| **Graph + Provenance** | Neo4j-backed graph with chain-of-custody | Domain ontology, relationship rules |
| **Policy/Governance** | ABAC/OPA, DLP, redaction, audit logs | Customer-specific policies, classification schemes |
| **AI Orchestration** | NL-to-Cypher, RAG, workflow automation | Mission prompts, domain models |
| **Analyst UX** | Graph + Timeline + Map workbench | Custom views, branding, workflow extensions |
| **Deployment** | Cloud, on-prem, air-gap patterns | Integration with customer infrastructure |

**Result:** Faster proposal wins, accelerated delivery, reduced technical risk.

## Discriminators for Your Pursuits

When your proposals need to demonstrate:

| RFP Requirement | Summit Answer |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "Explainable AI" | Policy-gated AI with provenance; every answer traceable to source |
| "Data Governance" | ABAC/OPA, DLP hooks, classification tagging, audit logs |
| "Audit & Compliance" | SBOM/SLSA, exportable chain-of-custody, FedRAMP path |
| "Deploy Anywhere" | K8s/Helm patterns for cloud, on-prem, air-gap |
| "Interoperability" | STIX/TAXII, GraphQL/REST APIs, open standards |
| "Analyst Productivity" | Tri-pane workbench, NL queries, saved playbooks |

## Partnership Model

### Option A: Referral Partner (Lightest Touch)
- You identify opportunities; we close and deliver
- **20% referral fee** on Year 1 TCV
- No delivery responsibility on your side

### Option B: Resell Partner
- You contract with customer; we deliver through you
- **10–25% margin** (based on volume and commitment)
- Joint delivery support available

### Option C: Co-Delivery / OEM
- Summit embedded in your solution stack
- Per-program or per-seat licensing
- Joint go-to-market on specific pursuits
- Training and enablement for your delivery teams

---

## Engagement Model

### 2-Week Technical Spike

**Objective:** Prove fit for a specific pursuit or program.

**Scope:**
- Discovery session with your capture/solution team
- Reference architecture aligned to pursuit requirements
- Demo environment with sample data
- Technical brief for proposal input

**Outcome:** Artifacts ready for proposal insertion; go/no-go on partnership for that pursuit.

**Investment:** $15,000–$25,000 (creditable to production if pursuit wins)

---

### Joint Pursuit Motion

**Phase 1: Capture Support**
- Technical discriminators language
- Architecture diagrams for proposals
- Compliance/security documentation
- Demo support for orals/tech evals

**Phase 2: Delivery (Post-Award)**
- Summit platform deployment
- Data source integration
- Training and enablement
- Ongoing platform support

---

## Target Pursuits (Where We Help You Win)

Summit is strongest on pursuits involving:

- **OSINT / All-Source Fusion** — unifying multiple intelligence feeds
- **Graph Analytics** — entity resolution, link analysis, pattern detection
- **AI/ML with Guardrails** — need for explainability and policy enforcement
- **Compliance-Heavy** — FedRAMP, CMMC, IL4/5, audit requirements
- **Analyst Modernization** — replacing legacy tools, reducing swivel-chair

**Example Agencies/Programs:**
- DHS I&A, CISA JCDC, FBI Cyber, USSOCOM J2, Service intel (A2/G2/N2)
- Intel community modernization programs
- State/local fusion centers
- Critical infrastructure security programs
