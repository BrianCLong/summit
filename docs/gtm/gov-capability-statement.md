## Core Capability

**Provenance-First Analyst Workbench with Policy-Gated AI**

Summit delivers a unified intelligence analysis platform that fuses OSINT and all-source data into a verifiable graph with timeline and map views. Analysts accelerate time-to-insight while maintaining full chain-of-custody, audit trails, and data-handling compliance.

## Differentiators

| Capability | What It Means for Your Mission |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Provenance & Audit** | Every fact traced to source; exportable chain-of-custody; stands up to oversight and FOIA |
| **Policy-Gated AI** | ABAC/OPA enforcement, DLP hooks, redaction modes; AI assists within guardrails—no black-box risk |
| **Tri-Pane Workbench** | Graph + Timeline + Map in one interface; reduces swivel-chair across tools |
| **NL-to-Cypher** | Natural-language queries against the graph; analysts ask questions, not write code |
| **Deploy Anywhere** | Cloud, on-prem, air-gapped; containerized (K8s/Helm); FedRAMP path |
| **Open & Interoperable** | STIX/TAXII, REST/GraphQL APIs, SDKs; connects to your existing ecosystem |

## Past Performance / References

| Customer | Mission Area | Period | Summary |
|----------|--------------|--------|---------|
| [Reference A - Details Pending] | OSINT Fusion | 2024–Present | Cut time-to-insight by 45%; full provenance on 98% of ingested items |
| [Reference B - Details Pending] | Threat Intel | 2024–Present | Consolidated 6 feeds into unified graph; reduced analyst duplication |

## Technical Environment

**Architecture:**
- Graph Database: Neo4j 5.x (cypher queries, provenance relationships)
- Relational: PostgreSQL 15+ (case metadata, audit, reporting)
- Cache/Queue: Redis, Kafka/Redpanda

- FedRAMP trajectory (High baseline path)

**Deployment Options:**
- GovCloud (AWS/Azure)
- On-premises (customer-managed or managed service)
- Air-gapped (fully disconnected operations)
