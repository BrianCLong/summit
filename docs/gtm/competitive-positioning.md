2. **Policy-Driven Architecture:** OPA-based governance built-in, not bolted-on
3. **Complete Provenance:** Every action has auditable proof (who, what, when, why, with what evidence)
4. **Self-Hostable:** True data sovereignty for regulated industries (Notion, Finna, Soom are SaaS-only)
5. **Graph-Native:** Neo4j knowledge graph enables semantic queries and entity linking

## Competitor Analysis

### 1. **Notion** (Most Direct Competitor)

**What They Do Well:**
- Ubiquitous adoption (94% of Forbes AI 50 use Notion)
- Incredibly flexible workspace (docs, wikis, databases)
- Beautiful UI/UX
- Viral bottom-up adoption
- Strong template ecosystem

**Where They Fall Short:**
- **No Pre-Built Agents:** You build your own automations (complex for non-technical users)
- **Weak Governance:** No built-in approval workflows or policy engine
- **No Provenance:** No audit trail for who changed what
- **SaaS-Only:** No self-hosted option for regulated industries
- **Shallow Graph:** Relational DB, not knowledge graph (limited entity linking)

**Summit's Advantage vs Notion:**
- **Pre-Built Agents:** Chief of Staff, COO, RevOps work out-of-the-box
- **Enterprise Governance:** ABAC policies, multi-stage approvals, audit trail
- **Self-Hostable:** Deploy in your VPC/on-prem
- **Knowledge Graph:** Semantic queries, entity linking, provenance

**When to Choose Summit Over Notion:**
- Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government)
- Need approval workflows and policy enforcement
- Want AI agents that do work, not just answer questions
- Require audit trail and provenance

---

### 2. **Finna** (Closest to Summit's Vision)

**What They Do Well:**
- "All-in-one with AI agent": docs, CRM, product mgmt, ATS
- Pre-connected modules
- AI agent for search and synthesis
- Modern, fast UI

**Where They Fall Short:**
- **SaaS-Only:** No self-hosted
- **Generic AI Agent:** Not specialized by role (no "AI COO" or "AI Chief of Staff")
- **Weak Policy Engine:** No OPA or ABAC
- **No Audit Trail:** Not built for compliance
- **Early Stage:** Limited integrations (Summit has 17+)

**Summit's Advantage vs Finna:**
- **Named Agent Archetypes:** COO, Chief of Staff, RevOps (vs generic assistant)
- **Self-Hostable:** For data sovereignty
- **Policy-Driven:** Every agent action evaluated by OPA
- **Audit Trail:** Complete provenance
- **More Integrations:** 17+ connectors vs Finna's handful

**When to Choose Summit Over Finna:**
- Need specialized agents (COO, RevOps, etc.) not just generic AI
- Require policy enforcement and compliance
- Want self-hosted or white-label deployment
- Need deep integrations with existing SaaS stack

---

### 3. **Dotwork** (Enterprise Focus)

**What They Do Well:**
- Enterprise-grade: SOC 2, SSO, RBAC
- Deep verticalization (strategy, portfolio, product ops)
- Operating ontology + knowledge graph
- Partner program (VARs, SIs, consultants)
- Reference architectures (SAFe, LeSS, etc.)

**Where They Fall Short:**
- **Sales-Led Only:** Hard to try before buying
- **Complex Setup:** Requires consulting engagement
- **No Pre-Built Agents:** You configure agents yourself
- **Narrow Use Cases:** Strategy/product/portfolio (not broad Company OS)

**Summit's Advantage vs Dotwork:**
- **Broader Platform:** Not just strategy/product (also ops, revenue, people)
- **Self-Service:** Deploy and use without consulting
- **Pre-Built Agents:** COO, Chief of Staff, RevOps ready to go

---

### 4. **Leapsome** (People Ops Specialist)

**What They Do Well:**
- Deep verticalization around People/HR
- Performance reviews, goals, feedback, surveys
- Analytics and benchmarking
- AI meeting assistant and copilot

**Where They Fall Short:**
- **Single Vertical:** People/HR only (not full Company OS)
- **SaaS-Only:** No self-hosted

- **No Governance:** No policy engine or approvals

**Summit's Advantage vs Soom:**
- **Full Company OS:** Beyond just project management
- **Multiple Agents:** COO, Chief of Staff, RevOps (not just one)

### 1. **Mid-Market Tech Companies (50-500 employees)**

**Decision Criteria:**
- Fast time-to-value
- Easy to adopt (bottom-up or top-down)
- Integrates with existing tools
- Grows with the company

**Top Competitors:** Notion, Finna

**Summit's Pitch:**
- "Notion with AI agents that actually do work (not just answer questions)"
- "Pre-built agents (COO, Chief of Staff, RevOps) = faster time-to-value than building your own"
- "17+ integrations = single pane of glass across all your tools"
- "Self-hostable when you need data sovereignty"

**Winning Factors:**
- Agent archetypes (vs generic AI)
- Knowledge graph (vs relational DB)
- Governance built-in (vs bolted-on)

---

### 2. **Regulated Industries (Finance, Healthcare, Government)**

**Decision Criteria:**
- Self-hostable (data sovereignty)
- SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP compliance
- Audit trail and provenance
- Policy enforcement

**Top Competitors:** Dotwork

**Summit's Pitch:**
- "Self-hosted Company OS with AI agents that respect your policies"
- "ABAC policy engine (OPA) built-in, not bolted-on"
- "Complete audit trail: every action has proof (who, what, when, why)"
- "Deploy in your VPC or on-prem"

**Winning Factors:**
- Self-hostable (vs SaaS-only)
- Policy-driven architecture
- Complete provenance
- Multi-level security (UNCLASSIFIED → SAP)

---

### 3. **Systems Integrators & Consulting Firms (White-Label)**

**Decision Criteria:**
- Multi-tenant architecture
- White-label branding
- Partner program and revenue share
- Extensibility (SDK, connectors, agents)

**Top Competitors:** Dotwork (has partner program), others don't

**Summit's Pitch:**
- "White-label Company OS you can sell to your clients"
- "Multi-tenant with database-level isolation"
- "Build custom agents, connectors, Operating Model Packs"
- "Revenue share or per-tenant pricing"

**Winning Factors:**
- White-label edition (vs SaaS-only)
- Extensibility (SDK for agents/connectors)
- Partner program
- Operating Model Packs (pre-built vertical solutions)

---

## Objection Handling

### "Notion already does this"
**Response:** Notion is a great workspace, but it's not AI-first or governance-first. Summit provides:
- **Pre-built AI agents** that automate operational work (not just answer questions)
- **Policy engine** for approvals and compliance (Notion has none)
- **Audit trail** for every action (Notion doesn't track provenance)
- **Self-hostable** for regulated industries (Notion is SaaS-only)

### "We don't need another tool"
**Response:** Summit isn't another tool—it's the **one tool that replaces many**. It connects your existing tools (Slack, GitHub, Jira, Salesforce, etc.) into a unified knowledge graph. You use Summit's Switchboard as your command center and reduce context switching by 75%.

### "AI agents are overhyped"
**Response:** We agree that generic AI chatbots are overhyped. Summit's agents are different:
- **Specialized by role:** AI COO (ops), AI Chief of Staff (leadership), AI RevOps (revenue)
- **Policy-aware:** Agents can't violate your policies (OPA enforcement)
- **Human-in-command:** Agents recommend, humans approve (not autonomous)
- **Provenance-first:** Every agent action has auditable proof

### "Too complex / requires engineering team"
**Response:** Summit is designed for **self-service**:
- **Pre-built agents** work out-of-box (no training required)
- **17+ connectors** install in minutes (no custom code)
- **One-click deployment** (Helm chart or Terraform)
- **Operating Model Packs** for common use cases (RevOps, People, Finance)

While internal/white-label deployments require infrastructure, Hosted SaaS (Q1 2026) will be zero-setup.

### "Notion is cheaper"
**Response:** Notion is cheaper upfront but more expensive long-term:
- **Notion:** $12-15/user/month = $1,800/month for 100 users
- **Summit Internal:** $50K/year = $4,166/month (includes unlimited users)
- **At 100+ users, Summit is cheaper** and includes governance, agents, audit trail

For regulated industries, self-hosted is **non-negotiable** (Notion doesn't offer it).
