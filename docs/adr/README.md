# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Summit/IntelGraph platform. We use ADRs to capture significant architectural decisions, their context, and their consequences.

## Lifecycle

ADRs follow this lifecycle:

1.  **Proposed**: The decision is under discussion.
2.  **Accepted**: The decision has been agreed upon and is being implemented.
3.  **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by a later ADR.
4.  **Rejected**: The decision was proposed but not accepted.
5.  **Deprecated**: The decision is no longer relevant.

## Naming Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially and have a short descriptive title:

`NNNN-title-of-the-decision.md`

Example: `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`

## Template

See `template.md` for the standard format.
