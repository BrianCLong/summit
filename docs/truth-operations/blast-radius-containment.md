# Blast-Radius Containment for Falsehoods

## Innovation Pillar 5

> **"Contain the Lie, Don't Chase It."**

## Executive Summary

When false information enters the system, the damage isn't just the false belief itself—it's every decision, action, and downstream conclusion built on that falsehood.

Traditional approaches try to **correct** false information.
Summit **contains** it.

Blast-radius containment prevents false information from cascading through decision chains, limits its propagation, and enables surgical remediation rather than system-wide rollback.

## The Cascade Problem

### How Falsehoods Propagate

```
False Claim: "Database server CPU at 95%"
    ↓
Decision 1: Scale up database cluster
    ↓
Decision 2: Delay planned maintenance (capacity needed)
    ↓
Decision 3: Adjust budget forecast (unexpected scaling cost)
    ↓
Decision 4: Re-prioritize engineering work (investigate DB perf)
    ↓
Action 1: Purchase additional servers
    ↓
Action 2: Defer other projects
    ↓
Communication: Customer notification about "performance improvements"
```

**Time of Discovery**: 4 hours later, original claim was false (monitoring bug)

**Damage**:
- 8 decisions made on false premise
- Real money spent on unnecessary capacity
- Engineering hours wasted
- Customer confusion from contradictory messages
- Delayed projects that actually needed attention

**Problem**: Falsehood cascaded through 8 decision layers before detection

## Containment Principles

### Principle 1: Isolation Over Correction

**Traditional**: Find falsehood → Correct it → Hope corrections propagate
**Summit**: Find falsehood → Freeze its downstream impact → Correct selectively

**Rationale**: Corrections propagate slower than lies. Containment is immediate.

### Principle 2: Quarantine, Don't Delete

**Traditional**: Retract false information
**Summit**: Mark as compromised, preserve for forensics

**Rationale**: Understanding how falsehoods entered the system prevents recurrence

### Principle 3: Impact Tracking Before Correction

**Traditional**: Correct the claim, assume systems recover
**Summit**: Map all decisions influenced by claim, force explicit re-evaluation

**Rationale**: Silent corrections hide the blast radius

### Principle 4: Fail-Safe Defaults

**Traditional**: Allow decisions until proven compromised
**Summit**: Quarantine decisions based on suspect information

**Rationale**: Containment bias favors safety over efficiency

## Decision Dependency Graph

Summit maintains a **real-time graph** of causal dependencies:

```

### Node Types

1. **Information Nodes**: Claims, observations, measurements
2. **Decision Nodes**: Choices made based on information
3. **Action Nodes**: Executed operations
4. **Resource Nodes**: Allocations, assignments
5. **Communication Nodes**: External messages, notifications

### Edge Attributes

- **Influence Weight**: How strongly information affected decision (0.0-1.0)
- **Timestamp**: When dependency was created
- **Confidence**: How certain the causal link is
- **Reversibility**: Can this decision/action be undone?
- **Criticality**: Impact level of the influenced node

---

## Containment Protocols

### Protocol 1: Immediate Freeze

**Trigger**: Information integrity score drops below threshold OR explicit compromise detected

**Action**:
```
1. Mark information node as COMPROMISED
2. Identify all downstream dependencies via graph traversal
3. FREEZE all pending decisions that depend on compromised information
   - Block execution
   - Notify operators
   - Require explicit override to proceed
4. FLAG all completed decisions for review
5. QUARANTINE all communications based on compromised information
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "compromised_information": "claim_12847",
  "detection_time": "2026-01-01T14:23:00Z",
  "blast_radius": {
    "pending_decisions": 3,
    "completed_decisions": 7,
    "executed_actions": 4,
    "external_communications": 2
  },
  "containment_status": "ACTIVE",
  "actions_taken": [
    "Froze decision_908, decision_912, decision_915",
    "Flagged completed decisions for re-evaluation",
    "Quarantined customer notification #4472",
    "Notified 3 operators for manual review"
  ]
}
```

### Protocol 2: Impact Assessment

**After containment**, systematically assess damage:

**For Each Influenced Decision**:
```
1. Determine influence weight
   - If weight < 0.3: Low influence, may not require action
   - If weight ≥ 0.3: Significant influence, requires review

2. Assess reversibility
   - If reversible: Prepare rollback
   - If irreversible: Assess damage, plan mitigation

3. Evaluate criticality
   - If critical: Immediate operator attention
   - If non-critical: Queue for review

4. Check for secondary dependencies
   - Identify decisions that depend on this decision
   - Recursive containment if necessary
```

### Protocol 3: Selective Re-evaluation

**Not all decisions require re-evaluation**:

```
FOR each influenced decision:
  IF (influence_weight < threshold)
     AND (decision_outcome appears correct despite false input)
  THEN
     LOG as "correct despite contamination"
     MARK as reviewed, no action needed
  ELSE
     REQUIRE explicit re-evaluation with corrected information
```

**Rationale**: Conserve operator attention for truly compromised decisions

### Protocol 4: Controlled Communication Rollback

**For external communications** based on false information:

```
1. IDENTIFY: Which communications were influenced
2. CLASSIFY urgency:
   - High: Actively harmful if left uncorrected (issue correction immediately)
   - Medium: Misleading but not immediately dangerous (correction within 24h)
   - Low: Incorrect but low impact (correction in next regular update)
3. DRAFT correction:
   - Acknowledge error
   - Provide corrected information
   - Explain impact (if any)
   - No need to over-apologize
4. REQUIRE approval before sending
5. TRACK correction delivery
```

## Blast Radius Metrics

### 1. Propagation Depth (PD)

**Measures**: How many decision layers were affected

```
PD = max(path_length from compromised_info to leaf_decision)
```

**Example**: False claim → 3 decisions → 2 actions = PD of 5

### 2. Cascade Width (CW)

**Measures**: How many parallel decisions were affected

```
CW = count(unique_decisions influenced by compromised_info)
```

### 3. Reversibility Index (RI)

**Measures**: What percentage of influenced decisions can be undone

```
RI = reversible_decisions / total_influenced_decisions
```

**Interpretation**:
- RI = 1.0: Full rollback possible
- RI = 0.5: Half the damage can be undone
- RI = 0.0: All decisions irreversible, only mitigation possible

### 4. Temporal Spread (TS)

**Measures**: Time between falsehood introduction and detection

```
TS = detection_time - introduction_time
```

**Significance**: Longer TS → larger blast radius (more time to propagate)

### 5. Containment Effectiveness (CE)

**Measures**: How quickly propagation was halted

```
CE = decisions_frozen / (decisions_frozen + decisions_executed_post_detection)
```

**Goal**: CE → 1.0 (perfect containment)

## Case Study: Containment vs. Correction

### Scenario: False Security Alert

**10:00**: Monitoring system reports "Critical: Unauthorized access detected in user database"
**10:05**: Security team begins response
- Decision 1: Isolate database
- Decision 2: Force password reset for all users
- Decision 3: Notify legal team (breach disclosure prep)
- Decision 4: Draft customer notification
- Action 1: Database isolated
- Action 2: Password reset initiated (5% complete)

**10:10**: Discovery: False positive (monitoring system bug)

### Response A: Traditional Correction

**10:10**: "Never mind, false alarm"
**10:11**: Attempt to stop password reset (85% already sent)
**10:12**: Database brought back online
**10:15**: Confusion about whether to proceed with legal/customer notification
**10:30**: Cleanup complete

**Damage**:
- 85% of users forced unnecessary password reset
- Customer trust impact (false alarm made public)
- Wasted legal team time
- Operator stress and confusion

### Response B: Summit Containment

**10:10**: Integrity scoring detects monitoring system anomaly
**10:10**: Automatic blast-radius containment activated

```
COMPROMISED: "Unauthorized access detected" (integrity: 0.21)

BLAST RADIUS:
  Pending Decisions:
    - decision_legal_notify: FROZEN
    - decision_customer_comms: FROZEN

  In-Progress Actions:
    - password_reset: PAUSED at 5% complete
    - database_isolation: FLAGGED for review (already complete)

  Influence Graph:
    alert → isolate_db (weight: 0.95, completed, reversible)
    alert → password_reset (weight: 0.90, paused, reversible)
    alert → legal_notify (weight: 0.80, frozen, prevented)
    alert → customer_comms (weight: 0.85, frozen, prevented)

CONTAINMENT ACTIONS:
  ✓ Froze 2 pending decisions
  ✓ Paused 1 in-progress action (95% prevented)
  ✓ Flagged 1 completed action for review
  ✓ Prevented 2 external communications
```

**10:11**: Operator review confirms false positive
**10:12**: Database de-isolation (was flagged for review, not assumed correct)
**10:13**: Password reset cancelled (only 5% affected, targeted communication to those users)
**10:14**: Legal notification frozen decision deleted (never happened)
**10:15**: Customer communication frozen decision deleted (never happened)

**Damage**:
- 5% of users forced password reset (contained at 5% vs. 85%)
- No external communications (prevented)
- Minimal operator confusion (clear containment status)

**Improvement**: 94% reduction in user impact, zero external communication leaks

---

## Containment Tiers

### Tier 1: Observation (Integrity 0.60-0.70)

**Action**: Elevated monitoring, no containment
```
- Increase logging
- Flag for operator awareness
- Continue normal operations
- Watch for additional integrity degradation
```

### Tier 2: Caution (Integrity 0.40-0.60)

**Action**: Soft containment
```
- Require human confirmation for high-impact decisions
- Flag downstream decisions as "based on uncertain information"
- Prevent automated escalation
- Prepare rollback procedures
```

### Tier 3: Containment (Integrity 0.20-0.40)

**Action**: Hard containment
```
- Freeze pending decisions
- Pause in-progress actions
- Flag completed decisions for review
- Prevent external communications
- Require explicit override to proceed
```

### Tier 4: Quarantine (Integrity <0.20)

**Action**: Maximum isolation
```
- Treat as actively adversarial
- Complete freeze of all dependencies
- Forensic investigation triggered
- Security team notification
- No overrides without dual authorization
```

## Remediation Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm Compromise

```
OPERATOR REVIEW:
  ☐ Verify information is actually false
  ☐ Identify root cause of compromise
  ☐ Assess whether this is isolated or systemic
  ☐ Determine if adversarial or accidental

If adversarial → ESCALATE to security operations
```

### Step 2: Prioritize Impact

```
FOR each influenced decision, ordered by:
  1. Criticality (highest first)
  2. Reversibility (irreversible first)
  3. Influence weight (highest first)

CATEGORIZE:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Requires immediate action
  🟡 HIGH: Requires action within 4 hours
  🟢 MEDIUM: Review within 24 hours
  ⚪ LOW: Review when convenient
```

### Step 3: Execute Remediation

```
FOR each impacted decision:

  IF reversible:
    OPTION 1: Full rollback
    OPTION 2: Partial rollback
    OPTION 3: No rollback (if outcome coincidentally correct)

  IF irreversible:
    ASSESS: What's the damage?
    MITIGATE: How can we reduce harm?
    LEARN: How do we prevent recurrence?

  REQUIRE: Explicit operator decision for each
```

### Step 4: Communication

```
IF external parties were affected:
  DRAFT correction/notification
  REQUIRE approval
  SEND correction
  TRACK acknowledgment

INTERNAL:
  NOTIFY teams affected by rollbacks
  EXPLAIN what happened, what's changing
  PROVIDE timeline for remediation
```

### Step 5: Post-Incident

```
FORENSIC ANALYSIS:
  - How did false information enter?
  - Why did integrity scoring catch it (or not catch it sooner)?
  - What can prevent recurrence?

UPDATE DEFENSES:
  - Tune integrity thresholds
  - Update behavioral baselines
  - Improve detection rules

DOCUMENT LESSONS:
  - Add to institutional knowledge
  - Train operators on pattern recognition
  - Update runbooks
```

## Integration with Other Pillars

### With Integrity Scoring
- Integrity thresholds determine containment tier
- Low integrity triggers automatic containment

### With Narrative Collision
- Competing narratives may reference same compromised facts
- Containment prevents false narratives from spreading

### With Temporal Truth
- Containment speed matters (faster = smaller blast radius)
- Time-pressured decisions may proceed despite contamination with elevated oversight

### With Authority Continuity
- Compromised authority sources trigger broader containment
- All decisions from suspect authority get containment review

---

## Advanced Features

### Predictive Containment

Machine learning predicts:
- Which decisions are likely influenced by suspect information (even without explicit dependency)
- Probable blast radius size based on information type
- Optimal containment tier given characteristics

### Automated Rollback

For specific decision types:
- Pre-approved rollback procedures
- Automated execution upon containment
- Human confirmation for high-stakes only

### Blast Radius Simulation

Before decisions:
- Model potential blast radius if information is later found false
- Factor into decision whether to wait for higher integrity
- Containment-aware decision making

---

## Success Metrics

Containment effectiveness:

- **Containment speed**: Time from detection to freeze
- **Blast radius reduction**: Prevented decisions vs. completed decisions
- **Reversibility rate**: % of influenced decisions successfully rolled back
- **Communication prevention**: External messages stopped before sending
- **Operator efficiency**: Time to full remediation

---

## Conclusion

Falsehoods are inevitable. Cascades are not.

The difference between a contained incident and a catastrophic failure is **how far the lie traveled** before being stopped.

Blast-radius containment transforms Summit from a system that **reacts to false information** into a system that **prevents its propagation**.

This is critical for:
- High-stakes decisions with irreversible consequences
- Complex systems with deep dependency chains
- Environments where adversaries weaponize information
- Organizations that cannot afford cascading failures

The question isn't whether false information will enter your system.
The question is whether it will be contained before it causes damage.
