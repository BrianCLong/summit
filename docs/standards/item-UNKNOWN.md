# Standards & Interop Mapping: item-UNKNOWN

## Import/Export Matrix

- Deferred pending ITEM excerpts.

## Non-goals

- No ITEM-specific adapters until claims and licenses are verified.

## Compatibility notes

- This bundle defines stable evidence formats and a manifest contract usable across items.

## Claim-safe statements

- The current bundle is a governance scaffold only; no ITEM-specific capabilities are implemented.
- Evidence artifacts are deterministic placeholders pending ITEM excerpts.
