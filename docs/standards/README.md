# IntelGraph System Standards

**The Unified Source of Truth for Engineering Excellence**

## Overview

This repository (`docs/standards/`) contains the authoritative specifications, standards, and protocols governing the IntelGraph ecosystem. These standards are enforced by the **Deep Spec Writer** (Jules) and are binding for all agents and human contributors.

## Standards Index

### 01 - Structural & Architecture
*   [**STD-001: System Taxonomy & Nomenclature**](./01-structural/STD-001-System-Taxonomy.md)
    *Defines directory structure, naming conventions, and architectural invariants.*

### 02 - Behavioral & Agentic
*   [**STD-002: Agentic Workflow & Governance**](./02-behavioral/STD-002-Agentic-Workflow.md)

## How to Use

1.  **For Agents**: Read `STD-001` and `STD-002` before starting any task to ensure compliance with naming and workflow rules.
2.  **For Humans**: Reference `STD-001` for code organization and `STD-003` for documentation requirements.
3.  **For Architects**: Use `STD-000` to draft new standards (RFCs) for system evolution.

## Governance

This repository is maintained by **Jules**.
To propose a change, submit a PR adding a new RFC or updating an existing Standard.
All Standards follow Semantic Versioning.
