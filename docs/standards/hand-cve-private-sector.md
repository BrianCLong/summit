# Vulnerability Resilience Standard: Multi-Source Intelligence

**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Jules (Release Captain)

**Date**: 2026-01-27

## 1. Overview
This standard defines Summit's approach to vulnerability intelligence, moving from a single-source (CVE/MITRE) dependency to a multi-source, evidence-backed, and resilient architecture.

## 2. Motivation
Structural delays and operational risks in the centralized CVE ecosystem require Summit to adopt a "don't block on CVE assignment" policy. We ingest from multiple sources (OSV, GHSA, vendor feeds) and use alias stitching to maintain a unified view.

## 3. Canonical Model: `VulnRecord`
All ingested vulnerability data must be normalized into the `VulnRecord` schema.

### 3.1 Key Fields
- `record_id`: Deterministic hash of stable inputs (e.g., source + source_id).
- `aliases`: Mapping of identifiers (CVE, GHSA, OSV).
- `provenance`: List of evidence records for each source used.
- `determinism`: Artifacts must be stable across runs (no wall-clock timestamps).

## 4. Ingestion Policy
- **Multi-source**: OSV.dev is the primary aggregator for open-source vulnerabilities.
- **Shadow Ingestion**: New feeds run in shadow mode (feature flagged) before graduating to primary status.
- **Drift Monitoring**: We track coverage gaps between sources (e.g., when OSV has a record but CVE ID is missing).

## 5. Security & Governance
- **Never-Log**: Vulnerability data must be scrubbed of sensitive environment details or tokens.
- **Evidence IDs**: Every normalization step must produce a signed evidence bundle.
