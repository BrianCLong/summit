# Systemic Information Risk Standard

**Standard:** Summit-SIR-v1

## 1. Philosophy
Misinformation is not a content problem; it is a **systemic risk** problem. We measure the *capacity for harm*, not just the harm itself.

## 2. The Systemic Risk Index (SRI)
The SRI is a composite metric (0-100) derived from:
1.  **Institutional Trust Erosion:** Sentiment velocity against core institutions.
2.  **Market Stability:** Volatility correlation with narrative spikes.
3.  **Social Cohesion:** Polarization metrics in graph topology.

## 3. Regulatory Alignment
This standard aligns with:
*   **EU AI Act (Article 9):** Risk management systems for high-risk AI.
*   **DSA (Articles 34-35):** Systemic risk assessment for VLOPs.

## 4. Usage
The SRI score dictates the platform's DEFCON level.
*   **SRI > 70:** Automated circuit breakers enabled.
*   **SRI < 30:** Normal operations.
