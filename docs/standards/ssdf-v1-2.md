# SSDF v1.2 Standard

## Overview
This standard defines how Summit aligns with NIST SP 800-218 Revision 1 (IPD) - Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.2.

## Mapping Approach
- We do not reproduce SSDF text verbatim.
- We map SSDF Practice/Task IDs to Summit Controls and Evidence.
- Mapping is maintained in `subsumption/ssdf-v1-2/mapping_registry.json`.

## Import/Export
- **Import:** We import Practice/Task IDs from NIST publications.
- **Export:** We generate a JSON registry and evidence index.

## Compatibility
- Based on v1.2 IPD (Initial Public Draft).
- Will evolve with final release.
