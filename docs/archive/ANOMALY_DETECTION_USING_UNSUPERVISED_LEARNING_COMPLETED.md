# Issue Closed: anomaly_detection_using_unsupervised_learning

This issue has been resolved and is now closed.

## Completion Details

- Integrated clustering-based models to surface outliers in graph activity.
- Wired detection service into data pipeline with automated scoring.

## Ongoing Enhancements

- Retrain models periodically as new behavioral data arrives using scheduled pipelines and drift detection.
- Improve model explainability to assist analyst review through feature importance and example-driven narratives.
- Evaluate anomaly scores against labeled datasets to benchmark precision and recall.

_Please provide more details and technical info._
