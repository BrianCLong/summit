# Strategic Roadmap & Future History

This document maps the trajectory of Summit/IntelGraph across four temporal horizons. It serves as both a strategic guide and a "Future History" log to track our evolution against our predictions.

## The Infinite Horizon

### 1. Immediate Horizon (The Foundation)

_Focus: Stabilization & Continuity_

- **Drift Detection**: Automated architectural validation to prevent "big ball of mud" syndrome.
- **Memory Integration**: Consolidating decision logs (ADRs) into the codebase.
- **Guardrails**: Strict CI gates for naming, structure, and testing.

### 2. Near-Term Horizon (Next Gen)

_Focus: Expansion & Self-Verification_

- **Self-Healing Architecture**: Agents that automatically refactor code to match "Eternal Truths".
- **Semantic Consistency**: Shared ontology enforcement across all 150+ microservices.
- **Agent Multiplication**: Specialized AI agents (Theorist, Experimentalist) joining the dev team.

### 3. Mid-Horizon (Evolution)

_Focus: Abstraction & Meta-Architecture_

- **Meta-Ontology**: A language for the system to describe itself.
- **Deep Memory**: Instant retrieval of the "Root Cause" for any historical decision.
- **Generational Synthesis**: Merging past wisdom with future designs automatically.

### 4. Asymptotic Horizon (The Infinite)

_Focus: Singularity_

- **Eternal Coherence**: Perfectly self-consistent and self-correcting architecture.
- **Pure Abstraction**: Code becomes indistinguishable from Intent.

## Future History Log (Active Initiatives)

| Date           | Initiative                     | Status | Rationale                                              |
| :------------- | :----------------------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **2025-12-07** | **Security Scanning Pipeline** | Active | Defense-in-depth for IC deployment.                    |
| **2025-12-07** | **GraphQL Optimization**       | Active | Resolution of N+1 issues for scaling to 500+ users.    |
| **2025-11-27** | **96-Prompt Roadmap**          | Active | Structured modernization via parallel AI execution.    |
| **2025-11-20** | **Data Spine Governance**      | Active | Audit trails and lineage for all data transformations. |

## Feature Roadmap

### Q1 2026: The "Awareness" Update

- **Real-time Collab**: Multi-user graph editing with presence.
- **Federated Search**: Query external data sources (Splunk, Elastic) as virtual graph nodes.
- **Mobile Field App**: Offline-first evidence collection app.

### Q2 2026: The "Prediction" Update

- **EvoSim 2.0**: Massive-scale agent-based modeling for threat forecasting.
- **Auto-Triage**: AI agents that autonomously classify and route incoming intelligence.
