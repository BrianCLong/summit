# Sprint 7 Completed: UX Refinement and Explainability

**Date:** September 27, 2025

Sprint 7 focused on polishing the user experience and adding transparency to AI-generated insights. The work centered on making results easier to understand, tracing model decisions, and tracking performance in production.

## Key Outcomes

- **Guided InsightPanel Flow** – `client/src/components/InsightPanel.jsx`
  - Step-by-step panels walk users through sentiment, link predictions, and summaries
  - Added keyboard navigation and accessible labels
- **Explainability Overlays** – `client/src/components/ai/ExplainabilityOverlay.jsx`
  - Highlights contributing nodes and edges on graph canvases
  - Configurable opacity and toggle for performance
- **Performance Tracing Hooks** – `server/src/middleware/perfTrace.ts`
  - Wraps GraphQL resolvers with timing and memory metrics
  - Emits traces to Grafana via OpenTelemetry exporter

## Definition of Done

- Overlays and navigation validated in the demo app
- Tracing data visible in Grafana dashboard
- Basic unit tests cover new components and middleware

The platform is now positioned for Sprint 8 to explore predictive simulations and collaborative review workflows.
