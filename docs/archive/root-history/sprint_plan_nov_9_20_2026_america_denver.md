# Sprint Plan — Nov 9–20, 2026 (America/Denver)

> **Sprint 24 — Continuous Improvement Engine:** “The OS improves itself” by turning CompanyOS onto Summit’s own operations. Close the telemetry→roadmap→policy loop with explainable evidence, proposal-first automation, and exec-ready observability.

---

## 1) Sprint Goal (SMART)

Prove that CompanyOS can run Summit’s own product and business decisions by Nov 20, 2026: ship telemetry-driven roadmap proposals with Decision Receipts, deliver proposal-first optimization pipelines with guardrails and receipts, and stand up exec operating dashboards + weekly export packs that demonstrate COGS reductions without SLO regressions.

**Key outcomes**

- ≥70% of roadmap proposals autogenerated from telemetry + customer signals with explainable evidence links.
- Automated optimization recommendations that demonstrate ≥10% COGS reduction vs baseline while holding SLOs (guardrails enforced).
- 100% of roadmap and optimization approvals emit Decision Receipts with provenance (who/why/evidence).
- Weekly exec ops review runs from Switchboard dashboards and “Exec Ops Pack” export; board-pack-lite ready.
- All self-optimizing actions remain proposal-first with approvals + rollback + verification.

---

## 2) Success Metrics & Verification

- **Roadmap automation:** ≥70% of proposals are engine-generated with evidence references. _Verify:_ Ranked list with evidence digests + generation log.
- **Cost/performance:** Optimization proposals estimate ≥10% COGS reduction with no SLO regression. _Verify:_ Simulation report + post-change telemetry comparing p95/p99 and burn-rate deltas.
- **Decision provenance:** 100% decisions produce signed Decision Receipts (who/why/what evidence). _Verify:_ Receipt registry query + sample export.
- **Org cadence:** Weekly exec ops review driven from Switchboard dashboards and exported Exec Ops Pack. _Verify:_ Dashboard snapshots + PDF export for the week.
- **Safety:** All auto proposals require approval; auto-reject when risk > threshold; rollback verified. _Verify:_ Guardrail logs + approval traces + rollback checklist.
- **Meta proof:** Before/after time-to-decision, cost savings, and prevented-incident proxies tracked. _Verify:_ Operating Effectiveness report draft with deltas.

## 3) Scope

**Must-have (commit):**

- **Signal ingestion (telemetry + CS + ecosystem):** Intake activation, churn risk, feature usage, incidents/SLO burn, COGS per unit, anomalies, QBR/lost-deal tags (manual import ok), adapter adoption/revenue; normalize into evidence digests.
- **Transparent prioritization model v1:** Score revenue impact, churn reduction, cost reduction, reliability risk, compliance unlock, effort band; output ranked roadmap list with “why” + evidence links.
- **Roadmap decision workflow:** Switchboard “Roadmap Review” (propose→debate→approve) emitting signed Decision Receipts and linking to evidence bundles.
- **Optimization recommendation engine:** Proposal-first actions (cache TTLs, pool moves, retention defaults, off-peak rollups, upsell vs overprovision) with expected cost impact, SLO risk estimate, rollback, approvals/dual-control.
- **Guardrails + simulation:** Policy preflight, cost/SLO impact estimate (staging replay when possible); auto-reject if risk threshold exceeded; attach simulation report to each proposal.
- **Execution pipeline:** Plan→approvals→execute→receipt→post-change verification via existing orchestrators.
- **Exec operating dashboard + export:** ARR pipeline (manual import ok), churn risk, uptime/SLOs, cost/margin, roadmap progress, security/compliance posture; generate weekly Exec Ops Pack PDF with evidence references.
- **Auditability + meta measurement:** Query decisions by period with evidence, approvers, changes; draft Operating Effectiveness Report (time-to-decision, cost savings, incidents prevented proxies).

**Stretch:**

- **Decision Receipt bundle exporter for investors:** One-click export of period decisions + evidence + guardrail outcomes.
- **Automated upsell assist:** Suggest add-on upsell vs overprovisioning when optimization proposal is blocked by risk guardrails.

## 6) Dependencies & Assumptions

- Telemetry sources available (product usage, reliability events, cost traces) with access to staging replay for SLO simulation.
- Manual imports acceptable for sales/CS and ARR pipeline data in v1.
- Policy guardrails configurable with thresholds and dual-control approvals.
- Provenance ledger/receipt service available for signing and querying decisions.
- Feature flags: `telemetryIngestV1`, `roadmapEngineV1`, `decisionReceipts`, `optRecoEngine`, `optSimGuardrails`, `execOpsDash`, `receiptExporter` (stretch), `upsellAssist` (stretch).

---

## 7) QA Plan

**Functional:**

- Generate ranked roadmap proposals with evidence links; verify ≥70% auto-generated.
- Run Roadmap Review workflow end-to-end and emit Decision Receipts with rationale + alternatives.
- Produce optimization proposals with cost impact, SLO risk, rollback; guardrail auto-reject on high risk.
- Attach simulation reports; verify post-change telemetry and rollback path.
- Execute approved proposals via orchestrator and confirm receipts + verification checks.
- Render exec dashboard tiles; generate weekly Exec Ops Pack PDF with evidence references.
- Query decisions by period; confirm Operating Effectiveness deltas captured.

**E2E demo:** Engine generates top 10 roadmap proposals → leadership approves 2 with receipts → optimization proposes retention tweak with simulation → approve → execute → cost drops while SLOs stable → Exec Ops Pack exported.

**Non-functional:**

- Guardrail thresholds prevent SLO regression; rollback verified.
- Evidence digests traceable to source telemetry; audit queries performant.

---

## 8) Risks & Mitigations

- **Data quality gaps** → manual imports + validation checks; fallbacks to human-entered evidence notes.
- **False-positive risk assessments** → use staging replay + conservative thresholds; require dual approvals.
- **Automation mistrust** → proposal-first with receipts + transparent scoring; publish “why” evidence.
- **Exec dashboard adoption** → ensure weekly export pack aligns to ops review agenda; dry-runs before demo.
- **COGS savings vs SLO tension** → guardrail auto-reject; rollback and verification baked into pipeline.
