# 90-Day War-Room Backlog

This backlog operationalizes the ruthless simplification campaign into a 90-day execution plan. It is sequenced in three 4-week phases (Weeks 1–4, 5–8, 9–12) and maps each epic item to an accountable owner role, acceptance criteria, and measurable "done" outcomes.

## Phase Roadmap

| Phase   | Weeks | Focus                                        | Objectives                                                                          |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | 1–4   | Cost + Safer Change + Deletions              | Cut burn, stabilize change control, accelerate removal of liabilities.              |
| Phase 2 | 5–8   | Speed + Data Correctness + Security Surface  | Reduce latency, enforce data truth, shrink attack surface.                          |
| Phase 3 | 9–12  | Trust Packaging + Governance + Consolidation | Turn reliability into customer trust, tighten decision speed, merge where it helps. |

## Operating Rituals

- **Deletion Week (monthly):** ship removals only, no net-new. Track removed code/flags/tables with telemetry proof.
- **Exception Governance:** Kill List feature work requires executive signoff; security exceptions tracked with expirations.
- **Measurement Cadence:** Weekly scorecard on cost, incidents, p95, deployment success rate, and roadmap burndown.
