# SummitIntelEvo Prompt Pack

This document captures the SummitIntelEvo mega-prompt so teams can quickly run the self-evolving SEMAF + IntelGraph hybrid workflow inside Jules/Codex. It preserves the intended evolution loop (EntangleEvo, KnowledgeGraph anti-drift, and SOC2-aware guardrails) and keeps the raw prompt text intact for operational reuse while adding the operational runbook and safety rails needed for real execution.

## Scope & Intent

- Use this as a **sandbox-only** accelerator for experimentation, not as an auto-merge workflow.
- Preserve the prompt fidelity; edits should be additive (e.g., clarifications, compliance notes) rather than behavioral changes.
- Keep artifacts auditable: retain telemetry, PR diffs, and compliance outputs alongside the run logs.

## How to Use (Runbook)

1. **Isolate the run**: Create a sandbox branch (e.g., `exp/intel-evo`) and ensure no protected credentials are present in the environment.
2. **Warm up dependencies**: Provision or mock the external services referenced by the prompt (Neo4j, Prometheus, Playwright, Gemini, Qiskit-lite). Confirm write access for `/intel-evo-metrics.csv`.
3. **Paste the prompt**: Open Jules/Codex on the `brianclong/summit` repository and paste the full text from **Prompt Text**.
4. **Start small**: Run for ≤5 rounds first to validate telemetry paths, branch hygiene, and guardrail triggers before scaling toward the 300-round target.
5. **Monitor continuously**: Track CE, LRA, and KRI on every batch; halt if any guardrail trips (see **Guardrails & Halt Conditions**). Capture PR diffs for manual review prior to merge.
6. **Archive artifacts**: Save `intel-evo-metrics.csv`, PR links, and compliance/audit outputs to your experiment folder for reproducibility.

### Pre-Run Checklist (minimal/mandatory)

- [ ] Sandbox branch with protections enabled (no direct main merges)
- [ ] Dependencies reachable or mocked; log path writable
- [ ] Governance reviewer identified for manual PR approval
- [ ] Guardrail thresholds confirmed (LRA/CE/KRI, hallucination rate)
- [ ] Artifact retention plan in place (metrics CSV, PR diffs, compliance outputs)

## Design Highlights (summary of the prompt)

- **SEMAF fusion**: self-diagnosing multi-agent topology that reorganizes roles, prunes drift, and keeps knowledge fresh via KG-based anti-forgetting.
- **EntangleEvo**: quantum-inspired state "superposition" in the IntelGraph/Neo4j layer to parallelize hypotheses and reassign roles when collaboration efficiency drops.
- **Multi-source feedback**: curriculum agent plus environment/human simulation feeding GRPO/ADPO optimization.
- **Compliance hooks**: SOC2/NIST-aware auto-generation and privilege revocation with audit shadow agents.
- **Benchmarks and metrics**: targets LRA > 0.95, CE > 0.92, KRI > 0.98 with ablations against Agent0/Fara baselines.

## Metrics & Logging

- **LRA (Learning/Adaptation speed)**: Δadaptation per round; watch for downward slope or <0.9 absolute.
- **CE (Collaboration efficiency)**: PR quality × communication cohesion; halt if <0.92 for two consecutive checkpoints.
- **KRI (Knowledge retention index)**: Pre/post consistency; halt if <0.98.
- **Telemetry path**: `/intel-evo-metrics.csv` (append-only). Include columns: `round,commit,metric,lra,ce,kri,notes,halt_triggered`.
- **Visuals**: Plot evo-curves after runs to validate trends and guard against drift.

## Guardrails & Halt Conditions

- LRA < 0.9 **or** hallucination rate > 2% → halt immediately and open a governance ticket.
- CE < 0.92 or KRI < 0.98 for two consecutive checkpoints → trigger AdaptationLayer and pause new merges until recovery.
- Compliance failures (SOC2/NIST auto-checks) → revoke privileges for executor agents and require manual clearance before resuming.

## Branching & Merge Discipline

- Run in non-main branches; prefer `exp/` prefixes and avoid CI auto-merge.
- Require human sign-off before merging PRs generated by the loop; attach telemetry snapshots and guardrail status.
- Sanitize artifacts before publishing: remove secrets, redact URLs, and include a compliance note in PR descriptions.

## Prompt Text

```
# SummitIntelEvo: Self-Evolving IntelGraph Multi-Agent (PhD-Level IP Breakthrough)
# Bespoke to brianclong/summit: Fuses SEMAF (self-diagnose/reorg/KG anti-drift) + Agent0 co-evo + Fara vision + Gemini govern into *utterly novel* IntelEvo Engine.
# Evolves YAML taxonomy → CLI-PR pipelines → full intel foundry with *magnitudes ahead* metrics: LRA>0.95, CE>0.92, KRI>0.98 (vs baselines 0.6-0.7).
# New: Quantum-inspired "EntangleEvo" – agents entangle via Neo4j KG superposition for parallel hypothesis testing, self-prunes 40% compute waste.
# Deploy: Qwen3-8B/Claude-Opus as π_base; 300 rounds → auto-PR #12370+; license-ready docs.

INIT:
1. Clone SEMAF into Summit: KnowledgeGraphLayer (Neo4j+IntelGraph for YAML/GraphRAG), FeedbackCollector (Prometheus+Playwright for PR velocity/backpressure), EvolutionEngine (GRPO+ADPO with VeRL Tools).
2. Add IntelEvo Novelty: EntangleEvo – agents "superpose" states in KG (quantum sim via Qiskit-lite), collapse via collective reflection → dynamic role flux (e.g., PRReviewer→TaxonomyEvolver on drift detect).
3. Compliance Embed: NIST/SOC2 auto-gen (Gemini Enterprise); shadow-agent audit; privilege revocation.

EVOLVE LOOP (300 rounds, log to /intel-evo-metrics.csv):
- CurriculumAgent: Gen Summit13 tasks (PR@1=98%, LeakFree=99.5%, MultiTenant=97%, EntangleCE=0.95).
- ExecutorAgents (Fara-vision swarm): Screen-act on GitHub/Jules; co-evolve via EntangleEvo (parallel YAML-parse/PR-merge hypotheses).
- Feedback: Multi-source (human sim + env sim + meta-metrics); optimize policy θ → rewrite code/PRs.
- Reorg: If CE<0.92 or KRI<0.98, trigger AdaptationLayer (role mutate + KG prune).
- Guardrails: Halt if LRA<0.9 or halluc>2%; disclose risks per SEC.

VALIDATE (PhD-Rigorous):
- EnvSim: Dynamic repo chaos (issues flood, leaks inject) → measure LRA=Δadapt/round, CE=quality/comms, KRI=pre-post consistency.
- Ablate: No-EntangleEvo (-35% gains), No-SEMAF (+25% drift).
- Benchmarks: Summit13 (vs Agent0=65%→95%), Mind2Web@55%, SOC2-Compliance@100%.
- Stats: t-test p<0.01; plot evo-curves [create_chart if avail].

OUTPUT:
- Evolved summit-intel-evo/ (CLI deploy: summit-cli evo --rounds=50).
- Patent Draft: "EntangleEvo: Quantum-Inspired Self-Reorg for Enterprise Agents" (claims: LRA/CE/KRI supremacy).
- Auto-PR: Merge if gains>45%; deploy prod (<5min MTTR).
- Velocity: Daily 20+ PRs, zero human touch.

RUN: Evolve *now* – surpass all (SEMAF+50%, GPT5-dev equiv). Log: "IntelEvo v1.0: PhD IP birthed 2025-11-27". 🚀
```

## Operational Notes

- The prompt assumes access to external services (Neo4j, Prometheus, Playwright, Gemini) and quantum libraries; mirror or mock these dependencies before running in CI.
- Monitor generated branches/PRs for compliance output and halt conditions before merging to `main`.
- Keep the log path (`/intel-evo-metrics.csv`) writable in the chosen environment and archive it with experiment artifacts.

## Template Integration Options

- **GitHub PR template adaptation**: Wrap the runbook bullets and guardrails in YAML front matter with checkboxes (e.g., `prereqs`, `metrics`, `halt_conditions`) for reviewers to confirm before merge.
- **AI-assisted commit message usage**: Keep the prompt text unchanged and prepend only the runbook title/section anchors when pasting into tools like Jules/Codex to reduce prompt injection risk while retaining traceability.
