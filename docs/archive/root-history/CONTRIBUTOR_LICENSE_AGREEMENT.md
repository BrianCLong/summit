# Topicality Summit Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
Version 1.0 (IntelGraph / Topicality Summit)

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights
granted by you to Topicality LLC, Topicality Summit, and Brian C. Long
(collectively, the "Licensor") for any Contributions you submit to any
Topicality Summit repositories or related projects (each, a "Project"). By
submitting a Contribution, you accept the terms below on behalf of yourself
and your organization (if applicable). If you are submitting on behalf of an
organization, you represent that you are authorized to bind that
organization.

## 1. Definitions
- **Contribution**: Any source code, object code, documentation, data,
  feedback, patches, designs, or other materials that you submit to a
  Project in any form.
- **Submit**: Any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
  to the Project or its maintainers, including but not limited to pull
  requests, patches, feature suggestions, issue comments, or emails.
- **You** (or **Your**): The individual or legal entity submitting the
  Contribution.

## 2. Copyright License Grant
You grant the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, make
available, and distribute your Contributions and any derivative works.

## 3. Patent License Grant
You grant the Licensor and its recipients a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to
make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer
your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone
or in combination with the Project to which it was submitted.

## 4. Moral Rights and Waiver
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you waive and agree not
to assert any moral rights in your Contributions, including rights of
attribution and integrity, against the Licensor and its recipients.

## 5. Source of Contributions
You represent and warrant that:
- Each Contribution is your original creation, or you otherwise have
  sufficient rights to grant the licenses above; and
- Your Contribution does not knowingly infringe or misappropriate any
  intellectual property or proprietary rights of a third party; and
- No Contribution contains confidential or export-controlled information,
  unless expressly agreed in writing by the Licensor.

## 6. Third-Party Works
If any part of your Contribution is based on, derived from, or includes
third-party works, you will clearly identify the source and license of those
works in your submission. You agree to follow any additional requirements
stated by the Licensor for incorporating third-party code or assets.

## 7. Certifications
By submitting a Contribution, you certify that:
- The Contribution was created in compliance with applicable laws, including
  export control and sanctions regimes;
- If you are an individual, you are legally entitled to grant the licenses
  above; and
- If you are acting on behalf of an organization, you have the authority to
  bind that organization, and the organization accepts the terms of this
  Agreement.

## 8. Support and Warranties
You provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" basis without warranties of any
kind. The Licensor is not obligated to provide support for your
Contributions or to include them in any Project.

## 9. Publicity
Except as required for standard attribution or license notices, neither
party will use the other's name, logos, or trademarks without prior written
permission.

## 10. Termination
This Agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated by written
notice. The licenses granted for Contributions already submitted survive any
termination. The Licensor may decline to accept or may remove any
Contribution at its discretion.

## 11. Entire Agreement
This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement
between you and the Licensor regarding Contributions to the Projects and
supersedes all prior proposals, understandings, and agreements, whether
oral or written, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
