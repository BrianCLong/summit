# Supported Request Scope

This project welcomes actionable engineering and documentation tasks that align with responsible, safe development practices.

## What You Can Ask For

- **Feature delivery**: Implement or extend product features within this repository's domains (backend services, frontend components, data pipelines, CI/CD tooling).
- **Quality improvements**: Refactors, performance tuning, accessibility fixes, reliability and resilience hardening, observability enhancements, and security best-practice alignments.
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, end-to-end, property-based, regression, and fixture updates that increase determinism and coverage.
- **Documentation**: README updates, runbooks, architectural notes, developer guides, API references, and onboarding checklists that improve clarity and maintainability.
- **Tooling and automation**: CI pipeline adjustments, linters/formatters, release automation, dependency hygiene, and developer experience improvements that preserve project safety.

## Boundaries and Non-Goals

- No requests for harmful, malicious, or unethical capabilities (e.g., malware tooling, unauthorized intrusion, or data exfiltration guidance).
- No instructions that bypass security controls, violate licenses, or encourage misuse of project assets.
- Avoid purely hypothetical mega-projects without repository alignment; keep requests scoped to achievable changes in this codebase.

## How to Get the Best Outcome

- Provide the target module or path, expected behavior, and acceptance criteria.
- Share any constraints (performance budgets, compatibility requirements, rollout plan) up front.
- Prefer incremental iterations: start with the smallest useful slice, then expand once validated.
