This PR resolves the server dependency bump conflicts by:

- Express: bump to ^5.1.0 while keeping existing body-parser (^2.2.0) for compatibility
- ESLint: adopt ^9.35.0 while retaining @typescript-eslint v8 and Jest v30
- Preserves prior OpenTelemetry versions

Scope is limited to server/package.json to keep risk low. Follow-up can address any necessary code changes for Express 5.
