Resolves the rebrand merge by pulling server branding and GA documentation from feature/rename-summit while deferring helm/infra/tooling to existing integration state.

Highlights

- server/src/app.ts and middleware/brandHeaders.ts from feature branch
- config/brand/brand.yaml and rebrand docs adopted
- helm/infra/policy/tooling kept as-is to reduce risk; to be handled in follow-ups

Validation

- Pre-push hooks passed locally; CI should run full suite on this PR.
