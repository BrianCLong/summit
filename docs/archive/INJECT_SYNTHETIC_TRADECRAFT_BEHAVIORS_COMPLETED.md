# Issue Closed: inject_synthetic_tradecraft_behaviors

This issue has been resolved and is now closed.

## Summary

Created mechanisms to inject synthetic tradecraft behaviors into datasets for training and detection experimentation.

## Implementation Details

- Built a library of synthetic behavior patterns modeled after real adversaries.
- Added tooling to insert behaviors into streaming and batch data flows.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate detection pipelines using the injected synthetic behaviors.
- Refine behavior patterns to closer mirror evolving adversary tactics.
- Share performance reports with the detection team for tuning.
