# Issue Closed: cross_domain_adversary_simulation_cognitive_twins

This issue has been resolved and is now closed.

## Summary

Established cognitive twin adversary models that simulate crossâ€‘domain attack strategies for training and analysis.

## Implementation Details

- Generated twin profiles based on historical adversary behaviors.
- Linked simulation outputs into existing threat intelligence workflows.

## Next Steps

- Incorporate latest threat intelligence feeds to update twin behaviors.
- Calibrate model parameters using feedback from simulated exercises.
- Extend simulations to cover additional domains and multi-vector attacks.
