# Sprint 6 Completed: AI Insight Enrichment

**Date:** August 16, 2025

Sprint 6 delivered the first iteration of the platform's AI Insight Enrichment features.
The sprint focused on transforming raw graph data into actionable knowledge through
link prediction, sentiment analysis, and insight summarization.

## Key Outcomes

- **PyTorch GNN Link Predictor** – `ml/models/predictive_links.py`
  - Graph convolution layers for relationship scoring
  - Confidence scores returned with each predicted edge
- **HuggingFace Sentiment Analysis** – `python/nlp/sentiment.py`
  - Transformer pipeline to evaluate notes, comments and descriptions
  - Graceful fallback when model dependencies are missing
- **InsightPanel React Component** – `client/src/components/InsightPanel.jsx`
  - Displays sentiment results, predicted links and AI summaries
  - Redux integration with loading and error states
- **AI API Endpoints** – `server/src/routes/ai.ts`
  - `/api/ai/predict-links`, `/api/ai/analyze-sentiment`, `/api/ai/generate-summary`
  - `/api/ai/models/status` for model health checks
- **Grafana Resolver Dashboard** – `server/grafana/graphql-resolver-performance.json`
  - Tracks resolver latencies, call rates and error counts

## Definition of Done

- Endpoints validated with request/response schemas
- Components rendered in the demo application
- Basic unit tests and logging in place

The platform is now positioned for Sprint 7, which will refine user experience,
explainability overlays and performance monitoring.
