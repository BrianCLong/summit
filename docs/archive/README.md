# Archived Documentation

This directory stores historical proposals, completed feature reports, and other
documents that previously lived at the repository root. They remain available
for reference but are **not** part of the active documentation set and may be
out of date.

## Usage

- Move retired or superseded markdown files here instead of deleting them.
- Keep filenames descriptive; the commit history provides additional context.
- Do not edit archived files except to correct broken links or formatting.

Active guides and onboarding materials live in the parent `docs/` directory.
Refer to `docs/README.md` for the current documentation index.
