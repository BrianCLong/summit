# GA-AdminSec Architecture

This document provides a high level overview of the GA-AdminSec vertical slice. It covers the IAM, policy engine, secrets vault, licensing, and compliance reporting components.

```
[Tenant/User] -> [Auth Service (OIDC)] -> [Gateway] -> [Policy Service] -> [Resource]
                                    \-> [Vault]
                                    \-> [Compliance]
```

## Components

### Auth Service

- Stub OIDC provider implementing the Authorization Code + PKCE flow.
- Issues JWTs signed with per-tenant RSA keys.

### Policy Service

- Evaluates RBAC and ABAC policies using a minimal CEL-like DSL.
- Exposes feature flag and license verification endpoints.

### Secrets Vault

- Stores encrypted secrets metadata and supports basic key rotation.

### Compliance Service

- Generates simple audit summaries.

### Gateway

- GraphQL API that orchestrates the services and enforces authorization middleware.
