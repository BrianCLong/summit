curl -X GET "https://api.algolia.com/1/indexes/docs/analytics" \
  -H "X-Algolia-API-Key: $SEARCH_KEY" \
  -H "X-Algolia-Application-ID: $APP_ID" \
  > search-analytics-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Process zero-result queries
jq '.topSearches[] | select(.nbHits == 0) | .search' search-analytics.json \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > zero-results.txt
```

### Manual Review Process
