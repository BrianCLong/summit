## Current Backlog Status

No backlog items could be generated without paper details. Once paper metadata is available, we will rank opportunities and publish the top 10 backlog entries here.

## Next Steps to Unblock

1. Provide the paper list (titles + links) for ingestion, or supply an authenticated fetch of the Substack post.
2. Rerun the research-to-product pipeline to populate `papers.json`, backlog tables, ADRs, and PR-sized implementation plans.
3. Re-score backlog items using the 5-factor rubric (value, differentiation, effort, risk, time-to-impact) and publish P0/P1/P2 rankings.
