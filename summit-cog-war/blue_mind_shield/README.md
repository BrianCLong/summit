# Blue MindShield: Defensive Operations

This module houses the Blue MindShield, the defensive core of SummitCogWar. It is responsible for developing and deploying proactive defenses against cognitive threats and influence operations.

## Key Components

- **Semantic Firewalls:** Real-time analysis and filtering of incoming information streams to detect and neutralize malicious narratives.
- **Memetic Vaccines:** Systems for generating and disseminating counter-narratives or "vaccines" to build resilience against specific memetic attacks.
- **Cognition Dashboards:** The backend services that power the Streamlit UI, providing real-time metrics on societal cognitive states, such as polarization entropy and resilience indices.
