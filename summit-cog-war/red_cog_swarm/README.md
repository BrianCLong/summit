This module contains the core components of the Red CogSwarm, the offensive operations wing of SummitCogWar. Its purpose is to develop and deploy AI agents capable of crafting and disseminating hyper-personalized memeplexes for strategic influence.

## Key Components

- **Memeplex Crafters:** AI agents that generate novel memetic content, including deepfake narratives and emotional anchors.
- **Athena Chain Engine:** An implementation of the extended Access → Trust → Belief → Behavior → Society model for phased deployment.
- **Adversarial Cognition Sims:** Tools for simulating the cognitive impact of memeplexes on target populations.
