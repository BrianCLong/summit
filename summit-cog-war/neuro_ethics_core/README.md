# Neuro-Ethics Core: Governance and Safety

This module represents the Neuro-Ethics Core, the ethical and safety backbone of SummitCogWar. It is responsible for ensuring that all operations are conducted responsibly and with a deep understanding of the potential societal impact.

## Key Components

- **Bias Audit Framework:** A suite of tools for continuously auditing and mitigating biases within the AI models and simulation environments.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interface:** The mechanisms for escalating critical decisions to human operators for review and approval.
- **Ethical Benchmark Suite:** A set of rigorous, PhD-level benchmarks for evaluating the ethical performance and unintended consequences of cognitive operations. This includes metrics like memetic half-life and cognitive collateral damage assessments.
