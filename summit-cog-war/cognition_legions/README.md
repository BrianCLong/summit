# Cognition Legions: Massive-Scale Simulation

This module contains the Cognition Legions, a massive-scale simulation environment for modeling societal cognition. It serves as the primary testing and validation ground for both Red CogSwarm and Blue MindShield operations.

## Key Components

- **Digital Mind Foundry:** Tools for creating and managing a population of over 100,000 digital minds, each with a unique cognitive profile derived from OSINT data.
- **Graph-Neural Network Engine:** The core simulation engine, responsible for modeling the emergent behaviors and belief dynamics of the digital population.
- **Scenario Builder:** A framework for designing and executing complex cognitive warfare scenarios, such as election interference or a public health crisis.
