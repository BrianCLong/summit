# Advantages — LLCT

- Introduces explicit, scoped linking authority to prevent uncontrolled cross-target correlation.
- Limits privacy risk with bounded hop counts, TTLs, and egress budgets enforced at module execution and graph materialization.
- Produces audit-ready linkage receipts stored in hash-chained ledgers with optional TEE attestations.
- Supports counterfactual tokens to evaluate information loss for tighter scopes.
- Integrates replay tokens and transparency logging for reproducibility and governance.
