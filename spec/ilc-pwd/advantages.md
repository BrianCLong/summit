# ILC-PWD Advantages

- Maintains inference latency SLOs during on-the-fly model adaptation by isolating training spillover from critical paths.
- Balances compute across regions while respecting data residency, reducing stranded capacity and compliance exposure.
- Integrates carbon-aware routing to minimize energy footprint without sacrificing tenant fairness or reliability.
- Provides deterministic rollback and replay, accelerating recovery from failed fine-tune iterations.
