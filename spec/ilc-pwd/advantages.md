# Advantages over Prior Art — ILC-PWD

- Converts opaque intelligence scores into an explicit lifecycle state machine with provable transitions justified by minimal support sets.
- Applies provenance-weighted decay that differentiates evidence classes and freshness, improving stability and explainability.
- Incorporates conflict measures and hysteresis to reduce oscillation between lifecycle states.
- Supports counterfactual remediation impacts on lifecycle state, enabling actionable decisioning rather than opaque scoring.
- Emits replayable lifecycle artifacts tied to policy and index versions for governance and auditability.
