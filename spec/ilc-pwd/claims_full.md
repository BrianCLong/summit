# ILC-PWD Claims (Full)

## Independent Claims

1. A pipeline that orchestrates incremental learning cycles (ILC) with policy-aware workload distribution (PWD) across heterogeneous accelerators to maintain latency targets under fluctuating demand.
2. A scheduler that co-optimizes model fine-tuning batches and inference traffic by reallocating micro-jobs based on live telemetry, carbon budgets, and tenant fairness constraints.
3. A non-transitory computer-readable medium embodying instructions to simulate failure scenarios and pre-stage rollback checkpoints for each distributed training shard.

## Dependent Claims

- The pipeline of claim 1 wherein workload distribution accounts for jurisdictional data residency and isolation requirements before task placement.
- The scheduler of claim 2 wherein priority queues incorporate customer service-level credits and dynamic throttling on breach detection.
- The medium of claim 3 wherein rollback checkpoints are cryptographically signed and anchored to a governance ledger for auditability.
