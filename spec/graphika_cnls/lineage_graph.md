# Narrative Lineage Graph

## Construction

- Generate canonical fingerprints: text hashes, media perceptual hashes, normalized resource identifiers.
- Nodes: content items; edges: quoted, remixed, or linked relations inferred from fingerprints and temporal order.
- Provenance tags: ingestion source, timestamps, actor identifiers where available.

## Outputs

- Narrative clusters with lineage paths.
- Coordination indicators via synchronized posting and shared fingerprints.
- Capsule-ready lineage slices respecting execution budgets.
