# Stance Drift Detection

## Representation

- Compute stance embeddings and polarity scores conditioned on target topics.
- Track stance along lineage paths within narrative clusters.

## Detection

- Identify reframing events when stance change exceeds thresholds.
- Associate stance drift with lineage segments for replay visualization.
- Include provenance and coordination signals for context.
