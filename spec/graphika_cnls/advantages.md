# Cross-Network Narrative Lineage & Stance Drift (CNLS) — Advantages

- Goes beyond network visualization to compute **lineage** (who copied/quoted/remixed whom) plus **stance drift** over time.
- Enables reproducible assessments via **lineage capsules** bound to snapshot/time window (audit + replay).
- Supports cross-platform linkage without relying on a single platform’s internal identifiers (uses stable content/media/URL fingerprints and provenance).
