# ITD-OIP Claims (Full)

## Independent Claims

1. An intelligent threat dissection and observation insight pipeline (ITD-OIP) that transforms raw security telemetry into layered attack narratives with mapped MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
2. A method for capturing temporal causality between threat events using graph-based timelines, enabling root-cause identification and proactive containment recommendations.
3. A system that generates red-team quality simulations from observed attack paths, replaying them in a sandbox to validate controls and prioritize fixes.

## Dependent Claims

- The pipeline of claim 1 wherein narratives are enriched with LLM-generated analyst notes that include citations to original evidence.
- The method of claim 2 wherein causality edges include policy compliance annotations for regulated workloads.
- The system of claim 3 wherein sandbox replays feed coverage metrics back into detection rule catalogs and governance ledgers.
