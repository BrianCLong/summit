# Advantages over Prior Art — ITD-OIP

- Automatically distills interactive transform traces into reusable compiled investigation macros rather than manual workflows.
- Performs plan optimization (dedupe, batching, join reordering, filter pushdown) with policy and license verification prior to execution.
- Produces witness chains for each transform step, enabling reproducibility and audit without replaying entire interactive sessions.
