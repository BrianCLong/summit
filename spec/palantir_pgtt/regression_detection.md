# Regression Detection

- **Access test cases:** boundary and redaction-focused cases exercising policy edges.
- **Outcome comparison:** reference outcomes derived from prior policy/ontology versions; detect allow-expansion or deny-expansion.
- **Explanation artifact:** minimal set of policy rules responsible for differences.
- **Budgeting:** cap total test cases or runtime; terminate gracefully when exceeded.
