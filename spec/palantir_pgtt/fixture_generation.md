- **Constraint solving:** uses ontology field types and relation cardinalities to synthesize realistic graph instances.
- **Purpose-aware fixtures:** include subject context and purpose metadata for policy evaluation.
- **Determinism:** seeds captured in replay tokens for reproducible fixture sets.
