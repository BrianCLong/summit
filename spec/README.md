# Summit Patent-Style Specification Package

This `/spec` folder provides structured patent-style specifications for five competitor wedges requested by leadership. Each wedge has aligned structure to speed filing-ready drafting and downstream integration work.

## Layout

- `common/`: Shared primitives reused across wedges.
- `graphika_anfis/`: Adversarial Narrative Fingerprinting + Intervention Simulator.
- `recordedfuture_ilc_pwd/`: IOC Lifecycle Compiler with Provenance-Weighted Decay.
- `palantir_oaeac/`: Ontology ABI + Enforced Action Contracts.
- `maltego_itd_oip/`: Interactive Trace Distillation into Optimized Investigation Plans.
- `spiderfoot_fopb_lg/`: Federated OSINT with Privacy Budgets + Legal/ToS Gates.

Each wedge includes a short spec, supporting models/IR, threat considerations, and a `claims.md` file with method and system claim skeletons plus dependent variations.
