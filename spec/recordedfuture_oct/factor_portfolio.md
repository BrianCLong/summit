# Factor Portfolio

## Composition

- Factor components derived from signal subsets (exposure, exploitability, actor interest, infrastructure proximity).
- Weights calibrated using outcome data with source-trust decay.
- Minimal support sets tracked under proof budgets.

## Outputs

- Decomposable factor scores with provenance references.
- Counterfactual impacts for remediation scenarios.
