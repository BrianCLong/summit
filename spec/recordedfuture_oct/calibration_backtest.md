# Calibration & Backtest

## Calibration Strategy

- Online or batch learning updates factor weights with outcomes.
- Decay functions reduce the impact of stale signals.
- Calibration outputs are recorded in witness chains.

## Backtest Artifact

- Historical evaluation window and holdout selection.
- Confidence intervals and statistical significance tests.
- Comparison to uncalibrated baseline models.

## Evidence Packaging

- Backtest artifacts are stored with replay tokens.
- Counterfactual remediation impacts are optionally included.
