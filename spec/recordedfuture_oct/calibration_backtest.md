# Calibration and Backtest

## Calibration

- Online learning updates factor weights when new outcomes arrive.
- Provenance-weighted decay reduces influence of stale or low-trust signals.

## Backtesting

- Historical evaluation produces confidence intervals and significance tests versus uncalibrated baselines.
- Includes replay token and policy version to enable deterministic audits.
