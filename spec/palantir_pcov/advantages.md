# Policy-Compiled Ontology Views with Stable ABI (PCOV) — Advantages

- Eliminates runtime “filter after fetch” by compiling **policy-scoped ontology views** ahead of time.
- Provides a **stable ABI** for integrations and agents despite schema evolution.
- Produces auditable view artifacts (what is visible, why, versioned, replayable).
