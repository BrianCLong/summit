# Advantages

- Produces role attributions (not just maps) using constrained routing with explicit temporal
  causality.
- Outputs a role certificate with minimal support edges/nodes and replay token for audit.
- Enables safe automation: downstream actions gated by role confidence and counterfactual
  stability.
