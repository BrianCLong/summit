- Computes origin sets via inverse diffusion rather than only mapping propagation, distinguishing initiators from amplifiers.
- Produces uncertainty-aware origin certificates with credible intervals and alternative hypotheses.
- Emits replayable certificates with deterministic tokens and cryptographic commitments for governance and reproducibility.
- Supports counterfactual suppression planning to estimate mitigation impact.
- Integrates TEE attestations and transparency logging for trustworthy audits.
