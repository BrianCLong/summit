# Quarantine Actions and Justifications

## Actions

- Weight reduction with minimum floor.
- Full exclusion from fusion pipeline.
- Corroboration-only routing requiring confirmation from independent feeds.

## Justification Witness

- Minimal evidence set: divergence metrics, false-positive deltas, outcome alignment stats.
- Proof budget: cap evidence count or bytes while maintaining verifiability.
- Replay token: time window + feed version set enabling deterministic recalibration.

## Transparency

- Quarantine decisions logged to transparency log and witness ledger with policy decision identifiers.
- Alerts emitted when drift exceeds threshold for configured dwell time.
