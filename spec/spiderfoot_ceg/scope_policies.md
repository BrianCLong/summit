# Scope Policies

Egress and execution policies keyed to classification scopes.

- **CUI:** passive-first, active probing requires authorization, tight destination allowlist, byte budget enforced.
- **NATO Restricted:** coalition destination class allowlist, heightened redaction defaults, transparency log required.
- **Internal:** standard guardrails, logging enabled, relaxed redaction.
