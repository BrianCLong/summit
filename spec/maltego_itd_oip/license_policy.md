# License & Policy Verification

- Enforce effect constraints: deny export transforms without authorization token.
- Apply data source license rules per jurisdiction and target sensitivity.
- Validate privacy budget and egress limits before executing batched transforms.
- Attach policy decision identifiers to each transform step in witness chain.
