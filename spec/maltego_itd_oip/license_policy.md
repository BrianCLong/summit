# License & Policy Constraints

## License Constraints

- Map each data source to license metadata (e.g., export restrictions, retention limits).
- Disallow transforms that violate license scope or jurisdiction.

## Policy Enforcement

- Policy decisions must be resolved before execution.
- Export effects require explicit authorization tokens.
- Retention limits enforced by automatic purge jobs.
