# Grammar Learning

## Steps
1. Normalize session traces into transform graphs with effect metadata (READ/WRITE/EXPORT) and license usage.
2. Perform frequent subgraph mining to extract candidate production rules.
3. Weight production rules by historical success, latency, and cost metrics.
4. Version grammar and record source session references for provenance.
