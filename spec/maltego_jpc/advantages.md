# Advantages — JPC

- **Minimal source calls**: preserves join semantics while minimizing
  query count and egress costs.
- **Audit-ready join certificates**: produces witness chains for
  verification without re-running workflows.
- **Performance optimization**: batches queries per endpoint and caches
  stable results.
