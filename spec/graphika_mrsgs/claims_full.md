# Claims — MRSGS

## Independent claims

1. **Method**
   1.1 Receiving interaction events between actors and content items within successive time windows.  
   1.2 Constructing, for a current time window, a bipartite interaction graph comprising actor nodes, content nodes, and edges representing interactions.  
   1.3 Computing a multi-resolution spectral sketch of the bipartite interaction graph, the multi-resolution spectral sketch comprising at least a first sketch at a first resolution and a second sketch at a second resolution.  
   1.4 Comparing the multi-resolution spectral sketch to at least one reference sketch to compute an anomaly score.  
   1.5 Determining that a coordinated campaign condition is satisfied based on the anomaly score.  
   1.6 Outputting a campaign artifact comprising the anomaly score, a localized subgraph explanation identifying a subset of nodes or edges contributing to the anomaly score, and a replay token.

2. **System**
   A system comprising one or more processors and one or more non-transitory computer-readable media storing instructions that, when executed, cause performance of the method of claim 1.

3. **CRM**
   A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed, cause performance of the method of claim 1.

## Dependent claims

4. The method of claim 1, wherein computing the multi-resolution spectral sketch comprises computing approximations of eigenvalues or singular values of a normalized adjacency matrix or Laplacian.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the multi-resolution spectral sketch is updated incrementally using streaming updates without recomputing from scratch.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein comparing comprises computing a distance between sketches using at least one of cosine distance, Wasserstein distance, or KL divergence over binned spectra.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference sketch is selected from a baseline library indexed by topic, language, platform, or region.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the localized subgraph explanation is generated by selecting nodes with highest influence on the anomaly score under a budget limiting explanation size.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising enforcing an execution budget comprising at least one of maximum edges processed, maximum memory usage, or maximum runtime per window.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the replay token comprises a snapshot identifier, a schema version, a seed value, and a time window identifier.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the campaign artifact includes a cryptographic commitment to identifiers of the subset of nodes via a Merkle root.
12. The system of claim 2, further comprising a trusted execution environment configured to attest to sketch computation, wherein the campaign artifact includes an attestation quote.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising correlating the coordinated campaign condition with external intelligence graph entities by resolving shared resources.
