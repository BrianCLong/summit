# OAEAC Claims (Full)

## Independent Claims

1. An orchestration layer for omni-channel anomaly and event-aware controls (OAEAC) that correlates streaming signals across sensors, applications, and user behavior to trigger policy actions.
2. A method that assigns adaptive risk scores by combining causal graphs, seasonal baselines, and adversarial pattern libraries, routing escalations to human reviewers with full provenance trails.
3. A computer-implemented system that auto-generates remediation playbooks aligned to the detected anomaly class and enforces staged rollouts with blast-radius limits.

## Dependent Claims

- The orchestration layer of claim 1 wherein correlation is augmented with embeddings of historical mitigations to improve detection precision.
- The method of claim 2 wherein risk scores include explainability vectors capturing contributing signals and suppression rationale.
- The system of claim 3 wherein remediation playbooks are versioned and cryptographically anchored to an audit ledger before activation.
