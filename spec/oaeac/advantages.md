# Advantages over Prior Art — OAEAC

- Generates a machine-enforceable ABI from an ontology, enabling consistent integrations and tool orchestration.
- Enforces action contracts (preconditions/postconditions + effect types) with witnessed execution, reducing operational errors and audit gaps.
- Supports counterfactual simulation and tamper-evident witness ledgers, enabling reproducible governance for graph state changes.
