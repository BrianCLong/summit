# Advantages over Prior Art — OAEAC

- Generates a machine-enforceable ABI from an ontology, enabling consistent integrations and tool orchestration.
- Enforces action contracts (preconditions, postconditions, effect types) with witnessed execution, reducing operational errors and audit gaps.
- Supports counterfactual simulation and tamper-evident witness ledgers for reproducible governance of graph state changes.
- Couples policy authorization with effect signatures, improving least-privilege control over read/write/export actions.
- Emits determinism tokens and attestation-ready artifacts for defensible execution replay.
