# Sensitivity Budget

## Enforcement

- Limit returned bytes and entity counts using weighted cost functions per sensitivity class.
- Track retention TTLs; retention enforcer deletes artifacts upon expiration.
- Rate limits applied during module execution to respect policy/legal constraints.

## Counterfactuals

- Optional counterfactual capsule outputs for alternative module sets estimating information gain loss.
