# Selective Disclosure

## Disclosure Strategies

- **Aggregation**: counts, ranges, or hashed indicators.
- **Redaction**: mask sensitive identifiers or attributes.
- **Sampling**: deterministic sampling using replay token seed.

## Enforcement

- Disclosure budgets define maximum bytes and sensitivity class.
- Enforcement is logged in witness chains and transparency logs.
- Output includes proof of applied redactions.
