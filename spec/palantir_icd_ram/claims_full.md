# Claims — Interface Control Doc + Rights Assertion Machine (ICD-RAM)

## Independent Claims

1. Method: receive architecture spec; generate versioned ICD; designate proprietary boundaries and tech insertion points; generate rights assertion artifact; output OA/MOSA package with ICD, conformance tests, rights artifact.
2. System executing the method.
3. CRM storing instructions to perform the method.

## Dependent Claims

4. Conformance test suite validates third-party plug-ins against ICD.
5. OA/MOSA package scores interoperability, composability, reusability, maintainability, extensibility.
6. Rights assertion artifact formatted as structured assertion table for contract deliverables.
7. Peer review rights disclosure plan for reviewable modules.
8. Counterfactual insertion plan simulating module replacement performance impact.
9. Interface compatibility rules include deprecation timelines and adapter generation.
10. Transparency log stores digests of OA/MOSA packages.
11. TEE attestation for package generation.
12. Proprietary boundaries include stubs enabling evaluator execution without code disclosure.
