# FOPB-LG Claims (Full)

## Independent Claims

1. A federated optimization and policy boundary layer for language generation (FOPB-LG) that orchestrates model execution across edge and cloud nodes while enforcing tenant-specific safety rules.
2. A method for splitting generation tasks into constrained sub-requests that respect latency budgets and policy boundaries before recombining responses with unified provenance.
3. A storage medium containing instructions that maintain differential privacy guarantees during cross-tenant federated fine-tuning.

## Dependent Claims

- The layer of claim 1 wherein routing decisions incorporate cost ceilings, carbon budgets, and jurisdiction filters in real time.
- The method of claim 2 wherein recombination includes confidence scoring and automatic redaction of sensitive tokens based on policy context.
- The medium of claim 3 wherein privacy budgets are monitored and capped per tenant with automatic alerts on threshold breaches.
