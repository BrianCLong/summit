# Peer-Reviewable Transform Capsules (PRC)

PRC packages transforms and workflows as capsules containing interface contracts, provenance, proprietary declarations, and evaluator harnesses.

## Objectives

- Provide evaluator-ready capsules with deterministic execution and replay manifests.
- Declare proprietary elements with stubs for closed components.
- Capture witness chains for inputs and outputs.

## Capsule lifecycle

1. Receive transform specification.
2. Generate capsule with interface contract and execution plan.
3. Execute transform to produce outputs and witness chain.
4. Package outputs, witness chain, proprietary declaration, and execution harness for distribution.
