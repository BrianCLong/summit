# ANFIS Claims (Full)

## Independent Claims

1. A system that synthesizes adaptive neural feature interaction scores (ANFIS) by blending structured knowledge graph signals with unstructured embeddings to rank entity relationships in near real time.
2. A method for dynamically weighting graph-derived provenance against model confidence to deliver regulator-ready evidence bundles alongside ranked insights.
3. A computer-readable medium storing instructions that generate interpretable feature attributions for each ANFIS recommendation, combining causal traces, edge metadata, and retrieval context.

## Dependent Claims

- The system of claim 1 wherein ranking adjustments are continuously updated from feedback loops sourced from human adjudications and automated validators.
- The method of claim 2 wherein provenance is normalized to jurisdictional policies and tenant-specific sensitivity tiers before delivery.
- The medium of claim 3 wherein feature attributions surface both statistical saliency and policy compliance checks for each edge considered.
