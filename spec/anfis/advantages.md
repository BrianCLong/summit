# ANFIS Advantages

- Hybridizes symbolic graph reasoning with neural embeddings to improve recall on sparse relationship discovery without degrading precision.
- Produces evidence-aligned rankings that can be audited by governance teams and exported into compliance ledgers.
- Continuously self-calibrates through online learning loops, reducing manual feature engineering overhead.
- Exposes standardized telemetry hooks so ranking changes and provenance shifts are observable in production.
