# Advantages over Prior Art — ANFIS

- Produces coordination fingerprints using multi-signal features (timing burstiness, near-duplicate similarity, hub concentration, cross-platform reuse, link laundering), rather than relying on visualization-only network maps.
- Executes counterfactual interventions on a temporal narrative graph with budgeted recomputation to quantify predicted spread reduction before action.
- Emits auditable attribution artifacts bound to deterministic replay tokens so analytical outcomes are reproducible and reviewable.
- Combines provenance references with cryptographic commitments to support defensible attribution while protecting sensitive identifiers.
- Supports policy-aware redaction and access controls during graph construction, enabling compliance-aware analytics without losing replay fidelity.
