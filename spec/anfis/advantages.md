# Advantages over Prior Art — ANFIS

- Produces coordination fingerprints using multi-signal features (timing, near-duplicate similarity, hub concentration, link laundering) rather than visualization-only network maps.
- Executes counterfactual interventions on a temporal narrative graph with budgeted recomputation to quantify predicted spread reduction before action.
- Emits an auditable attribution artifact bound to a deterministic replay token, enabling reproducible intelligence assessments and governance.
