# Portfolio-Efficient Filing Plan

This plan outlines a claim strategy that maximizes shared independent claims while
allowing wedge-specific dependent branches for OA/MOSA artifacts, label escrow, and
multi-performer collaboration.

## Shared Independent Claim Spine

Use a shared independent claim across IEAP, VCEC, and MPEP covering:

1. Determinism token usage and dataset snapshot binding.
2. Execution under policy-as-code controls.
3. Generation of proof objects with Merkle commitments.
4. Transparency log inclusion proofs.

## Wedge-Specific Dependent Branches

### IEAP Branch

- Evaluator interface registration and conformance suite delivery.
- Metric proof objects with compute budget enforcement.
- Evaluator-run replay tokens.

### VCEC Branch

- Capsule compilation with effect typing and egress budgets.
- Witness chains with hash-chained intermediates.
- Proprietary stubs that preserve evaluator execution.

### MPEP Branch

- Scope tokens with TTL and performer identity binding.
- Egress receipts and shard manifests.
- Selective disclosure outputs with verification hashes.

### ICD-RAM Branch

- OA/MOSA package generation with ICDs and conformance tests.
- Rights assertion artifact with government rights categories.
- Peer-review rights disclosures and tech insertion points.

### EBLE Branch

- Escrowed label bundles with manifests and proof hashes.
- Selective disclosure policies and drift alarms.
- Replay tokens binding to assessment cycles.

## Filing Sequence

1. File shared independent claim set (IEAP/VCEC/MPEP core).
2. File dependent branches for ICD-RAM and EBLE to reduce fragmentation.
3. Maintain a single glossary to align terminology across filings.

## Evidence & Support

- Include deterministic replay transcripts as evidence exhibits.
- Provide sample transparency log inclusion proofs for shared claims.
- Use conformance suite results to demonstrate enablement.
