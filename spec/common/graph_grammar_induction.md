# Graph Grammar Induction

## Purpose

Learn transform graph grammars from investigation traces to synthesize optimized
macro workflows under policy and license constraints.

## Inputs

- `session_traces` with transform graphs and outputs
- `objective` (coverage, precision, latency, cost)
- policy and license constraints

## Outputs

- grammar productions
- candidate macros
- justification mappings to productions
- replay token + commitments
