# Transparency Log

## Purpose

The transparency log is an append-only ledger that stores receipts for all
artifacts generated by wedge workflows. It provides public verifiability and
supports audit trails.

## Log Entry Schema

- `entry_id`
- `artifact_id`
- `artifact_type`
- `commitment_root`
- `policy_decision_id`
- `replay_token`
- `attestation_reference?`
- `timestamp`

## Operational Requirements

- Entries are immutable and hash-chained.
- Log segments are periodically anchored to external time sources.
- Access to raw evidence identifiers is access-controlled.

## Audit Workflow

1. Retrieve log entry and verify hash chain.
2. Validate commitments against stored evidence.
3. Confirm policy decision linkage.
4. Verify attestation if present.
