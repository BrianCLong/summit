- Stage-level logs, intermediate artifacts, and summary reports.
- Minimal datasets and synthetic cases for smoke testing.

## Rights and boundaries

- Proprietary element declarations with stubs for closed components.
- License terms for evaluator access and peer-review rights.

## Submission workflow

- Publish packages to the transparency log with hash commitments.
- Provide a replay token and determinism seed to rerun workloads.
