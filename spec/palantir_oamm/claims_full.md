# OAMM Claims (Method, System, CRM)

## Independent claims

1. Method: receive ontology and interface policy; compile ontology into versioned interfaces; designate proprietary boundary and open insertion point; enforce runtime traversal through versioned interfaces; output architecture artifact with interface definitions, proprietary metadata, and technology-insertion plan.
2. System: processors and memory executing the method above.
3. Computer-readable medium: instructions to perform the method above.

## Dependent claims

4. Interface policy includes compatibility rules across versions for evaluator and partner systems.
5. Open insertion points include a plug-in ABI for analytics, transforms, or policy checks.
6. Architecture artifact includes peer-review enablement metadata specifying reviewable modules and rights.
7. Conformance test suite validates third-party plug-ins against the interfaces.
8. Counterfactual insertion plan replaces a module and simulates performance impact.
9. Runtime enforcement includes a witness chain committing to interface calls and versions.
10. System includes a transparency log storing digests of architecture artifacts.
11. Interface traversal is budgeted by latency constraints for operational scenarios.
12. System caches interface adapters keyed by ontology version.
13. System includes a trusted execution environment configured to attest to enforcement.
