Conformance tests ensure plug-ins and adapters honor interface contracts.

## Scope

- Latency and budget checks for interface traversal.
- Witness-chain verification for adapter logging.

## Execution

- Tests run inside evaluator containers using published OpenAPI definitions.
- Results are recorded with Merkle commitments and added to transparency log entries.
