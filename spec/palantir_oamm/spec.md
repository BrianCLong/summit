# Open-Architecture Mission Mesh (OAMM)

OAMM enforces a MOSA-style mesh where ontology objects and actions are exposed through stable, versioned interfaces with explicit proprietary boundaries and insertion points.

## Objectives

- Compile ontologies into versioned interface sets for reads, writes, and actions.
- Declare proprietary module boundaries and open insertion points for technology insertion.
- Enforce runtime traversal through interfaces with attestation and witness chains.

## Artifacts

- Interface policy defining modular boundaries and compatibility rules.
- Proprietary boundary metadata with evaluator stubs.
- Technology-insertion plan and conformance test suite for plug-ins.
