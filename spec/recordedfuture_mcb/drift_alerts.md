# MCB Drift Alerts

Drift detection keeps metric contracts aligned with data behavior.

## Detection

- Monitor feed statistics and outcome label distributions for drift.
- Trigger alerts when thresholds breach contract-defined tolerances.

## Reporting

- Include drift findings in benchmark binders with impacted metrics and confidence notes.
- Provide replay tokens for pre- and post-drift windows to facilitate reproduction.

## Remediation

- Allow contract renegotiation or retraining recommendations based on drift severity.
