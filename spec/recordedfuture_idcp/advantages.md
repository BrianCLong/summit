# Advantages — IDCP

- Collision-aware canonicalization reduces false blocks and false joins from ambiguous indicators.
- Collision proofs with safe action envelopes improve automation reliability and auditability.
- Multi-modal context detection integrates provenance and graph neighborhood signals for real-world IOC ambiguity.
- Replay tokens and transparency logging allow reproducible deconfliction under budgeted verification.
- Supports attested computation and counterfactual deconfliction scenarios.
