# Advantages — POAR

- **Proof-carrying actions**: governance becomes portable, verifiable proof
  objects rather than opaque logs.
- **Deterministic replay**: outputs are bound to snapshots, policies, and
  seeds for third-party verification.
- **Safe federation**: share proofs without disclosing raw data.
