# Manifest Verification

- **Shard manifest:** commitments to shards and scope identifiers; signed and stored in transparency log.
- **Verifier role:** confirms shard integrity using commitments without requiring access to unshared shards.
- **Egress budgets:** per-shard enforcement for bytes/entity count; logs budget compliance.
- **Counterfactuals:** optional alternative partitions for changed policy with information loss estimates.
