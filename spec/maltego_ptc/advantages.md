# Provenance-Typed Transform Contracts (PTC) — Advantages

- Transforms become **typed contracts** (effects + disclosure + provenance guarantees), not ad-hoc scripts.
- Returns **proof-carrying transform outputs** and witness chains suitable for compliance and reproducible investigations.
- Enables compiler optimizations (batching/dedup/caching) while preserving contract correctness.
