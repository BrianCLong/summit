# Architecture map discovery (TODO)

1. Confirm Summit runtime language for new subsystems (TypeScript vs Python).
2. Locate canonical configuration roots and feature-flag standards.
3. Identify existing governance/policy engine entrypoints.
4. Find established eval harness patterns (tests + metrics output).
5. Replace placeholder module paths in `worldsim/` with canonical package locations.
6. Record findings in `ARCHITECTURE_MAP.generated.yaml`.
