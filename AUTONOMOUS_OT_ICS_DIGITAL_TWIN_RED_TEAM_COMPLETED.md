# Issue Closed: autonomous_ot_ics_digital_twin_red_team

This issue has been resolved and is now closed.

## Summary

Finalized the autonomous digital twin environment for OT/ICS, enabling red team exercises without impacting production systems.

## Implementation Details

- Modeled critical industrial components within a virtualized lab.
- Automated attack playbooks to evaluate defensive coverage.
- Added autonomous scenario generator to simulate multi-stage attack chains in the virtual ICS environment.
- Each exercise outputs a chain-of-custody record and exposes a graph of affected assets for analysis.

## Next Steps

- Model additional industrial protocols and devices in the twin environment.
- Instrument telemetry collectors to log attacker and defender actions.
- Feed gathered insights into hardening playbooks for production systems.
