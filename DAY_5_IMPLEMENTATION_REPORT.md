## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### **Workflow Optimization Strategy**
```yaml
Pattern Applied Across All Workflows:
1. Node.js Setup:
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
   - node-version: 20
   - cache: 'pnpm' # Changed from 'npm'

2. Package Manager:
   - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
   - version: 9

3. Installation:
   - pnpm install --frozen-lockfile # Changed from npm ci

4. Commands:
   - pnpm run [command] # Changed from npm run
```

### **Preview Environment Resource Optimization**
```yaml
Helm Configuration Applied:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 100m          # Minimal baseline
      memory: 256Mi      # Conservative memory
    limits:
      cpu: 500m          # Reasonable cap
      memory: 1Gi        # Prevent memory leaks

  autoscaling:
    enabled: false       # Single instance for testing

  replicaCount: 1        # Cost-effective for preview
```

### **Cleanup Automation Features**
```bash
Key Capabilities:
- ✅ Namespace age detection with configurable thresholds
- ✅ PR status validation (preserves active development)
- ✅ Graceful resource cleanup (Helm → Namespace → Images)
- ✅ Error handling and rollback safety
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- ✅ Dry-run mode for safe testing

Safety Mechanisms:
- PR state validation prevents active development disruption
- Timeout protections prevent hanging operations
- Error isolation ensures partial failures don't cascade
- Comprehensive logging enables troubleshooting
```
