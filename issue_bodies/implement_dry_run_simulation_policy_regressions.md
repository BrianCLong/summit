### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 5) Risks & Mitigations
Excerpt/why: "Policy regressions → ... dry‑run sim."

### Problem / Goal
Develop a dry-run simulation mode for policies to test changes without affecting production.

### Proposed Approach
Implement a feature that allows policy changes to be simulated against historical or synthetic data, providing a report on their impact (e.g., number of new denials, changes in access) before deployment.

### Tasks
- [ ] Design policy dry-run simulation interface.
- [ ] Implement simulation logic.
- [ ] Generate simulation reports.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a proposed policy change, when a dry-run simulation is executed, then a report is generated detailing the impact of the change without affecting live systems.
- Metrics/SLO: Policy dry-run simulation completes within 10 minutes.
- Tests: Unit tests for simulation logic.
- Observability: Logs for simulation runs.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
