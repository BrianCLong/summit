### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 3) Nonâ€‘Functional Requirements - Privacy & Policy
Excerpt/why: "purpose limitation tags"

### Problem / Goal

Tag data with its intended purpose and enforce access based on these tags.

### Proposed Approach

Extend the data model to include purpose limitation tags and integrate policy checks (e.g., via OPA) into data access pathways to ensure data is only used for its specified purpose.

### Tasks

- [ ] Define purpose limitation tags.
- [ ] Implement data tagging with purpose.
- [ ] Integrate purpose-based access control with policy engine.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given data is tagged with a purpose, when accessed, then access is granted only if the access request aligns with the data's purpose, otherwise it is denied.
- Metrics/SLO: Purpose checks add minimal overhead to access latency.
- Tests: Unit tests for purpose tagging, integration tests for purpose enforcement.
- Observability: Logs for purpose-based access decisions.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: Purpose limitation policies.
- Compliance: Ensures adherence to data privacy principles (e.g., GDPR Article 5).

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: [policy] Implement ABAC/OPA policies for policy-gateway

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Purpose limitation tags design approved.
- DOD: Tagging and enforcement implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
