### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 4) Dependencies
Excerpt/why: "Gateway federation plumbing (Apollo Rover) or direct GraphQL addition to `server/*`."

### Problem / Goal

Set up GraphQL gateway federation using Apollo Rover or directly add GraphQL to the server.

### Proposed Approach

Choose between Apollo Federation and direct GraphQL implementation, then configure the gateway to expose the Maestro Composer's GraphQL schema and resolvers.

### Tasks

- [ ] Select GraphQL implementation strategy (Federation vs. direct).
- [ ] Implement GraphQL schema and resolvers.
- [ ] Configure GraphQL gateway/server.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a GraphQL client, when queries are sent to the gateway, then the Maestro Composer's GraphQL API is accessible and functional.
- Metrics/SLO: GraphQL query p95 latency < 200ms.
- Tests: Integration tests for GraphQL API.
- Observability: GraphQL query metrics visible in dashboards.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: [orchestrator-core] Implement GraphQL read subgraph for workflows and executions

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: GraphQL gateway design approved.
- DOD: GraphQL implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
