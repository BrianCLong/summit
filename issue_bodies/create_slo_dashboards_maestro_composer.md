### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star - Success at Sprint End
Excerpt/why: "SLO dashboards live."

### Problem / Goal
Develop Grafana dashboards to monitor key Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the Maestro Composer backend.

### Proposed Approach
Configure Grafana dashboards to visualize metrics related to workflow enqueue latency, step handler latency, and other critical performance indicators, with alerts for SLO breaches.

### Tasks
- [ ] Identify key SLO metrics for dashboards.
- [ ] Design Grafana dashboards.
- [ ] Configure alerts for SLO breaches.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given the backend is running, when dashboards are viewed, then they accurately display real-time SLO metrics and trigger alerts on breaches.
- Metrics/SLO: SLO dashboards are live.
- Tests: N/A
- Observability: Dashboards are accessible and up-to-date.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [audit-telemetry] Implement Prometheus metrics (RED) for Maestro Composer

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: SLO dashboard design approved.
- DOD: Dashboards implemented, documentation updated.
