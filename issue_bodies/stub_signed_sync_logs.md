### Context
Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 12) Stretch
Excerpt/why: "Signed sync logs for offline disclosure export (edge kit stub)."

### Problem / Goal
Create a stub for signed synchronization logs to support offline disclosure export (Stretch Goal).

### Proposed Approach
Implement a placeholder module that simulates the generation and verification of signed logs for data synchronized during offline disclosure drafting.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define signed log format (stub).
- [ ] Implement signed log generation (stub).
- [ ] Implement signed log verification (stub).

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given an offline disclosure draft, when synchronized, then a signed log stub is generated and can be verified.
- Metrics/SLO: Signed log generation adds negligible overhead.
- Tests: Unit tests for stub functionality.
- Observability: N/A

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A
- Compliance: Ensures integrity and auditability of offline operations.

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [data-platform] Implement disclosure bundle generation (ZIP)

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Signed sync logs stub design approved.
- DOD: Code merged, tests pass, documentation updated.
