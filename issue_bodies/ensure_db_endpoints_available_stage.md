### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 4) Dependencies
Excerpt/why: "Postgres, Redis, Neo4j endpoints available in stage"

### Problem / Goal

Verify and configure connectivity to Postgres, Redis, and Neo4j in the staging environment for Maestro Composer.

### Proposed Approach

Ensure that the necessary database instances are provisioned in the staging environment and that the Maestro Composer backend services are correctly configured to connect to them.

### Tasks

- [ ] Verify database instance provisioning in stage.
- [ ] Configure connection strings/credentials for backend services.
- [ ] Implement connection health checks.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given the Maestro Composer backend is deployed to stage, when it starts, then it successfully connects to Postgres, Redis, and Neo4j.
- Metrics/SLO: Database connection p95 latency < 50ms.
- Tests: Integration tests for database connectivity.
- Observability: Logs for database connection status.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: [ci-cd] Develop Helm chart for Maestro Composer backend

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Database connectivity plan approved.
- DOD: Connectivity verified, documentation updated.
