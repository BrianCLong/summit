### Context
Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 6) Work Breakdown (By Workstream) - DevEx / SRE
Excerpt/why: "SLO dashboards: ingest E2E timings"

### Problem / Goal
Develop a dashboard to monitor end-to-end timings for data ingestion as a Service Level Objective.

### Proposed Approach
Configure a Grafana dashboard (or similar) to visualize ingest E2E timings collected from the system, setting appropriate alerts for SLO breaches.

### Tasks
- [ ] Identify ingest E2E timing metrics sources.
- [ ] Configure Grafana dashboard for ingest E2E timings.
- [ ] Define SLO thresholds and alerts.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given the system is ingesting data, when the dashboard is viewed, then it accurately displays ingest E2E timings and alerts on SLO breaches.
- Metrics/SLO: Dashboard shows ingest E2E timings within defined SLO.
- Tests: N/A
- Observability: Dashboard is live and accessible.

### Safety & Policy
