### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star
Excerpt/why: "Build a production‑ready backend for the Maestro Composer — a workflow/runbook authoring & execution service that lets the UI compose DAGs, validate them, version them, simulate them, execute them at scale, and audit everything."

### Problem / Goal
Design and implement the core workflow/runbook authoring and execution service for Maestro Composer backend.

### Proposed Approach
Develop the foundational microservice responsible for managing the lifecycle of workflows, from composition to execution and auditing.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define core service architecture.
- [ ] Implement workflow definition storage and retrieval.
- [ ] Implement workflow execution engine.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a workflow definition, when submitted, then the service can validate, version, simulate, and execute it.
- Metrics/SLO: Workflow creation p95 latency < 500ms.
- Tests: Unit, integration, and E2E tests for core functionalities.
- Observability: Key metrics for service health and performance.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: None

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Core service design approved.
- DOD: Service deployed, tests pass, documentation updated.
