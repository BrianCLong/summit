### Context

Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 6) Work Breakdown (By Workstream) - DevEx / SRE
Excerpt/why: "CI gates: schema contracts"

### Problem / Goal

Integrate a CI gate to enforce schema contracts, ensuring data consistency and preventing breaking changes.

### Proposed Approach

Implement a CI/CD pipeline step that validates schema changes against predefined contracts, failing the build if violations are detected.

### Tasks

- [ ] Define schema contract validation rules.
- [ ] Implement schema validation tool/script.
- [ ] Integrate schema validation into CI/CD pipeline.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a pull request with schema changes, when the CI gate runs, then it enforces schema contracts and fails the build on violations.
- Metrics/SLO: CI gate completes within 2 minutes.
- Tests: CI gate runs.
- Observability: CI pipeline logs show schema contract enforcement.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: [data-platform] Define canonical graph schema

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: CI gate for schema contracts design approved.
- DOD: CI gate implemented, documentation updated.
