### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 1) Scope & Deliverables - 1.2 Data Model
Excerpt/why: "Create migrations & models for: workflow_definitions, workflow_versions, workflow_steps, workflow_executions, execution_events, human_tasks, webhook_secrets"

### Problem / Goal
Develop database migrations for `workflow_definitions`, `workflow_versions`, `workflow_steps`, `workflow_executions`, `execution_events`, `human_tasks`, and `webhook_secrets`.

### Proposed Approach
Create SQL migration scripts (or use an ORM's migration tools) to define the schema for all specified tables, including primary keys, foreign keys, and indices.

### Tasks
- [ ] Design schema for each workflow-related table.
- [ ] Write migration scripts for table creation.
- [ ] Implement models/entities for ORM (if applicable).

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given the migration scripts are run, when the database is inspected, then all specified tables are created with correct schemas and relationships.
- Metrics/SLO: Migrations complete within 1 minute.
- Tests: Database schema validation tests.
- Observability: Logs for migration execution.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [orchestrator-core] Design and implement core workflow/runbook authoring service

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Database schema design approved.
- DOD: Migrations implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
