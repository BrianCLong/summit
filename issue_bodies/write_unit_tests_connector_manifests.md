### Context
Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 7) Test Plan - Unit
Excerpt/why: "connector manifests"

### Problem / Goal
Develop unit tests to validate connector manifests, ensuring their correctness and adherence to specifications.

### Proposed Approach
Write unit tests that parse connector manifest files and assert their structure, required fields, and data types.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define unit test framework for manifests.
- [ ] Write test cases for valid manifests.
- [ ] Write test cases for invalid manifests.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a connector manifest, when unit tests are run, then they pass for valid manifests and fail for invalid ones.
- Metrics/SLO: Unit tests complete within 100ms.
- Tests: Unit tests pass.
- Observability: N/A

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: None

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Unit test strategy for connector manifests approved.
- DOD: Tests implemented, documentation updated.
