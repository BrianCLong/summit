Excerpt/why: "Policy regressions â†’ contract tests w/ policy fixtures"

### Problem / Goal
Develop contract tests that use predefined policy fixtures to prevent policy regressions.

### Proposed Approach
Create a suite of automated tests that validate the behavior of policies against a set of known good inputs and expected outputs, ensuring that changes to policies do not introduce unintended regressions.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define policy contract test cases.
- [ ] Create policy fixtures (input/output pairs).
- [ ] Implement contract test framework.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a policy change, when contract tests are run, then they pass, ensuring no regressions in policy behavior.
- Metrics/SLO: Contract tests complete within 5 minutes.
- Tests: Contract tests pass.
- Observability: Contract test results visible in CI/CD pipeline.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: All relevant policies.
- Compliance: Ensures policy consistency and prevents unintended access changes.

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [policy] Implement ABAC/OPA policies for policy-gateway

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Policy contract test strategy approved.
- DOD: Tests implemented, documentation updated.
