### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star - Success at Sprint End
Excerpt/why: "Policies (ABAC/OPA) are enforced for CRUD and execution."

### Problem / Goal
Apply ABAC/OPA policies to workflow execution requests.

### Proposed Approach
Integrate OPA policy checks into the API endpoints responsible for triggering workflow executions, ensuring that only authorized users can initiate workflows based on their attributes and resource policies.

### Tasks
- [ ] Identify workflow execution API endpoints.
- [ ] Implement OPA policy checks for execution requests.
- [ ] Define ABAC policies for workflow execution.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a user attempts to execute a workflow, when policies are enforced, then access is correctly granted or denied based on ABAC rules.
- Metrics/SLO: Policy checks add minimal overhead to execution requests.
- Tests: Unit tests for policy enforcement, integration tests for API access control.
- Observability: Logs for policy decisions.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: ABAC policies for workflow execution.
- Compliance: Ensures secure and compliant initiation of workflows.

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [policy] Implement ABAC/OPA policies for policy-gateway

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Workflow execution policy enforcement design approved.
- DOD: Policies implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
