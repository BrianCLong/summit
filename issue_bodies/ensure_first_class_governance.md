### Context

Excerpt/why: "Firstâ€‘class governance, provenance, and policy."

### Problem / Goal
Integrate governance principles deeply into the Maestro Composer workflow service, ensuring compliance and control throughout the workflow lifecycle.

### Proposed Approach
Embed governance rules and checks directly into workflow definition, validation, and execution processes, leveraging policy engines like OPA.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define governance requirements for workflows.
- [ ] Integrate governance checks into workflow lifecycle.
- [ ] Document governance enforcement points.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a workflow action, when governance policies are applied, then compliance is enforced and violations are logged.
- Metrics/SLO: Governance checks add minimal overhead to workflow operations.
- Tests: Policy unit tests, E2E tests for governance enforcement.
- Observability: Governance-related events logged.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ | WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: All relevant governance policies.
- Compliance: Ensures regulatory and internal policy adherence.

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [policy] Implement ABAC/OPA policies for policy-gateway

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Governance integration design approved.
- DOD: Policies implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
