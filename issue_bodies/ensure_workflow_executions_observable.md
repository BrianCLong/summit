### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star - Success at Sprint End
Excerpt/why: "Executions are ... observable ..."

### Problem / Goal
Implement tracing, metrics, and logging to provide comprehensive visibility into workflow executions.

### Proposed Approach
Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, Prometheus for metrics collection (RED methodology), and structured logging for detailed event capture throughout the workflow execution lifecycle.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement OTEL tracing for workflow executions.
- [ ] Implement Prometheus metrics for workflow executions.
- [ ] Implement structured logging for workflow events.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a workflow execution, when observed, then its state, step timeline, and detailed logs are accessible and traceable.
- Metrics/SLO: Observability data collection adds no more than 5% overhead to execution time.
- Tests: Unit tests for instrumentation, E2E tests for observability data integrity.
- Observability: Dashboards show real-time execution status.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [audit-telemetry] Implement OTEL tracing across API, queue, and worker, [audit-telemetry] Implement Prometheus metrics (RED) for Maestro Composer

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Observability design approved.
- DOD: Instrumentation implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
