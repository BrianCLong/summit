### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star - Success at Sprint End
Excerpt/why: "smoke & k6 perf tests pass"

### Problem / Goal

Develop k6 scripts for performance testing the Maestro Composer backend, including enqueue and step handler latency.

### Proposed Approach

Create k6 test scenarios that simulate realistic loads on the workflow enqueue and step handler processes, measuring key performance indicators like p95 latency and throughput.

### Tasks

- [ ] Write k6 script for workflow enqueue.
- [ ] Write k6 script for step handler execution.
- [ ] Configure k6 test environment.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a performance test run, when k6 scripts are executed, then performance metrics meet defined SLOs (e.g., p95 enqueue < 300ms, p95 step handler < 1.5s).
- Metrics/SLO: k6 perf tests pass.
- Tests: k6 test runs.
- Observability: Performance test results integrated into dashboards.
