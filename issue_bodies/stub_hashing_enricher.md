### Context
Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 2) Scope (In) - Ingest Wizard v0.9 (MVP)
Excerpt/why: "enrichers stubbed: hashing"

### Problem / Goal
Create a stub for hashing enrichment in the streaming ETL path.

### Proposed Approach
Implement a placeholder module that simulates content hashing and adds dummy hash values to records in the streaming pipeline.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define hashing enrichment interface.
- [ ] Implement hashing enricher stub.
- [ ] Integrate stub into streaming ETL path.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given data with content flows through the ETL, when the hashing enricher stub is active, then dummy hash values are added to the records.
- Metrics/SLO: Hashing enricher stub adds no more than 10ms latency per record.
- Tests: Unit tests for stub functionality.
- Observability: Logs for enricher stub activity.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [data-platform] Develop streaming ETL path for ingest

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Enricher stub design approved.
- DOD: Code merged, tests pass, documentation updated.
