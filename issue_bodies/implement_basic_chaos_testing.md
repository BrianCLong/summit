### Context
Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 6) Work Breakdown (By Workstream) - DevEx / SRE
Excerpt/why: "basic chaos (kill one pod) without data loss"

### Problem / Goal
Introduce basic chaos engineering by simulating a single pod kill without data loss, verifying system resilience.

### Proposed Approach
Utilize a chaos engineering tool (e.g., Chaos Mesh, LitmusChaos) or direct Kubernetes commands to terminate a single pod and observe system behavior, ensuring data integrity.

### Tasks
- [ ] Select chaos engineering tool/method.
- [ ] Define target pod for termination.
- [ ] Implement data integrity checks post-termination.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a single pod is terminated during operation, when the system recovers, then no data loss occurs and services resume correctly.
- Metrics/SLO: Recovery time objective (RTO) < 5 minutes; recovery point objective (RPO) = 0.
- Tests: Chaos test runs.
- Observability: Logs for pod termination and recovery events.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A
