### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star - Success at Sprint End
Excerpt/why: "Executions are ... idempotent ... (exactlyâ€‘once semantics via idempotency keys + checkpointing)"

### Problem / Goal

Implement idempotency keys and mechanisms to prevent duplicate side-effects from retried workflow executions, ensuring exactly-once semantics.

### Proposed Approach

Design a system where each workflow execution or critical step is associated with a unique idempotency key, allowing the system to detect and safely ignore duplicate requests.

### Tasks

- [ ] Define idempotency key generation and storage.
- [ ] Implement idempotency checks at critical execution points.
- [ ] Ensure exactly-once semantics for side-effects.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a workflow execution is retried, when idempotency mechanisms are active, then no duplicate side-effects occur.
- Metrics/SLO: Idempotency checks add minimal overhead to execution latency.
- Tests: Unit tests for idempotency logic, E2E tests for retry scenarios.
- Observability: Logs for idempotency key usage.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: [orchestrator-core] Implement per-step checkpointing for workflow executions

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Idempotency design approved.
- DOD: Code merged, tests pass, documentation updated.
