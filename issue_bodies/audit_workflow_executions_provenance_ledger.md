### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star - Success at Sprint End
Excerpt/why: "audited in the provenance ledger."

### Problem / Goal

Integrate workflow execution details into the provenance ledger for comprehensive auditing.

### Proposed Approach

Extend the provenance ledger to accept and store detailed records of workflow executions, including inputs, decisions, outputs, and associated metadata.

### Tasks

- [ ] Define provenance schema for workflow executions.
- [ ] Implement data capture for execution details.
- [ ] Integrate with provenance ledger API for auditing.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a workflow execution, when completed, then a detailed audit record is generated and stored in the provenance ledger.
- Metrics/SLO: Auditing adds no more than 2% overhead to execution time.
- Tests: Unit tests for audit data capture, E2E tests for audit trail integrity.
- Observability: Audit logs are searchable and accessible.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A
- Compliance: Essential for accountability, regulatory compliance, and forensic analysis.

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: [data-platform] Integrate provenance for workflow execution evidence bundles

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Workflow auditing design approved.
- DOD: Auditing implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
