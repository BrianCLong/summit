### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 3) Nonâ€‘Functional Requirements - Security
Excerpt/why: "TLS only"

### Problem / Goal
Configure all network communication to use TLS encryption exclusively for Maestro Composer.

### Proposed Approach
Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher for all inbound and outbound network connections, including API endpoints, inter-service communication, and database connections.

### Tasks
- [ ] Configure TLS for API gateway.
- [ ] Configure TLS for inter-service communication.
- [ ] Configure TLS for database connections.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given any network communication, when inspected, then it is encrypted using TLS, and unencrypted connections are rejected.
- Metrics/SLO: TLS handshake latency adds minimal overhead.
- Tests: Security scans for unencrypted connections, integration tests for TLS enforcement.
- Observability: Logs for TLS connection attempts and failures.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: None

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: TLS enforcement design approved.
- DOD: TLS configured, tests pass, documentation updated.
