Excerpt/why: "preview env per PR."

### Problem / Goal
Set up automated preview environments for each pull request to facilitate testing and review.

### Proposed Approach
Integrate a CI/CD pipeline step that automatically deploys a temporary, isolated environment for each pull request, reflecting the changes introduced in that PR.

### Tasks
- [ ] Select preview environment tool/platform.
- [ ] Implement CI/CD step for preview environment deployment.
- [ ] Configure environment isolation and cleanup.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a new pull request is opened, when the CI/CD pipeline runs, then a dedicated preview environment is automatically deployed and accessible.
- Metrics/SLO: Preview environment deployment completes within 10 minutes.
- Tests: E2E tests run against preview environments.
- Observability: Preview environment URLs visible in PR status checks.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
