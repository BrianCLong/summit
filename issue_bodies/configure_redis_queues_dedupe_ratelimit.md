### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 1) Scope & Deliverables - 1.2 Data Model
Excerpt/why: "Redis: queues, dedupe keys (idempotency), rate limit buckets."

### Problem / Goal

Set up Redis to manage queues, store idempotency keys, and handle rate limiting for the Maestro Composer backend.

### Proposed Approach

Configure Redis instances and integrate client libraries within the application to utilize Redis for message queuing, storing unique idempotency tokens, and implementing token bucket algorithms for rate limiting.

### Tasks

- [ ] Configure Redis instance(s).
- [ ] Implement Redis-based queuing mechanism.
- [ ] Implement Redis-based idempotency key storage.
- [ ] Implement Redis-based rate limiting.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given Redis is configured, when workflows are enqueued, retried, or API calls are made, then Redis correctly manages queues, idempotency, and rate limits.
- Metrics/SLO: Redis operations p95 latency < 50ms.
- Tests: Unit and integration tests for Redis interactions.
- Observability: Redis metrics (e.g., queue depth, memory usage) visible in dashboards.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: [orchestrator-core] Design and implement core workflow/runbook authoring service

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Redis configuration design approved.
- DOD: Redis integrated, tests pass, documentation updated.
