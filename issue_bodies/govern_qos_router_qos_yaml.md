### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 1) Scope & Deliverables - 1.5 Observability & SRE
Excerpt/why: "QoS governed by `router/qos.yaml`"

### Problem / Goal

Configure the system to apply Quality of Service (QoS) rules defined in `router/qos.yaml`.

### Proposed Approach

Develop a configuration loader that reads QoS rules from `router/qos.yaml` and applies them to relevant components (e.g., API gateway, message queues) to prioritize traffic and manage resource allocation.

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement QoS configuration loader.
- [ ] Integrate QoS rules into API gateway.
- [ ] Integrate QoS rules into message queues.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given QoS rules are defined in `router/qos.yaml`, when traffic flows through the system, then QoS policies are correctly applied.
- Metrics/SLO: QoS enforcement adds minimal overhead.
- Tests: Unit tests for configuration parsing, integration tests for QoS enforcement.
- Observability: Metrics for QoS enforcement actions.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: READ | WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: None

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: QoS governance design approved.
- DOD: Code merged, tests pass, documentation updated.
