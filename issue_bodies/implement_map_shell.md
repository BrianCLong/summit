### Context
Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 2) Scope (In) - UI Shell: Triâ€‘Pane
Excerpt/why: "Graph + Timeline + Map shells"

### Problem / Goal
Develop the map visualization component within the Tri-Pane UI shell.

### Proposed Approach
Implement a React component for map rendering, integrating with a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox) to display geographical data.

### Tasks
- [ ] Select map visualization library.
- [ ] Implement basic map rendering.
- [ ] Integrate with data fetching for geographical entities.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given geographical data, when the Tri-Pane UI is loaded, then the Map shell displays entities on the map correctly.
- Metrics/SLO: Map rendering p95 latency < 500ms for 100 geographical points.
- Tests: Unit tests for map component, E2E test for map display.
- Observability: Logs for map rendering performance.
