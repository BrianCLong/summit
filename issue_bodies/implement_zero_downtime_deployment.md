### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star
Excerpt/why: "Zeroâ€‘downtime deploys."

### Problem / Goal
Develop and implement a deployment strategy that ensures no service interruption during updates for the Maestro Composer backend.

### Proposed Approach
Utilize blue/green deployment techniques or rolling updates with proper health checks and traffic shifting to achieve zero downtime during deployments.

### Tasks
- [ ] Research and select zero-downtime deployment strategy.
- [ ] Implement deployment pipeline for selected strategy.
- [ ] Configure health checks and traffic routing.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a new version of the backend is deployed, when traffic is shifted, then existing connections are maintained and new connections are routed to the new version without interruption.
- Metrics/SLO: Deployments complete with zero downtime.
- Tests: E2E tests for zero-downtime deployment.
- Observability: Metrics for deployment duration and success rate.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: DEPLOY
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [ci-cd] Develop Helm chart for Maestro Composer backend

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Zero-downtime deployment strategy approved.
- DOD: Deployment pipeline implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
