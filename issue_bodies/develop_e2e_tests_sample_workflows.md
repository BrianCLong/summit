### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 6) Test Plan - E2E
Excerpt/why: "sample workflows (routing, RAG, approval) from template → publish → simulate → execute."

### Problem / Goal
Create end-to-end tests that cover sample workflows from template creation to publishing, simulation, and execution.

### Proposed Approach
Develop automated E2E test scripts that simulate the full lifecycle of various sample workflows (e.g., routing, RAG, approval), asserting correctness at each stage.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define E2E test scenarios for sample workflows.
- [ ] Implement E2E test scripts for each scenario.
- [ ] Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given the E2E tests are executed, when sample workflows are processed, then they successfully complete their lifecycle from template to execution.
- Metrics/SLO: E2E tests complete within 10 minutes.
- Tests: E2E tests pass.
- Observability: E2E test results visible in CI/CD pipeline.
