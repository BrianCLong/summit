### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 3) Nonâ€‘Functional Requirements - Resilience
Excerpt/why: "graceful degradation"

### Problem / Goal
Design and implement mechanisms for Maestro Composer to maintain partial functionality under stress or failure conditions.

### Proposed Approach
Introduce circuit breakers, bulkheads, and fallback mechanisms for external dependencies and non-critical components, allowing core functionality to remain available even when parts of the system are impaired.

### Tasks
- [ ] Identify critical vs. non-critical functionalities.
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies.
- [ ] Design fallback mechanisms for non-critical components.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a critical dependency fails, when graceful degradation is active, then core Maestro Composer functionalities remain operational.
- Metrics/SLO: N/A
- Tests: Chaos tests simulating dependency failures.
- Observability: Metrics for circuit breaker states and fallback activations.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ | WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: None

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Graceful degradation design approved.
- DOD: Mechanisms implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
