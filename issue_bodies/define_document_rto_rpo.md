### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 3) Non‑Functional Requirements - Resilience
Excerpt/why: "RTO ≤ 1h, RPO ≤ 5m; DR docs"

### Problem / Goal

Establish and document Recovery Time Objective (RTO) ≤ 1h and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) ≤ 5m for Maestro Composer disaster recovery.

### Proposed Approach

Define a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, including data backup strategies, replication, failover procedures, and regular drills, to meet the specified RTO and RPO.

### Tasks

- [ ] Define DR strategy (backup, replication, failover).
- [ ] Implement DR infrastructure and processes.
- [ ] Document DR plan and runbooks.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a disaster recovery drill is performed, when measured, then the system recovers within 1 hour (RTO) with no more than 5 minutes of data loss (RPO).
- Metrics/SLO: RTO ≤ 1h, RPO ≤ 5m.
- Tests: DR drills.
- Observability: Metrics for recovery time and data loss during drills.

### Safety & Policy
