### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 1) Scope & Deliverables - 1.1 API Surface (v1) - Execution
Excerpt/why: "SSE channel `/api/executions/:id/stream`"

### Problem / Goal
Develop an SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint (`/api/executions/:id/stream`) for real-time streaming of execution logs.

### Proposed Approach
Implement an SSE endpoint that pushes log events for a specific workflow execution to connected clients in real-time, allowing for live monitoring of workflow progress.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define SSE endpoint for execution logs.
- [ ] Implement server-side SSE event pushing.
- [ ] Integrate with existing logging infrastructure.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a client connects to the SSE endpoint, when workflow logs are generated, then they are streamed in real-time to the client.
- Metrics/SLO: SSE log delivery p95 latency < 100ms.
- Tests: Unit tests for SSE logic, integration tests for real-time log delivery.
- Observability: Metrics for SSE connection count and event throughput.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [orchestrator-core] Implement API to get execution state, timeline, and logs (GET /api/executions/:id)

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: SSE log streaming design approved.
- DOD: Code merged, tests pass, documentation updated.
