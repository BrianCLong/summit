### Context

Source: `Autonomous Build Operator â€” Full Roadmap & Tuning Guide`, `INTELGRAPH_ENGINEERING_STANDARD_V4.md`
Excerpt/why: For any complex system, comprehensive documentation is crucial for operations, troubleshooting, and onboarding. This includes detailed runbooks for common procedures, clear explanations of operator configurations, and guides for using observability dashboards.

### Problem / Goal

As the orchestrator grows in complexity, the lack of up-to-date and comprehensive documentation becomes a significant operational risk. Operators may struggle to diagnose issues, configure the system correctly, or understand the meaning of metrics and alerts. The goal is to create and maintain high-quality documentation for runbooks, operator configurations, and observability dashboards.

### Proposed Approach

- Develop a standardized template for runbooks, covering common operational procedures (e.g., deployment, rollback, incident response, DR).
- Document all operator-facing configurations, explaining each parameter and its impact.
- Create guides for using the observability dashboards, explaining key metrics, how to interpret them, and what actions to take based on their values.
- Store all documentation in a version-controlled repository (e.g., Git) and integrate it with the CI/CD pipeline to ensure it is always up-to-date.
- Conduct regular reviews of the documentation to ensure accuracy and completeness.

### Tasks

- [ ] Define a documentation structure and tooling (e.g., Markdown, Sphinx).
- [ ] Create runbooks for core operational procedures (e.g., deployment, incident response).
- [ ] Document all operator-facing configuration parameters.
- [ ] Create guides for using the main observability dashboards.
- [ ] Integrate documentation updates into the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Schedule regular documentation review sessions.

### Acceptance Criteria

- All critical operational procedures are covered by a runbook.
- All operator configurations are clearly documented.
- Operators can effectively use the dashboards to diagnose and troubleshoot issues.
- Documentation is version-controlled and kept up-to-date with code changes.
- Metrics/SLO: Documentation completeness score > 90%; documentation review frequency: quarterly.
- Tests: N/A (documentation is validated by review and usability).
- Observability: N/A

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

- Depends on: #<id_of_observability_issue>, #<id_of_cicd_issue>
- Blocks: Operational readiness.

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Documentation plan and templates approved.
- DOD: Merged, documentation is published and accessible, review process is established.
