### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star - SLOs (initial)
Excerpt/why: "p95 `POST /api/workflows/:id/execute` < 300ms enqueue"

### Problem / Goal

Optimize workflow enqueue latency to achieve a p95 of less than 300ms for `POST /api/workflows/:id/execute`.

### Proposed Approach

Analyze the current enqueue process, identify bottlenecks (e.g., database writes, network calls, serialization), and implement optimizations such as asynchronous processing, batching, or faster data stores.

### Tasks

- [ ] Profile current enqueue latency.
- [ ] Identify and prioritize bottlenecks.
- [ ] Implement optimizations.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a workflow execution request, when `POST /api/workflows/:id/execute` is called, then the p95 enqueue latency is < 300ms.
- Metrics/SLO: p95 `POST /api/workflows/:id/execute` < 300ms enqueue.
- Tests: Performance tests using k6.
- Observability: Enqueue latency metrics visible in dashboards.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: [ci-cd] Implement k6 performance tests for Maestro Composer backend

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: Enqueue latency optimization plan approved.
- DOD: Optimizations implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
