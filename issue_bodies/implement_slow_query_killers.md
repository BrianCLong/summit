### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 1) Scope & Deliverables - 1.5 Observability & SRE
Excerpt/why: "slowâ€‘query/execution killers"

### Problem / Goal
Develop mechanisms to identify and terminate excessively long-running queries or workflow executions.

### Proposed Approach
Implement monitoring agents that track the duration of active queries and executions, and automatically trigger termination commands if predefined thresholds are exceeded.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define thresholds for slow queries/executions.
- [ ] Implement monitoring for query/execution duration.
- [ ] Implement termination logic for exceeding thresholds.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a query or execution exceeds its defined time limit, when the killer mechanism is active, then it is automatically terminated.
- Metrics/SLO: Termination occurs within 100ms of threshold breach.
- Tests: Unit tests for monitoring and termination logic, integration tests for killer effectiveness.
- Observability: Logs for terminated queries/executions.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
