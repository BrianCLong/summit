Excerpt/why: "secrets in vault"

### Problem / Goal

Store and retrieve all sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) from a secure vault solution.

### Proposed Approach

Integrate with a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and dynamically retrieve application secrets at runtime, avoiding hardcoded credentials.

### Tasks

- [ ] Select secrets management solution.
- [ ] Implement secrets retrieval client/library.
- [ ] Migrate existing secrets to the vault.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a service requires a secret, when it starts, then it retrieves the secret securely from the vault; no secrets are hardcoded in the codebase.
- Metrics/SLO: Secret retrieval p95 latency < 50ms.
- Tests: Unit tests for secret retrieval, integration tests for vault connectivity.
- Observability: Logs for secret access and rotation.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: READ | WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
