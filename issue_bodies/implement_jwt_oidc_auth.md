### Context

Excerpt/why: "JWT/OIDC auth"

### Problem / Goal

Integrate JWT/OIDC for user authentication and authorization in Maestro Composer.

### Proposed Approach

Implement an authentication middleware that validates JWTs issued by an OIDC provider, extracting user identity and claims for authorization decisions.

### Tasks

- [ ] Configure OIDC provider integration.
- [ ] Implement JWT validation middleware.
- [ ] Integrate with user context for authorization.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a user attempts to access a protected resource, when authenticated via JWT/OIDC, then access is granted based on valid tokens and denied otherwise.
- Metrics/SLO: Authentication p95 latency < 50ms.
- Tests: Unit tests for JWT validation, integration tests for authentication flow.
- Observability: Logs for authentication attempts and failures.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: READ | WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies

Blocks: None
Depends on: None

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: JWT/OIDC authentication design approved.
- DOD: Authentication implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
