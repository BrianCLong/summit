### Context

Source: `Autonomous Build Operator â€” Full Roadmap & Tuning Guide`
Excerpt/why: A disaster recovery (DR) plan is essential for system resilience. In the event of a catastrophic failure, we must be able to restore the orchestrator's state and all associated artifacts (like code, test results, and build logs) from a secure backup.

### Problem / Goal

The system currently has no backup or disaster recovery mechanism. A total failure of the primary database or storage would result in a complete loss of data and operational history. The goal is to implement a reliable DR process that includes regular backups, signed artifacts, and a tested restoration procedure.

### Proposed Approach

- Implement a daily backup job for the PostgreSQL database.
- All build artifacts and logs will be stored in a versioned, replicated object store (like AWS S3).
- Each artifact will be signed using a cryptographic key (e.g., via Sigstore) to ensure its integrity and provenance.
- A restore procedure will be documented and automated as a script. This script will restore the database from a snapshot and verify the integrity of all artifacts.
- The DR process will be tested quarterly in a dedicated environment.

### Tasks

- [ ] Set up automated daily backups for the PostgreSQL database.
- [ ] Integrate an object store for artifact storage.
- [ ] Implement artifact signing using a tool like Sigstore.
- [ ] Develop an automated restoration script.
- [ ] Document the full backup and restore procedure in a runbook.
- [ ] Create a dedicated DR testing environment.
- [ ] Perform the first successful DR drill.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a simulated catastrophic failure, the system can be restored to a consistent state within a 4-hour Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
- The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) must be no more than 24 hours.
- All restored artifacts must have a valid cryptographic signature.
- Metrics/SLO: MTTR (Mean Time To Recover) for DR drills < 4 hours.
- Tests: Quarterly DR drills must pass successfully.
- Observability: Alerts for backup failures; logs for all backup and restore operations.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: DEPLOY (restoring the system is a deployment action)
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: Access to the backup and restore mechanism must be highly restricted.

### Dependencies

- Depends on: #<id_of_durable_store_issue>
- Blocks: Production deployment (GA).

### DOR / DOD

- DOR: DR plan and architecture approved.
- DOD: Merged, first DR drill successful, runbook is complete.
