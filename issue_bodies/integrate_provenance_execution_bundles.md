Excerpt/why: "Provenance integration with `prov-ledger`: ... (b) execution evidence bundle (inputs, decisions, outputs) with license & reason‑for‑access."

### Problem / Goal
Register workflow execution evidence bundles (inputs, decisions, outputs) with license and reason-for-access in the `prov-ledger`.

### Proposed Approach
At the completion of a workflow execution, compile an evidence bundle containing all relevant execution details and metadata, and send it to the `prov-ledger` for immutable storage.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define evidence bundle structure for executions.
- [ ] Implement evidence bundle compilation at execution end.
- [ ] Integrate with `prov-ledger` API to register bundles.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a workflow execution completes, when the process finishes, then its evidence bundle is successfully registered in the `prov-ledger` with license and reason-for-access.
- Metrics/SLO: Provenance registration adds no more than 100ms to execution completion latency.
- Tests: Unit tests for bundle compilation, integration tests for `prov-ledger` integration.
- Observability: Logs for provenance registration events.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A
- Compliance: Ensures auditability and traceability of workflow executions.

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [data-platform] Implement evidence registration in prov-ledger service

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Provenance integration for execution bundles design approved.
- DOD: Code merged, tests pass, documentation updated.
