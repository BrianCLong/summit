### Context
Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 6) Work Breakdown (By Workstream) - DevEx / SRE
Excerpt/why: "Golden fixtures"

### Problem / Goal
Develop a set of golden fixtures for testing ingest mappings and NL→Cypher generation.

### Proposed Approach
Create stable, versioned data sets and expected outputs that serve as ground truth for automated tests, ensuring consistency across development cycles.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define golden fixture data format.
- [ ] Create initial golden fixtures for ingest.
- [ ] Create initial golden fixtures for NL→Cypher.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a test run, when golden fixtures are used, then tests are deterministic and reliable.
- Metrics/SLO: N/A
- Tests: Golden fixture validation tests.
- Observability: N/A

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [data-platform] Implement CSV/JSON upload for Ingest Wizard, [orchestrator-core] Implement NL → Cypher generation

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Golden fixture strategy approved.
- DOD: Fixtures created, documentation updated.
