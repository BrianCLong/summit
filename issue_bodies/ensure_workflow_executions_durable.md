### Context

Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star - Success at Sprint End
Excerpt/why: "Executions are durable ... 0 data loss on worker crash"

### Problem / Goal

Implement mechanisms to ensure workflow executions persist across system failures, guaranteeing 0 data loss on worker crash.

### Proposed Approach

Utilize persistent storage for workflow state and execution progress, combined with robust recovery mechanisms that can resume executions from the last known good state.

### Tasks

- [ ] Design durable storage for workflow state.
- [ ] Implement state persistence during execution.
- [ ] Develop recovery logic for crashed workers.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a worker crashes during workflow execution, when the system recovers, then the workflow resumes from its last state with no data loss.
- Metrics/SLO: 0 data loss on worker crash.
- Tests: Chaos tests simulating worker crashes.
- Observability: Metrics for recovery time and data integrity.

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A
