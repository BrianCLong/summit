### Context

Source: SPRINT_PROVENANCE_FIRST.md - 10) Risks & Mitigations
Excerpt/why: "telemetry sanity checks"

### Problem / Goal

Establish telemetry sanity checks to detect potential data poisoning attempts or anomalies in data flow.

### Proposed Approach

Implement automated checks on telemetry data (e.g., ingest rates, data distributions, error patterns) to identify deviations that might indicate data poisoning or system compromise.

### Tasks

- [ ] Identify key telemetry metrics for sanity checks.
- [ ] Implement automated anomaly detection on telemetry.
- [ ] Configure alerts for detected anomalies.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a data poisoning attempt or anomaly occurs, when telemetry sanity checks are active, then an alert is triggered, indicating a potential issue.
- Metrics/SLO: Anomaly detection p95 latency < 5 minutes.
- Tests: Unit tests for anomaly detection logic.
- Observability: Telemetry sanity check results integrated into dashboards.
