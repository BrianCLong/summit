### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 6) Test Plan - Integration
Excerpt/why: "supertest API suite"

### Problem / Goal
Create an integration test suite using Supertest for all Maestro Composer APIs.

### Proposed Approach
Develop a comprehensive test suite using Supertest that makes HTTP requests to the Maestro Composer APIs and asserts on their responses, covering various scenarios and edge cases.

### Tasks
- [ ] Set up Supertest framework.
- [ ] Write integration tests for core API endpoints.
- [ ] Cover CRUD, execution, and analytics APIs.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given the Maestro Composer backend is running, when the Supertest API suite is executed, then all API endpoints function as expected and tests pass.
- Metrics/SLO: Supertest suite completes within 10 minutes.
- Tests: Integration tests pass.
- Observability: Test results visible in CI/CD pipeline.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: READ | WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [orchestrator-core] Design and implement core workflow/runbook authoring service

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Supertest API suite strategy approved.
- DOD: Tests implemented, documentation updated.
