Excerpt/why: "Budgets/Backpressure: token buckets per tenant"

### Problem / Goal
Develop a token bucket mechanism to enforce per-tenant budgets and manage backpressure.

### Proposed Approach
Implement a token bucket algorithm that limits the rate of operations or resource consumption for each tenant, and integrate it at the API gateway or service entry points.

### Tasks
- [ ] Design token bucket algorithm for per-tenant limits.
- [ ] Implement token bucket enforcement.
- [ ] Integrate with API gateway/service entry points.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a tenant exceeds its budget, when requests are made, then the token bucket mechanism correctly applies backpressure or rejects requests.
- Metrics/SLO: Token bucket checks add minimal overhead to request latency.
- Tests: Unit tests for token bucket logic, integration tests for backpressure enforcement.
- Observability: Metrics for token bucket status and rejected requests.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A
