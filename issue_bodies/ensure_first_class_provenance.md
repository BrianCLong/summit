### Context
Source: SPRINT_MAESTRO_COMPOSER_BACKEND.md - 0) North Star
Excerpt/why: "Firstâ€‘class governance, provenance, and policy."

### Problem / Goal
Integrate provenance tracking deeply into the Maestro Composer workflow service, ensuring auditability and traceability for all workflow actions.

### Proposed Approach
Design and implement mechanisms to capture and record detailed provenance information (e.g., who, what, when, why, how) for every step and decision within a workflow execution.

### Tasks
- [ ] Define provenance data model for workflows.
- [ ] Implement provenance capture points in workflow engine.
- [ ] Integrate with provenance ledger for storage.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given a workflow execution, when completed, then a comprehensive provenance record is generated and stored in the provenance ledger.
- Metrics/SLO: Provenance capture adds no more than 5% overhead to workflow execution time.
- Tests: Unit tests for provenance capture, E2E tests for provenance integrity.
- Observability: Provenance-related events logged.

### Safety & Policy
- Action class: WRITE
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A
- Compliance: Essential for audit trails, accountability, and regulatory compliance.

### Dependencies
Blocks: None
Depends on: [data-platform] Implement evidence registration in prov-ledger service

### DOR / DOD
- DOR: Provenance integration design approved.
- DOD: Provenance implemented, tests pass, documentation updated.
