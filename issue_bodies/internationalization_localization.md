### Context

Source: `docs/CONDUCTOR_PRD_v1.0.md`, `docs/ChatOps/define full specs and requirements documents and architectural documentation to develop an improved wvolution of a maltego_Palantir synthesis.md`, `docs/ChatOps/intel_graph_front_end_product_specification_v_1.md`, `docs/ChatOps/intel_graph_ui_architecture_component_outline_v_1.md`
Excerpt/why: The project aims for global usability, requiring comprehensive internationalization and localization. This includes multilingual UI and NLP support, locale-aware formatting for dates, times, and numbers, and adherence to accessibility standards like WCAG 2.1 AA for localized content.

### Problem / Goal

The current system may not adequately support multiple languages, regional formats, or cultural nuances, limiting its global reach and usability. Without a robust i18n/l10n strategy, the product will struggle to penetrate international markets and serve diverse user bases effectively. The goal is to implement comprehensive internationalization and localization, ensuring the UI and content are adaptable to various locales.

### Proposed Approach

- **Core i18n Framework:** Integrate a robust i18n library (e.g., `react-i18next`, `FormatJS`) for managing translations and locale-specific formatting.
- **Translation Management:** Establish a process for managing translation keys and content, potentially using a translation management system (TMS).
- **Locale-Aware Formatting:** Ensure all dates, times, numbers, and currencies are displayed according to the user's locale.
- **Multilingual UI:** Enable the UI to switch between supported languages dynamically.
- **NLP Localization:** Investigate and implement multilingual support for NLP components (e.g., entity extraction, sentiment analysis).
- **RTL Support:** Design and implement UI components to support Right-to-Left (RTL) languages where applicable.
- **Accessibility for Localized Content:** Ensure WCAG compliance extends to localized content, including proper handling of text expansion, font rendering, and screen reader narratives in different languages.

### Tasks

- [ ] Select and integrate an i18n framework into the frontend and backend.
- [ ] Define a translation key structure and establish a translation workflow.
- [ ] Implement locale-aware formatting for dates, times, numbers, and currencies.
- [ ] Develop UI language switching functionality.
- [ ] Research and integrate multilingual models for NLP components.
- [ ] Implement RTL support for UI layouts.
- [ ] Conduct accessibility audits specifically for localized content.
- [ ] Document i18n/l10n guidelines for developers and content creators.

### Acceptance Criteria

- The UI can be switched to at least two additional languages (e.g., Spanish, German) with all visible strings translated.
- Dates, times, and numbers are displayed correctly according to the selected locale.
- NLP components demonstrate reasonable performance and accuracy in supported non-English languages.
- The UI renders correctly in RTL mode for supported languages.
- Accessibility audits confirm WCAG compliance for localized content.
- Metrics/SLO: Translation coverage > 95% for supported languages; localization-related bugs < 0.5% of total bugs.
- Tests: Automated tests for locale-aware formatting; manual review of translated UI.
- Observability: N/A

### Safety & Policy

- Action class: N/A (UI/UX improvement)
- OPA rule(s) evaluated: N/A
