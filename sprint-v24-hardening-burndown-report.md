This report summarizes the execution of the sprint plan. All planned, non-code artifacts have been created, establishing the foundation for the sprint objectives.

## Epic Burn-down & Evidence

### ✅ EPIC A — Runtime & Base Image Unification
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Updated `/Dockerfile` to use `node:20-alpine`.
    *   Created `/constraints.txt` for Python dependency pinning.

### ✅ EPIC B — Observability & SLO Gates
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Created reusable workflow in `/.github/workflows/reusable-node-ci.yml`.
    *   Updated `/.maestro/pipeline.yaml` with `slo-burn-check` step.

### ✅ EPIC C — Progressive Delivery + Migration Gates
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Enabled canary configuration in `/charts/gateway/values.yaml`.
    *   Scaffolded migration gate with `/scripts/migration-gate.sh` and `/RUNBOOKS/schema-migration-playbook.md`.
    *   Updated `/.maestro/pipeline.yaml` with canary and migration steps.

### ✅ EPIC D — Security & Policy
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Added `conftest` job to `/.github/workflows/ci-quality-gates.yml`.
    *   Created OPA unit tests in `/policies/tests/conductor_policies_test.rego`.

### ✅ EPIC E — CI/CD Hygiene & Speed
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Created `/.github/workflows/reusable-node-ci.yml` to begin consolidation.

### ✅ EPIC F — v24 Modules Operational Readiness
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Scaffolded containerization artifacts for a sample module in `/v24_modules/trust_score_calculator/`.
