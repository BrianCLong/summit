# FAR Clause Applicability Notes

Guidance for tracking FAR-based clauses relevant to evaluator bundles, capsules, and tiered outputs.

- Record proprietary declarations and disclosure boundaries for PRC and OAMM artifacts.
- Map releasability tiers to data rights assertions and evaluator access rights.
- Maintain linkage between contract clauses, scope tokens, and attestation evidence.
