# OA/MOSA Self-Score

This self-score template aligns to interoperability, composability, and rights
markings expected in MOSA-style evaluations.

## Score Categories

1. **Interoperability**: ICDs are versioned, testable, and evaluator-run.
2. **Composability**: Capsules and components declare effect types and contracts.
3. **Reusability**: Conformance suite validates reuse without performer assistance.
4. **Maintainability**: Deprecation timelines and adapters are documented.
5. **Extensibility**: Tech insertion points are defined with conformance tests.

## Evidence Artifacts

- ICD + conformance suite bundle
- Rights assertion artifact
- Transparency log receipts
