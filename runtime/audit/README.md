# Model Execution Audit Logs

This directory contains append-only audit logs for local model execution.

- `*.jsonl`: Structured logs capturing stdout/stderr, resource usage, and security events (e.g., egress attempts).

Audit logs are used for incident response and real-time monitoring of hardened model sandboxes.
