# Next Codex Prompts

## Binary Search Tree Implementation (JavaScript)
- **Role**: Expert software engineer.
- **Task**: Implement a binary search tree (BST) in JavaScript with methods to insert a node, search for a value, and traverse the tree in-order.
- **Language**: JavaScript.
- **Constraints**:
  - Use ES6 class syntax.
  - Include inline comments explaining each method.
  - Write a small demo at the bottom that builds a tree and prints the in-order traversal.
- **Output**: Provide only the code, no explanations.

## Concurrency with Async/Await (JavaScript)
- **Role**: Expert software engineer.
- **Goal**: Demonstrate advanced concurrency patterns using `async`/`await` with practical examples (parallel execution, throttling, error handling, cancellation semantics where supported).
- **Expectations**:
  - Use modern JavaScript runtime APIs like `Promise.allSettled`, `AbortController`, and `AsyncGenerator` patterns.
  - Show structured logging for task lifecycles and clear error propagation strategies.
  - Include notes on testing strategies for concurrent workflows.

## Real-World Utility: CSV Parsing (JavaScript)
- **Role**: Expert software engineer.
- **Goal**: Provide a production-ready CSV parsing utility with streaming support.
- **Expectations**:
  - Use a streaming parser to handle large files without exhausting memory.
  - Demonstrate schema validation and graceful error reporting for malformed rows.
  - Include examples for both file-based and in-memory string parsing, with conversion to JSON objects.
  - Outline how to integrate the parser into data pipelines and testing considerations (golden files, property-based tests for edge cases).
