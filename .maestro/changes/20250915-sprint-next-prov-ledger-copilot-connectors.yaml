objective: >
  Ship Prov-Ledger beta with verifiable export manifests, raise NL→Cypher validity to ≥95%,
  certify 5 priority connectors with golden IO tests, and stand up SLO dashboards + cost guards.
  Deliver one productionized runbook (R2: Phishing Cluster Discovery) and manifest-verified exports.

rationale:
  - Aligns to near-term roadmap: Core GA slices + Prov-Ledger beta + Ops (SLO dashboards, cost guards) + connectors.
  - Meets explicit acceptances for NL Graph Querying (≥95% syntactic validity).
  - Connector pack ships with manifest+mapping, rate-limit policy, sample data, golden IO tests.
  - Ops/SRE targets and artifacts are spelled out (SLOs p95, OTEL/Prom, cost guard, chaos drills).
  - Collaboration/export flows validate via manifest verifier.

budgets:
  p95_ms_graph_read: 1500   # p95 graph query < 1.5s target (3 hops, 50k nodes).
  ingestion_10k_docs_minutes: 5
  ci_hard_cap_usd: 25        # conform to .maestro/pipeline.yaml budgets
  daily_infra_usd: 50        # mirrors .orchestra.env baseline

work_items:
  - epic: Provenance & Claim Ledger (beta)
    repo: prov-ledger/*
    stories:
      - "Implement export manifest (hash tree + transform chain) and external verifier CLI."
      - "Expose /export/prov and /claims/* endpoints behind auth; add /healthz,/readyz,/metrics."
      - "Wire disclosure bundles in apps/web to attach manifest on export."
    acceptance:
      - "Export produces verifiable manifest (hash tree, transform chain) and passes external verifier."
      - "Disclosure exports validate via manifest verifier in UI flow."
      - "API surface documented and probed in CI (healthz/readyz/metrics present)."

  - epic: NL→Cypher Copilot hardening (apps/web + server)
    stories:
      - "Improve prompt→generated Cypher preview; add cost/row estimate panel and sandbox exec diff vs manual."
      - "Add rollback/undo and regression suite of 200 prompts."
    acceptance:
      - "≥95% syntactic validity on test prompts; rollback/undo supported."

  - epic: Connector Pack v1 (5 connectors)
    connectors: [stix_taxii_connector, splunk_connector, sentinel_connector, csv_connector, elasticsearch_connector]
    stories:
      - "Each ships manifest+mapping, rate-limit policy, sample dataset, golden IO tests."
      - "Docs include Hello World and mapping examples."
    acceptance:
      - "All 5 connectors meet connector acceptance incl. golden IO tests."
      - "Integration conformance tests + 'hello world' flows documented."

  - epic: Ops & SRE Enablement (SLOs + Cost Guard + Telemetry)
    stories:
      - "Instrument OTEL traces + Prom metrics across web/server/prov-ledger."
      - "Implement cost guard (query budgeter + slow-query killer) with alerting."
      - "Publish SLO dashboards (p95 graph query, ingest E2E) and run one chaos drill."
    acceptance:
      - "SLOs: p95 graph query <1.5s; ingest 10k docs in <5m; dashboards live."
      - "Cost guard active with budgets + alerts; one chaos drill executed with report."

  - epic: Runbook into Prod (R2 Phishing Cluster Discovery)
    stories:
      - "Automate steps: parse headers → SPF/DKIM → CT logs/DNS clustering → entity consolidation → disclosure pack."
      - "Attach provenance manifests to evidence bundle."
    acceptance:
      - "R2 runbook executes E2E; outputs disclosure pack with manifests."

  - epic: Governance & Security touchpoints
    stories:
      - "Enforce ABAC/RBAC via OPA; log reason-for-access; step-up auth where needed."
    acceptance:
      - "STRIDE controls mapped; no criticals outstanding before release."

definition_of_done:
  - Unit/contract tests for connectors & GraphQL schema; Cypher tests w/ ephemeral Neo4j.
  - E2E: ingest → resolve → runbook → report; UI screenshot diffs must pass.
  - OTEL/Prom telemetry visible; budgets and alerts configured; chaos drill report attached.
  - Tri-pane UI tasks show time-to-task reduction metric captured (TTFI/path discovery).

deliverables:
  - ghcr images: intelgraph-server, prov-ledger
  - docs: Connector How-Tos + Copilot UX notes + Prov-Ledger verifier README
  - dashboards: SLO (p95/p99, ingest E2E), Cost Guard
  - artifacts: R2 runbook playbook, chaos drill postmortem

owner_map:
  - DRI: eng-platform (ops, SLO, cost guard)
  - DRI: data-pipelines (connectors)
  - DRI: ai-copilot (NL→Cypher)
  - DRI: prov-ledger (service + verifier)
  - Support: web-ux, sre, docs

risks:
  - "Cypher validity plateau <95%" : "Expand prompt set + add syntax repair stage."
  - "Connector rate limiting blocks tests" : "Use sample datasets + local stubs."
  - "SLO target misses" : "Scope back to 3 hops/50k nodes & cache tuning per plan."
