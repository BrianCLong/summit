# GA Evidence Dashboard

Deterministic, auditor-grade snapshot of build verification and golden-path provenance.

## Core Subjects

| Subject | Path | SHA256 |
|---|---|---|
| provenance | provenance.json | 6da1292aa90b09df13f0c6bb36eff593540d974c4b9b4030fb147fa129e1b234 |

## Verify Lanes Summary

| Lane | Artifacts | Rollup SHA256 |
|---|---:|---|

## Evidence Manifest Totals

Subjects: 1

Verify artifacts: 0

All evidence items: 1

## Attestation Target

The build provenance attestation is bound to:

- provenance.json (sha256: 6da1292aa90b09df13f0c6bb36eff593540d974c4b9b4030fb147fa129e1b234)

## Notes

- No timestamps are included in this dashboard or its upstream JSON artifacts.
- All lists are codepoint-sorted to prevent locale variance.
- Rollup digests are deterministic “digest-of-digests” over lane artifact paths + SHA256.
