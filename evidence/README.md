# Evidence Bundle

This directory contains deterministic evidence artifacts generated by
`summit_evidence.write_bundle`. Only `stamp.json` may include timestamps.

## Schemas
- `schemas/evidence/report.schema.json`: Schema for the main evidence report.
- `schemas/evidence/metrics.schema.json`: Schema for metrics collected during execution.
- `schemas/evidence/stamp.schema.json`: Schema for the attestation stamp (versions, time).
- `schemas/evidence/index.schema.json`: Schema for the index file mapping IDs to artifacts.

## Usage
Run `tools/ci/verify_bundle.py` to validate generated evidence against these schemas.

## Schema Validation

Validate these files against `schemas/evidence/*.schema.json`.
