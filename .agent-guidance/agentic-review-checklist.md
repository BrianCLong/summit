# Agentic Review Checklist

When reviewing code generated by agents (LLMs), apply the "External Contributor" mindset.

## 1. Safety & Security
- [ ] **Secrets:** Did the agent hardcode any credentials?
- [ ] **Deps:** Did it hallucinate any npm packages?
- [ ] **Sanitization:** Are inputs validated?

## 2. Logic & Correctness
- [ ] **Loop:** Did the agent create infinite loops?
- [ ] **Types:** Are types loose (`any`) where they should be strict?
- [ ] **Tests:** Do the new tests actually test the logic (or just mock everything)?

## 3. Governance
- [ ] **Plan:** Does `PLAN.md` match the PR content?
- [ ] **Drift:** Did the agent modify files outside the plan?
