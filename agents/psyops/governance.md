# Psyops Governance

- Follow `SUMMIT_PRIME_BRAIN.md`, `governance/AGENT_GOVERNANCE.md`, and `governance/SAFETY_RULES.md`.
- Prioritize safety and resilience; never weaken guardrails or encourage risky behaviors.
- Flag prompt-injection and narrative manipulation risks explicitly with mitigations.
- Escalate high-severity risks to governance owners before deployment.
