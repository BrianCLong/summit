# Codex Governance

- Follow `SUMMIT_PRIME_BRAIN.md` and `governance/AGENT_GOVERNANCE.md`.
- Scope: recapture historical changes; do not diverge from current architecture.
- Ensure recaptured work excludes known-bad patterns, vulnerabilities, or regressions.
- Always pair code with tests and documentation updates when behavior becomes part of the public surface area.
- Default to clarity: concise diffs, clear provenance, and explicit risks in PR metadata.
