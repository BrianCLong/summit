## 🔧 Technical Debt & Dependencies

### **Major Version Conflicts**
1. **OpenTelemetry API**:
   - Current: v1.9.0
   - Required: <1.8.0 (multiple SDK packages)
   - Impact: Peer dependency warnings, potential runtime issues

2. **React Ecosystem (Mobile Interface)**:
   - React Native expects React 19.x
   - Currently: React 18.3.1
   - Impact: React Three Fiber, Storybook compatibility

3. **GraphQL Codegen**:
   - Package corruption in cosmiconfig dependency
   - Impact: GraphQL type generation failing
   - Status: Requires clean install

### **Deprecated Dependencies**
- **Apollo Server v3/v4**: End-of-life packages (36 found)
- **ESLint v8**: Deprecated but stable
- **Various @types packages**: Stub definitions available in main packages
