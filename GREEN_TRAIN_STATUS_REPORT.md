### 📦 Priority PR Inventory

| PR / Branch                    | Area         | Gate Blocker              | Risk Profile             | Merge Path                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| #972 `feat/schema-contract-v2` | API / Server | Typecheck + schema diff   | Medium — GraphQL clients | Merge queue after regenerated types          |
| #975 `fix/e2e-checkout`        | Client / QA  | E2E flake mitigation      | Low — selector stability | Merge immediately after green e2e            |
| #981 `feat/invoice-otel`       | Server       | Awaiting OTEL span review | Low — observability only | Merge queue once spans validated             |
| #987 `chore/pnpm-9.12`         | Tooling      | None (all green)          | Low — lockfile churn     | Ready for queue, schedule during low traffic |

### ⚠️ Risk Watchlist

- **Schema Contract Drift:** Clients on `services/mobile-api` need compatibility layer once `feat/schema-contract-v2` lands. Release captain to confirm contract tests.
- **Redis Healthcheck Flake:** Integration suite occasionally fails; root cause under investigation with Infra + Test Eng pairing.
- **Playwright Checkout Flow:** Known flaky selectors; `fix/e2e-checkout` PR introduces stable data-test ids and retry logic. Block merges touching checkout until green run confirmed.
- **Node Environment Variance:** Local devs on Node 18 hit `pnpm install` issues — communicate requirement to upgrade to Node 20.11.x before contributing.

### ✅ Merge-Train Action Log

- [x] Confirmed merge queue alignment with `.github/protection-rules.yml`.
- [x] Ensured preview environment workflow responsive for every PR in queue.
- [ ] Regenerate GraphQL types post `feat/schema-contract-v2` rebase.
- [ ] Publish Redis healthcheck fix guidance to `RUNBOOK_MERGE_TRAIN.md`.
- [ ] Attach canary + rollback notes to all high-risk PR descriptions.

### 🔄 Execution Notes

- Continue processing PRs oldest-first unless dependency chain dictates otherwise; use `/rebase` bot command where available.
- Feature-flag all risky runtime changes; default to **off** with documented enablement steps.
- For infra-touching branches, capture Terraform plan summaries and attach to PR comment for reviewer quick scan.
- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` fragments for every user-facing fix to keep release notes synchronized.

### **P2 - Standard (Next Week)**
