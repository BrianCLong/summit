# Orchestrator & Maestro Ecosystem Superset Capabilities

## Purpose
This document defines the feature set and execution roadmap required for Maestro Conductor, Composer, CompanyOS, Switchboard, Build Platform/Plane, Intelgraph, and allied Summit orchestrator surfaces to outperform and subsume the combined strengths of contemporary developer co-pilots (Aider, Cursor, Devin, Codex, Comet Browser, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.).

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Capability Parity and Surpass** – Implement every core function observed in leading code co-pilots, then extend beyond parity with differentiated automation, reasoning, and guardrails.
2. **Unified DevEx Fabric** – Provide a single cognitive operating system that spans planning, authoring, testing, deployment, observability, governance, and human feedback loops.
3. **Resilience & Trust** – Deliver transparent provenance, verifiable execution, policy enforcement, safety boundaries, and measurable reliability.
4. **Continuous Intelligence** – Fuse telemetry, product analytics, knowledge graphs, and workforce feedback into a living intelligence layer that continuously improves orchestration outcomes.

## Capability Pillars
### 1. Cognitive Development Environment (CDE)
- Multimodal pair-programming agents with inline refactors, explanations, and automatic diff validation.
- Workspace-aware instruction following with persistent memory, context stitching across repos, and self-healing commands.
- Autonomous task decomposition and sprint alignment from natural-language goals.
- Browser-native runtime ("Comet++") with zero-install experiences and live collaboration sessions.

### 2. Enterprise DevOps Autopilot
- Declarative pipeline synthesis (CI/CD, policy as code, infrastructure-as-code) with compliance-aware templates.
- Self-tuning build plane that provisions compute, caches, and artifact routing based on workload predictions.
- Auto-remediation playbooks triggered by alerts or failing checks (build, security, performance).
- Risk-aware rollout orchestration with feature flags, canary scoring, and rollback heuristics.

### 3. Knowledge Fusion & Reasoning Graphs
- Intelgraph knowledge fabric unifying architecture docs, incident records, decision logs, and code semantics.
- Adaptive retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with policy-governed access control and lineage tracking.
- Temporal reasoning over commit histories, telemetry, and OKR progress for proactive recommendations.
- Multi-agent investigation teams for root cause analysis, speculative design reviews, and compliance evidence packs.

### 4. Trust, Safety, and Governance
- Always-on provenance capture (signing, SBOM, audit chains) for every automated action.
- Policy guardrails using Summit Governance DSL to enforce data handling, licensing, and export controls.
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints with explainable suggestions, rationale graphs, and override journaling.
- Embedded fairness, bias, and privacy diagnostics with remediation recipes.

### 5. Developer & Stakeholder Experience
- Role-adaptive UX: engineers, PMs, security, ops each receive tailored dashboards and copilots.
- Storybook-style UI surfaces for orchestration flows with accessibility-first design tokens.
- Integrated communication overlays (Switchboard) to sync updates, decisions, and task reprioritization.
- Gamified productivity analytics with burnout detection and sustainable velocity insights.

   - Open plugin ecosystem with verified extensions, marketplace telemetry, and revenue sharing.
   - Embed wellbeing analytics and adaptive workload balancing in CompanyOS.

## Current Capability Baseline (Evidence Check)
- **Maestro Conductor Core** – DAG execution, PostgreSQL state management, OPA policy enforcement, and OpenTelemetry/Prometheus observability already ship as production features, providing the control plane for autonomous workflows.【F:MAESTRO_PRODUCTION_READINESS.md†L5-L58】
- **Composer vNext Build Intelligence** – Remote caching, test impact analysis, signed provenance, and telemetry-rich explainability give the build system a measurable speed and reliability lead that the superset plan can extend.【F:COMPOSER_VNEXT.md†L1-L92】
- **Maestro Build Plane Delivery Fabric** – Hardened Docker templates, CI/CD with SBOM + Cosign, per-PR preview environments, and a real-time Build HUD ensure supply-chain security and release velocity foundations.【F:docs/maestro/BUILD_PLANE.md†L1-L77】
- **Switchboard & CompanyOS Experience Layer** – Local-first Switchboard blueprint delivers instant command palette access, multimodal collaboration, policy-guarded widgets, and encrypted PAN rooms, while the IntelGraph Symphony Orchestra stack already unifies LiteLLM routing, RAG, and agent roles for developers.【F:docs/modules/switchboard-blueprint.md†L1-L66】【F:docs/ORCHESTRA.md†L1-L90】
- **Intelgraph Knowledge Fabric Trajectory** – The conductor evolution strategy defines contextual intelligence, multi-source synthesis, and compliance-checked knowledge orchestration that the superset must operationalize end-to-end.【F:docs/CONDUCTOR_EVOLUTION_STRATEGY.md†L269-L316】
