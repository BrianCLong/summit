## Resolution Strategy
1. Manually review each conflicting file
2. Resolve conflicts by integrating changes appropriately
3. Test the integrated functionality
4. Commit the resolved merge

## Recommendation
For complex merges with unrelated histories, consider using a more targeted approach:
- Identify key features in the PR bundle
- Implement those features incrementally in the main codebase
- Validate each incremental change with tests
