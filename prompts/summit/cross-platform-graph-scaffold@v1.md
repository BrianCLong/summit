# Cross-Platform Graph Scaffold (Summit)

## Mission

Implement deterministic cross-platform graph primitives and a co-share similarity
builder with unit tests and minimal fixtures. Update roadmap status metadata.

## Constraints

- Keep changes scoped to Summit graph primitives, fixtures, tests, and docs.
- Deterministic outputs only; no nondeterministic serialization.
- Add/extend tests for new logic.
- Update docs/roadmap/STATUS.json with a revision note.

## Expected Outputs

- `summit/graph/model.py`
- `summit/graph/builders/coshare.py`
- `summit/graph/tests/*`
- `summit/graph/fixtures/*`
- `docs/cross_platform_graph.md`
- `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` update
