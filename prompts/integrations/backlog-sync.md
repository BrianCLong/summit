# Prompt: Integration Platform & Backlog Sync (Jira/Linear/GitHub)

Objective: Align Summit backlog metadata across Jira, Linear, and GitHub Projects for priority lanes.

Required outputs:

- Canonical inventory of Security Batch 1, IntelGraph → Maestro → CompanyOS critical path, and first OSINT vertical slice.
- Normalized metadata (title, priority, owner, status, PR links) and automation rules.
- Integration documentation updates under `docs/integrations/`.
- Integration verification updates under `scripts/`.
- Roadmap status metadata update in `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`.

Constraints:

- Keep changes within approved paths only.
- Follow governance and readiness assertions in `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md`.
- Provide deterministic identifiers and avoid placeholders.
