# Prompt: CAS Artifacts + Immutable Evidence

Implement a GA-grade content-addressable store (CAS) for governance/evidence
outputs. Provide a shared CAS library, add run manifests + stamps for evidence
and GA verification runs, add a verifier, wire CI enforcement, and document the
specification. Keep outputs deterministic and avoid new dependencies. Ensure
CAS integrity verification and local-only pruning controls.
