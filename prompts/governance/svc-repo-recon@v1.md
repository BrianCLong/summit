# Prompt: SVC Repo Recon (v1)

## Objective
Capture verified repository facts, deferred assumptions, and guardrails needed to introduce Summit Verified Change (SVC) with deterministic verification artifacts.

## Scope
- `repo_assumptions.md`
- `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`

## Constraints
- Evidence-first updates with citations.
- Do not modify policy-enforced CI gates or security baselines.
- Keep changes additive and reversible.

## Required Outputs
- Updated `repo_assumptions.md` with verified facts, deferred assumptions, must-not-touch list, and validation checklist.
- Updated `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` entry for the SVC recon task.
