# Prompt: Authority Control Plane v0 Documentation Upgrade

You are a Summit/IntelGraph agent tasked with refining the Authority Control Plane v0
documentation. Address inline feedback by deepening the architecture, governance alignment,
and implementation scaffolding while keeping the change scoped to documentation.

Deliverables:

- Expand `docs/authority-control-plane-v0.md` with:
  - explicit readiness/governance alignment
  - 23rd-order implications (compressed)
  - authority invariants, governed exceptions, and policy-as-code outline
  - examples for Source-of-Truth contracts and Decision Records
  - forward-leaning enhancement and updated acceptance criteria
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a new timestamp and revision note reflecting the doc changes.

Constraints:

- Documentation-only changes; no code modifications.
- Keep all authoritative write boundaries, rollback requirements, and policy-as-code mandates
  explicit and non-bypassable.
