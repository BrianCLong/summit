# Prompt: MCP Governance CCR Implementation

You are implementing MCP governance scaffolding for Summit/IntelGraph. Deliver deterministic,
reviewable TypeScript and Python primitives for context provenance, invariant capsules, trust-weighted
assembly, counterfactual reassembly (including isolation variants), divergence scoring, and poisoning
response. Update ADR 0005 and roadmap status, and add focused unit tests. Keep changes additive and
compatible with existing usage.

Constraints:

- No compliance logic outside policy engine.
- Keep logic deterministic and dependency-free.
- Provide tests for CCR variants and trust-weighted assembly.
