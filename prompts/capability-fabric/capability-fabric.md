# Summit Capability Fabric Build Prompt

Build a capability-centric API registry, discovery map, and enforcement firewall that prevents
agentic overreach by default. Implement a registry spec with schema validation, inventory scanning,
capability graph, risk scoring, diff reporting, runtime enforcement for MCP tool invocation, and
policy-gated decisions with deterministic artifacts. Provide CLI commands (`summitctl cap`) for
scan, validate, report, and register workflows. Ensure deny-by-default behavior for unregistered
capabilities, approvals required for restricted classifications, and auditable evidence outputs.
Document how to register capabilities and interpret risk reports.
