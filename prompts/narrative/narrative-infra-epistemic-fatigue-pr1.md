# Narrative Infra Epistemic Fatigue PR1 Prompt

## Objective
Deliver first-class narrative frame and infrastructure schemas with deterministic identifiers for GraphRAG narrative intelligence, plus unit tests proving deterministic hashing.

## Scope
- Add narrative frame and infrastructure schemas with typed fields for blame, inevitability, constraints, moral vocabulary, and causal templates.
- Provide deterministic id and infrastructure fingerprint generation with normalized inputs.
- Add unit tests validating determinism and schema validation.
- Update docs/roadmap/STATUS.json with the narrative infra initiative entry.

## Non-Goals
- No extraction pipeline, activation modeling, or role classification.
- No production runtime wiring beyond exports.
- No changes to deployment or workflow automation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Deterministic frame ids and infrastructure ids are generated from normalized inputs.
- Schema validation passes for representative frame and infrastructure objects.
- Unit tests cover id determinism and schema validation.
- STATUS.json is updated with the narrative infra initiative.
