## Task: Influence Defense Method Families Brief

### Objective
Create a Summit-native, defensive-only brief that codifies non-coercive influence-defense method
families, aligns them to provenance, evidence, and governance requirements, and references the
Summit Readiness Assertion.

### Requirements
- Produce a new brief at `docs/briefs/influence-defense-methods.md`.
- Keep the scope defensive, lawful, and consent-based.
- Include Summit-native implementation primitives (Evidence → Claim → Entity → Relationship → Run).
- Include claim-shaped summaries suitable for counsel review.
- Include MAESTRO security alignment (layers, threats, mitigations).
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a new initiative entry and summary counts.
- Register this prompt in `prompts/registry.yaml` with an accurate SHA-256 hash.

### Allowed Operations
- Create and edit documentation files and roadmap status.
