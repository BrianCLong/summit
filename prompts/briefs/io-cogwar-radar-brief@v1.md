# Prompt: IO/CogWar Radar 2027 Brief (v1)

## Intent
Create a concise, defensive-only one-pager that maps the IO/CogWar radar concept to Summit's
capabilities, constraints, governance defaults, and deterministic evidence outputs.

## Required Outputs
- `docs/briefs/io-cogwar-radar-2027.md`
- `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` updated with a revision note

## Constraints
- Defensive posture only; deny-by-default exports and feature-flag OFF.
- No offensive targeting or persuasion tooling.
- Include MAESTRO alignment (layers, threats, mitigations).
- Include deterministic artifact expectations.
- Reference Summit Readiness Assertion in readiness escalation section.
