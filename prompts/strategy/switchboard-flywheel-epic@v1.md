# Switchboard Flywheel Epic Prompt (v1)

## Intent
Document the Switchboard Flywheel strategy track as a governed epic plan that maps PR-1..PR-8 with CI gates, artifacts, and evidence ID format while updating the roadmap status and DecisionLedger.

## Required outputs
- `docs/roadmap/strategic/switchboard-flywheel-epic.md`
- `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`
- `packages/decision-ledger/decision_ledger.json`
- Prompt registry entry + task spec

## Constraints
- Evidence-first: enumerate evidence artifacts and required IDs.
- Align with Summit Readiness Assertion and MAESTRO layers.
- No policy bypass; deny-by-default posture.
- Include rollback posture.
