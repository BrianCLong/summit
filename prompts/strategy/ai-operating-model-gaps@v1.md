# Prompt: AI Operating Model Gaps Memo

## Goal

Produce a strategy memo that captures critical gaps in AI-native enterprise operating models and maps each gap to Summit's governed capabilities. The memo must be explicit about present-state deficiencies and the future-state Summit response.

## Scope

- docs/strategy/AI_OPERATING_MODEL_GAPS.md
- docs/roadmap/STATUS.json
- agents/examples/
- prompts/strategy/ai-operating-model-gaps@v1.md
- prompts/registry.yaml

## Requirements

- Use assertive language that states present conditions and future actions.
- Reference Summit governance alignment (Summit Readiness Assertion).
- Structure the memo with clear gap sections and Summit responses.
- Include a 23rd-order implication ladder that captures imputed intent and systemic consequences.
- Include a source index for external references.
- Update docs/roadmap/STATUS.json with a concise revision note.

## Verification

- No tests required for documentation-only changes.
- Validate that the task spec and prompt registry entry align with the memo scope.
