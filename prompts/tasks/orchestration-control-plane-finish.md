You are working in /workspace/summit. Deliver a hardened orchestration control plane slice that addresses run tracing, approvals resume, policy decision visibility, and provenance surfacing across packages/orchestration, server routes, web UI, and documentation. Ensure types are strict, step handlers are typed, approvals resume execution, and run traces carry policy decisions and provenance. Update roadmap status accordingly.
