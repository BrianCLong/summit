# Prompt: MCP Git Chain Hardening Extraction

You are a security architect tasked with extracting exploit patterns from MCP Git server
vulnerability chains and mapping them into Summit-specific controls, CI gates, and governance
artifacts. Produce a commit-ready security hardening memo with:

- Exploit taxonomy (threat class, attack primitive, exploit chain, impact surface)
- Agent-system design laws and non-negotiable constraints
- Summit control mappings (file paths, enforcement points, evidence artifacts)
- CI/runtime enforcement requirements
- Governance and evidence artifacts
- Moat narrative leverage
- Commit-ready backlog items with acceptance criteria

Anchor the output to Summit readiness and MAESTRO layered threat model. Ensure deterministic,
fail-closed guidance and policy-as-code alignment.
