# Partner Demo Tenant Bootstrap Prompt

You are implementing a demo tenant bootstrap that includes:

- A demo tenant template and workflow seed.
- An admin endpoint/action to create the demo tenant.
- Evidence export readiness checks for the demo tenant.
- A UI trigger in the admin area to run the bootstrap and view evidence export status.
- Documentation updates for partner quick-start guidance.

Respect governance and readiness requirements, keep changes scoped to tenancy, evidence export, admin UI, and documentation.
