# Humanitarian Crisis Early Warning

## Objective
Provide early warning of emerging humanitarian crises to enable timely preparedness and response, protecting vulnerable populations.

## Analysis Framework

### Crisis Indicators

1. **Displacement**
   - Internally displaced persons (IDPs)
   - Refugee flows
   - Migration patterns and trends
   - Population movement triggers
   - Host capacity and tensions

2. **Food Security**
   - Food availability and access
   - Malnutrition rates
   - Market functionality
   - Agricultural production
   - Distribution system status

3. **Health**
   - Disease outbreaks
   - Healthcare system functionality
   - Access to medical care
   - Water and sanitation
   - Mortality rates

4. **Protection**
   - Civilian casualties
   - Gender-based violence
   - Child protection concerns
   - Human rights violations
   - Access denial

5. **Basic Services**
   - Education access
   - Shelter adequacy
   - Water and sanitation
   - Energy access
   - Communication infrastructure

### Early Warning Stages

**Stage 1: Risk Identification** (3-6 months ahead)
- Deteriorating indicators
- Structural vulnerabilities
- Triggering event possibilities
- Preparedness activation

**Stage 2: Crisis Development** (1-3 months ahead)
- Rapid indicator decline
- Triggering events occurring
- Population movements beginning
- Response mobilization needed

**Stage 3: Acute Crisis** (Present)
- Severe humanitarian needs
- Large-scale displacement
- Mortality increasing
- Urgent response required

### Severity Classification
- **Level 1**: Concerning trends, enhanced monitoring
- **Level 2**: Deteriorating situation, preparedness actions
- **Level 3**: Humanitarian emergency, response activation
- **Level 4**: Catastrophic crisis, massive response required
- **Level 5**: Genocide/crimes against humanity risk

### Affected Population Estimates
- Total population affected
- Most vulnerable groups identified
- Geographic distribution
- Access constraints
- Priority needs by sector

### Response Planning

**Immediate Actions (0-30 days):**
- Lifesaving interventions
- Rapid assessment deployment
- Supply prepositioning
- Coordination mechanisms
- Funding appeals

**Short-term (1-6 months):**
- Multi-sector response scaling
- Protection programming
- Service restoration
- Camp management if needed
- Livelihood support

**Long-term (6+ months):**
- Recovery and resilience
- Durable solutions for displaced
- Development transition
- Capacity building
- Risk reduction

### Coordination Requirements
- UN agencies and clusters
- International NGOs
- Local authorities and organizations
- Donor coordination
- Military/civilian coordination if relevant

### Ethical Imperatives
- Humanitarian principles (humanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence)
- Do no harm
- Protection prioritization
- Participation and accountability
- Conflict sensitivity

### Monitoring and Updates
- Weekly situation reports during crisis
- Monthly outlook updates
- Indicator tracking dashboards
- Scenario adjustments
- Lessons learned capture

### Applications
- UN and humanitarian agency planning
- Donor funding decisions
- NGO program design
- Government preparedness
- Academic research on humanitarian action
