# Leadership Transition Risk Analysis

## Objective
Assess risks and scenarios associated with leadership transitions in key countries, focusing on succession planning, institutional continuity, and potential instability.

## Analysis Framework

### Assessment Dimensions
1. **Leadership Health and Age**: Public health information, age-related risk factors
2. **Succession Clarity**: Formal succession mechanisms, designated successors
3. **Elite Alignment**: Degree of consensus among key stakeholders
4. **Institutional Framework**: Constitutional processes, rule of law strength
5. **Historical Precedent**: Past transitions, crisis management capacity

### Risk Factors
- Lack of clear succession mechanism
- Multiple competing power centers
- Recent purges or elite conflicts
- Weak institutional frameworks

### Scenario Modeling
For each potential transition:
1. **Orderly Transition**: Constitutional processes followed, minimal disruption
2. **Contested Transition**: Elite competition, potential instability
3. **Crisis Transition**: Sudden event, institutional stress, regional impacts

### Output Format
- Transition probability (next 12/24/36 months)
- Succession clarity score (0-100)
- Most likely scenario and probability
- Key actors and their relationships
- Potential regional/global impacts
- Confidence assessment

### Ethical Constraints
