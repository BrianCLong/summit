# Scenario Modeling Framework

## Objective
Develop structured "what-if" scenarios to explore potential futures, test assumptions, and support strategic planning under uncertainty.

## Scenario Development Process

### Step 1: Define Scope and Objectives
- **Geographic Focus**: Global, regional, or country-specific
- **Time Horizon**: Short (1-2 years), medium (5-10 years), long (10+ years)
- **Key Question**: What decision or strategy is this analysis informing?
- **Stakeholders**: Who needs the analysis and what do they need to know?

### Step 2: Identify Critical Uncertainties
Scan for major uncertainties across domains:
- **Political**: Leadership changes, regime stability, political realignments
- **Economic**: Growth trajectories, financial crises, trade patterns
- **Social**: Demographics, migration, social movements, values shifts
- **Technological**: Breakthroughs, disruptions, adoption rates
- **Environmental**: Climate impacts, resource scarcity, natural disasters
- **Military/Security**: Conflicts, arms races, alliance changes

Prioritize:
- **High Impact**: Would significantly affect outcomes
- **High Uncertainty**: Multiple plausible futures
- **Independent**: Not determined by other factors

### Step 3: Develop Scenario Framework
Select 2-3 critical uncertainties as axes:
- Create 4 scenarios (2x2 matrix) or 8 scenarios (2x2x2 cube)
- Each scenario represents a distinct, plausible future
- Ensure scenarios span the possibility space
- Make scenarios mutually exclusive but collectively exhaustive

**Example Framework:**
- Axis 1: US-China Relations (Cooperative ↔ Conflictual)
- Axis 2: Technology Trajectory (Open ↔ Fragmented)

Creates 4 scenarios:
1. **Open World**: Cooperation + Open tech
2. **Techno-Blocs**: Cooperation + Fragmented tech
3. **Cold Peace**: Conflict + Open tech
4. **New Cold War**: Conflict + Fragmented tech

### Step 4: Build Scenario Narratives

For each scenario:

**Initial Conditions (Present):**
- Starting point based on current reality
- Key trends and drivers

**Pathway (How We Get There):**
- Critical events or decisions
- Tipping points
- Reinforcing dynamics
- Timeline of developments

**End State (Time Horizon):**
- Detailed description of the world
- All relevant dimensions (political, economic, social, etc.)
- Specific implications for key actors
- Indicators that this scenario is emerging

**Probability Assessment:**
- Expert judgment or quantitative methods
- Ensure probabilities sum to 100%
- Update as new information emerges

### Step 5: Analyze Implications

For each scenario, assess:

**Opportunities:**
- Favorable developments
- Strategic advantages
- Areas for proactive shaping

**Risks:**
- Adverse developments
- Vulnerabilities exposed
- Required defenses or hedges

**Indicators:**
- Early warning signs scenario is emerging
- Monitoring plan

**Strategic Options:**
- Actions that perform well across scenarios (robust strategies)
- Actions that bet on specific scenario (adaptive strategies)
- Hedges to reduce downside risk
- Shaping actions to make preferred scenarios more likely

### Step 6: Strategy Development

**Robust Strategies:**
- Perform reasonably well across all scenarios
- Reduce regret risk
- Build resilience and flexibility

**Adaptive Strategies:**
- Monitor indicators
- Decision trees and contingency plans
- Preserve option value

**Shaping Strategies:**
- Invest in making preferred scenarios more likely
- Prevent undesired scenarios

**Hedging Strategies:**
- Reduce exposure to worst outcomes
- Diversification
- Insurance mechanisms

### Scenario Types

**Exploratory Scenarios:**
- What could happen?
- Scan possibility space
- Challenge assumptions

**Normative Scenarios:**
- What should happen?
- Define preferred futures
- Guide goal-setting

**Predictive Scenarios:**
- What will happen?
- Forecast most likely future
- Point estimates with uncertainty

**Backcasting:**
- Start with desired end state
- Work backward to identify pathway
- Identify required actions

### Methodological Approaches

**Qualitative:**
- Expert workshops
- Historical analogies
- Narrative storytelling

**Quantitative:**
- Statistical forecasting
- Agent-based modeling
- System dynamics modeling

**Hybrid:**
- Combine qualitative insights and quantitative rigor
- Scenario probabilities from expert elicitation
- Model consequences within scenarios

### Best Practices

**Quality Criteria:**
- Plausible: Could realistically happen
- Distinct: Meaningfully different from each other
- Consistent: Internal logic holds
- Relevant: Addresses key questions and decisions
- Challenging: Stretches thinking beyond conventional wisdom

**Process:**
- Diverse perspectives (avoid groupthink)
- Structured methods (rigor and documentation)
- Iterative refinement
- Regular updates (scenarios aren't static)
- Clear communication

**Communication:**
- Vivid, memorable scenario names
- Engaging narratives
- Clear visual frameworks
- Decision-focused presentation
- Avoid false precision

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Scenarios that are just best/worst/status quo
- Anchoring on current trends (surprise-free scenarios)
- Hidden assumptions not examined
- Confusing scenarios with forecasts
- Failing to update scenarios as world changes
- Too many scenarios (>4 becomes unwieldy)
- Too narrow scope (missing critical factors)

### Ethical Considerations
- Consider humanitarian impacts in all scenarios
- Include vulnerable populations' perspectives
- Avoid self-fulfilling negative scenarios
- Use scenarios for preparation, not manipulation
- Transparent about assumptions and limitations

### Applications
- Strategic planning (government, business)
- Risk management
- Policy analysis
- Investment decisions
- Wargaming and exercises
- Public deliberation and foresight
