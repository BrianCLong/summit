# Strategic Resource Dependency Analysis

## Objective
Assess dependencies on strategic resources critical to economic security, technological advancement, and national security.

## Analysis Framework

### Critical Resource Categories

1. **Energy Resources**
   - Oil and natural gas
   - Coal and uranium
   - Renewable energy components
   - Battery materials
   - Hydrogen infrastructure

2. **Technology Minerals**
   - Rare earth elements (17 elements)
   - Lithium, cobalt, nickel
   - Copper, aluminum
   - Silicon and germanium
   - Graphite and manganese

3. **Industrial Materials**
   - Steel and specialty alloys
   - Chemicals and catalysts
   - Concrete and construction materials
   - Plastics and composites

4. **Food and Agriculture**
   - Staple grains
   - Fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphate, potash)
   - Seeds and agricultural technology
   - Animal feed

### Dependency Assessment Dimensions

**Supply Concentration Risk**
- Geographic concentration (Herfindahl index)
- Producer market shares
- Processing/refining concentration
- Reserve depletion rates

**Import Dependence**
- Percentage imported
- Source country diversity
- Reliability of suppliers
- Alternative source availability

**Strategic Reserve Adequacy**
- Current stockpile levels
- Days/months of consumption
- Release mechanisms
- Replenishment plans

**Substitution Potential**
- Technical substitutes available
- Cost of substitution
- Time required to switch
- Performance trade-offs

**Domestic Production Potential**
- Resource presence domestically
- Economic viability
- Environmental constraints
- Time to production

### Criticality Scoring (0-100)
Combines:
- Economic importance (40%)
- Supply risk (40%)
- Substitutability (20%)

**90-100**: Critical dependency, severe risk
**70-89**: High dependency, significant risk
**50-69**: Moderate dependency, manageable risk
**0-49**: Low dependency, minimal risk

### Geopolitical Vulnerability
- Dependence on potential adversaries
- Transit through risky territories
- Political leverage implications
- Sanctions/embargo vulnerability
- Price manipulation exposure

### Mitigation Strategies

**Short-term (0-2 years):**
- Build strategic reserves
- Diversify suppliers
- Secure long-term contracts
- Improve efficiency

**Medium-term (2-5 years):**
- Develop domestic sources
- Allied partnerships
- Substitution R&D
- Recycling and circular economy

**Long-term (5+ years):**
- Technology transitions
- New material development
- Deep-sea or space resources
- Structural demand reduction

### Scenario Analysis
- **Supply Disruption**: Sudden cutoff, impacts and responses
- **Price Shock**: Severe price increase, economic effects
- **Technology Shift**: Demand changes from innovation
- **Geopolitical Weaponization**: Deliberate supply leverage

### Monitoring Indicators
- Monthly: Prices, trade flows, inventory levels
- Quarterly: Production data, new discoveries, policy changes
- Annually: Reserve assessments, technology advances, demand forecasts

### Ethical Considerations
- Environmental sustainability
- Fair trade and labor standards
- Indigenous rights in extraction
- Conflict minerals avoidance
- Equitable global access

### Applications
- Industrial policy development
- National security strategy
- Trade policy formulation
- R&D investment prioritization
- Business supply chain management
