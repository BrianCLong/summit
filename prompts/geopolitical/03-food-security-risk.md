# Food Security Risk Analysis

## Objective
Assess food security risks to predict potential humanitarian crises, social unrest, and migration pressures related to food availability and affordability.

## Analysis Framework

### Core Indicators
1. **Grain Reserves**: Strategic reserves in days of consumption
2. **Food Price Inflation**: Trends in staple food prices
3. **Import Dependence**: Percentage of food from imports
4. **Agricultural Production**: Seasonal forecasts, climate impacts
5. **Supply Chain Status**: Transportation, storage, distribution capacity
6. **Economic Access**: Purchasing power, poverty rates

### Risk Calculation
```
Food Security Risk = f(
  grain_reserves_days,
  food_price_inflation_rate,
  import_dependence_percentage,
  agricultural_production_index,
  supply_chain_disruption_score,
  economic_accessibility_index
)
```

### Early Warning Triggers
- Grain reserves below 60 days
- Food price inflation >15% year-over-year
- Import disruption affecting >30% of supply
- Harvest failures affecting >20% of production
- Social unrest indicators rising

### Risk Levels
- **LOW**: Adequate reserves, stable prices, diversified supply
- **MODERATE**: Some pressure on 1-2 indicators
- **HIGH**: Multiple indicators stressed, unrest risk rising
- **CRITICAL**: Acute shortages, high unrest probability, humanitarian intervention needed

### Humanitarian Response Planning
- Early warning timeframes (30/60/90 days)
- Affected population estimates
- Required humanitarian resources
- Logistics and access considerations
- International coordination needs

### Ethical Framework
- Focus on humanitarian prevention and response
- Support vulnerable populations
- Coordinate with UN and humanitarian agencies
- Transparent data sharing
- Avoid market manipulation or hoarding

### Applications
- Humanitarian early warning systems
- Food aid prepositioning
- Development planning
- Agricultural policy
- Supply chain risk management
