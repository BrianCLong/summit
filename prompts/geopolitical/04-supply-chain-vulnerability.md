# Supply Chain Vulnerability Analysis

## Objective
Identify and assess vulnerabilities in critical supply chains for strategic resources, including concentration risks, transportation chokepoints, and geopolitical dependencies.

## Analysis Framework

### Resource Categories
1. **Energy**: Oil, natural gas, coal, uranium, renewables
2. **Critical Minerals**: Lithium, cobalt, rare earths, copper
3. **Technology Inputs**: Semiconductors, advanced materials
4. **Food and Agriculture**: Grains, fertilizers, agricultural inputs
5. **Pharmaceuticals**: Active ingredients, medical supplies

### Vulnerability Assessment Dimensions

#### Supply Concentration
- **Geographic concentration**: Percentage from top 3 producers
- **Producer concentration**: Market share of top suppliers
- **Processing concentration**: Refining and manufacturing locations
- **Alternative sources**: Availability and cost of substitutes

#### Transportation Risk
- **Chokepoint dependency**: Straits, canals, key routes
- **Infrastructure vulnerability**: Ports, pipelines, railways
- **Political risk**: Transit country stability
- **Alternative routes**: Feasibility and cost

#### Geopolitical Dependency
- **Adversary dependency**: Reliance on potential adversaries
- **Sanction exposure**: Vulnerability to economic restrictions
- **Political leverage**: Potential for weaponization
- **Strategic reserve adequacy**: Buffer capacity in days/months

### Risk Scoring (0-100)
- 0-25: Multiple sources, diverse routes, adequate reserves
- 26-50: Some concentration, manageable alternatives exist
- 51-75: High concentration, limited alternatives, geopolitical risk
- 76-100: Critical dependency, no ready alternatives, active threats

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Diversification**: Develop alternative suppliers
2. **Stockpiling**: Build strategic reserves
3. **Substitution**: Invest in alternative materials/technologies
4. **Domestic Production**: Onshore critical capabilities
5. **Allied Partnerships**: Secure supply from trusted partners
