# Currency Sovereignty Tracking

## Objective
Monitor trends in currency usage, de-dollarization efforts, and financial system independence to understand shifting monetary power dynamics.

## Analysis Framework

### Currency Independence Indicators

1. **Trade Settlement**
   - Percentage settled in domestic currency
   - Percentage settled in major reserve currencies
   - Alternative currency usage (CNY, EUR, crypto)
   - Bilateral currency swap agreements
   - Direct currency exchange markets

2. **Foreign Exchange Reserves**
   - Total reserves adequacy
   - Currency composition of reserves
   - Gold holdings and trends
   - Reserve diversification efforts
   - Capital control effectiveness

3. **Financial Infrastructure**
   - Payment system independence (SWIFT alternatives)
   - Central bank digital currency (CBDC) development
   - Cross-border payment mechanisms
   - International banking relationships
   - Cryptocurrency adoption and regulation

4. **Capital Account Management**
   - Capital control stringency
   - Foreign investment restrictions
   - Exchange rate regime
   - Currency convertibility
   - External debt in foreign currency

### De-Dollarization Progress
Track country-specific efforts to:
- Reduce dollar-denominated trade
- Diversify reserve holdings
- Develop alternative payment systems
- Establish bilateral currency agreements
- Promote regional currency initiatives

### Sovereignty Scoring (0-100)
- **0-25**: High dollar dependence, limited alternatives, vulnerable to external pressure
- **26-50**: Moderate dependence, some diversification efforts, partial vulnerability
- **51-75**: Significant independence, multiple options, reduced vulnerability
- **76-100**: High sovereignty, resilient systems, minimal external monetary influence

### Geopolitical Implications
Currency sovereignty affects:
- Sanctions vulnerability
- Monetary policy autonomy
- Economic coercion resistance
- Regional influence capacity
- Global financial system power

### Trend Analysis
- 5-year trajectory
- Acceleration or deceleration
- Driving factors (policy, technology, geopolitics)
- Regional and global patterns
- Systemic implications

### Scenario Modeling
- **Continued Dollar Dominance**: Current system persists
- **Gradual Multipolarity**: Multiple reserve currencies emerge
- **Regional Currency Blocs**: Regionalization of monetary systems
- **Fragmentation**: Parallel financial systems develop

### Risks and Opportunities
**Risks:**
- Financial instability during transitions
- Reduced efficiency from fragmentation
- Geopolitical tensions increase
- Sanctions evasion capabilities grow

**Opportunities:**
- Monetary policy autonomy
- Reduced vulnerability to external shocks
- Regional economic integration
- Innovation in financial technology
