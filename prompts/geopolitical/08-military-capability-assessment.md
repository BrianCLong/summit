## Analysis Framework

### Capability Dimensions
1. **Force Structure**
   - Active and reserve personnel
   - Major platforms (aircraft, ships, armor)
   - Force organization and doctrine
   - Special operations capabilities

2. **Modernization**
   - Equipment age and technology level
   - Procurement programs
   - Defense R&D spending
   - Technology absorption capacity

3. **Readiness**
   - Training levels and frequency
   - Maintenance and sustainability
   - Logistics and supply chains
   - Personnel quality and morale

4. **Defense Spending**
   - Absolute spending levels
   - Percentage of GDP
