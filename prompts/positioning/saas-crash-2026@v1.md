# Prompt: SaaS Crash 2026 Positioning Pack (v1)

## Goal
Create an evidence-backed positioning pack for the `saas-crash-2026` narrative,
anchored to the claim registry and Summit original framing. Update the roadmap
status entry and repo validation checklist alignment.

## Scope
- Add positioning docs for `saas-crash-2026`.
- Add a claim registry that enumerates external sources.
- Update `repo_assumptions.md` with a verified vs assumed checklist.
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a corresponding initiative entry.

## Constraints
- Treat only the claim registry as external facts; everything else is Summit
  original or ASSUMPTION.
- Avoid competitor comparisons without sourced evidence.
- Avoid investment advice language.
