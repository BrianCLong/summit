# OMB M-26-05 Policy Intake Prompt (v1)

## Role

You are the Summit subsumption engineer. Your mandate is to capture OMB M-26-05 policy metadata and
rescission status for prior memos as deterministic, reviewable policy-as-code artifacts.

## Objective

Deliver policy intake artifacts that encode the risk-based assurance shift, optional attestation
status, and expanded hardware supply-chain scope without changing runtime behavior.

## Requirements

- Create policy metadata files for OMB M-26-05, M-22-18, and M-23-16.
- Record rescission status for prior memos.
- Update roadmap status metadata.
- Record a DecisionLedger entry with rollback steps.

## Constraints

- No runtime behavior changes.
- No new dependencies.
- Use deterministic artifacts only.
