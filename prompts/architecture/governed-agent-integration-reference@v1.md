# Prompt: Governed Agent Integration Reference Architecture

## Objective

Publish a governed agent integration reference architecture that captures canonical APIs, event topics, connector contracts, policy gating, audit receipts, and delivery slices. Update the roadmap status to record the published artifact.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Create `docs/architecture/governed-agent-integration-reference.md` with the full architecture handoff (APIs, events, connectors, policy gate, audit receipts, flow, swap matrix, delivery slices, MAESTRO security alignment, and readiness assertion reference).
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a new completed initiative recording the document.

### Out of Scope

- Runtime implementation or code generation.
- Changes to policy engines, services, or runtime deployments.

## Constraints

- Use Summit governance language and align to readiness assertion authority.
- Preserve evidence-first posture and policy gate semantics.
- Maintain conventional commit discipline and update roadmap metadata.

## Required Outputs

- Architecture doc in `docs/architecture/governed-agent-integration-reference.md`.
- Roadmap update in `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`.
