# Annual Audit Rehearsal + External Diligence Simulation (Board-Grade)

## Objective

Conduct a full audit-readiness rehearsal using only repo-local artifacts and commands. Document
scope, walkthrough, rehearsal results, gaps, and an executive brief without remediation.

## Constraints

- No network access.
- No remediation or new controls during the rehearsal.
- Evidence captured as artifact paths + commands only (no screenshots).
- No changes to GA artifacts while rehearsing.

## Deliverables

- docs/audit/AUDIT_SCOPE_AND_QUESTIONS.md
- docs/audit/AUDIT_WALKTHROUGH.md
- docs/audit/AUDIT_REHEARSAL_RESULTS.md
- docs/audit/AUDIT_GAPS_REGISTER.md
- docs/audit/EXEC_AUDIT_READINESS_BRIEF.md

## Requirements

- 20–25 questions grouped by audit topic, each mapped to an existing artifact.
- Walkthrough must list artifacts, commands, expected indicators, and time per item; total ≤ 90 min.
- Rehearsal results must log verified/ambiguous/failed items with notes and time overruns.
- Gap register must include impact, owner role, and diligence-blocker status.
- Executive summary must be one page with evidence-bounded confidence.
