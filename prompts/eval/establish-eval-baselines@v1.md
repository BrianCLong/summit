# Establish Eval Baselines & Ratcheting (v1)

Establish baseline thresholds for CI-gated evals so current runs pass, then
document and implement a ratchet strategy that tightens thresholds per release.
Update evaluation harness logic, baseline config, and evidence artifacts to
support baseline comparisons and gating.
