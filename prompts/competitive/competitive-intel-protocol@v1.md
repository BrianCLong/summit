# Prompt: Competitive Intelligence Protocol Documentation (Summit)

## Purpose

Document and maintain the Summit-native competitive intelligence subsumption protocol used for
intake, extraction, integration planning, PR stack slicing, transcendence planning, and gate
enforcement.

## Requirements

- Publish the protocol in `docs/ci/COMPETITIVE_INTELLIGENCE_PROTOCOL.md`.
- Maintain a targets directory scaffold under `docs/ci/targets/` with deterministic layout.
- Update `docs/ci/README.md` with a reference to the protocol.
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a revision note for visibility.

## Constraints

- Do not add timestamps to deterministic artifacts.
- Keep outputs ordered and machine-auditable.
- Follow Summit documentation style and governance guidance.
