# Prompt: Summit + Maestro parity plan vs 1Code (competitive response)

## Objective
Create a governed, Summit-native parity plan that distills 1Code's public roadmap signals into
immediate MVP features, compliance rules, and moat differentiation.

## Requirements
- Produce a competitive memo in `docs/competitive/` with clear MVP directives.
- Escalate by referencing `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md` first.
- Dictate future actions (no backward-looking defenses).
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a revision note and timestamp.

## Scope
- Docs-only changes (`docs/competitive/`, `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`).
- Governance alignment with existing authority files.

## Non-Goals
- No product code changes.
- No infrastructure or policy engine modifications.
