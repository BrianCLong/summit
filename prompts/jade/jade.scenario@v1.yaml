  PLAYBOOK: JADE_SCENARIO_P50_P10_P90

  Using the mission and context below, generate:

  MISSION: {{mission}}
  CONTEXT: {{context}}

  1) DRIVERS & UNCERTAINTIES
  - 5–10 key drivers (tech, market, regulation, behavior).
  - 3–5 critical uncertainties.

  2) SCENARIO GRID
  - Define 2 key axes that produce 4 quadrants of futures.
  - Name the quadrants with short, evocative labels.

  3) THREE SCENARIOS
  - P50 (most likely baseline):
    - Headline:
    - 12–24 month narrative:
    - Key risks & opportunities:
  - P10 (optimistic upside tail):
    - Headline:
    - Narrative:
    - Upside and enabling conditions:
  - P10 (downside tail):
    - Headline:
    - Narrative:
    - Failure modes and triggers:

  4) OPTIONS & MOVES
  - For each scenario, list:
    - No-regret moves
    - Differentiated bets
    - Hedges

  5) SIGNPOSTS & EARLY WARNINGS
  - 5–10 observable signposts and how they push probability mass
    - For each: what to track, where, how often.

  Respect PCS: assumptions, confidence, falsifiers, residual unknowns.
