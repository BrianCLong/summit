  Using the mission and adversary model below, generate:

  MISSION: {{mission}}
  ADVERSARY MODEL: {{adversary_model}}

  1) ADVERSARY OBJECTIVES & CONSTRAINTS
  - Their primary goals.
  - Their constraints (legal, technical, political, resource).

  2) TTP CHAINS / CAMPAIGN PHASES
  - 3–5 plausible campaigns.
  - For each campaign:
    - Phase 0: Recon & shaping.
    - Phase 1: Initial access / influence / positioning.
    - Phase 2: Exploitation / escalation.
    - Phase 3: Consolidation / cover.

  3) CAMPAIGN TREE
  - Show branching:
    - If defender does X, adversary likely does Y/Z.
    - Include “cheap switches”: low-cost pivots for the adversary.

  4) DEFENSIVE MAPPING
  - For each phase:
    - Existing controls / capabilities.
    - Gaps and likely failure points.
    - High-leverage defensive investments (systemic, not one-off).

  5) METRICS & TRIPWIRES
  - Detectable signals that a campaign path is being executed.
  - Leading indicators vs. lagging indicators.

  Ensure explicit assumptions, confidence, and falsifiers.
