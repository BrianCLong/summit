# Summit — War-Room Backlog Execution Alignment

**Objective:** Provide a complete, execution-ready documentation package for the 90-day war-room backlog (items #60–95), including owners, cadence, acceptance evidence, and governance controls aligned to the 12-month strategic roadmap.

## Core Requirements

- Enumerate every backlog item (#60–95) with target week, DRI, and acceptance evidence.
- Define operating cadence, escalation paths, and evidence-first status updates.
- Specify workstream ownership (RACI) for cost, change, simplification, performance, data, security, trust, governance, and consolidation.
- Include a definition of done checklist that requires implementation, verification, and operational artifacts.

## Deliverables

1. Execution matrix with item-by-item ownership and evidence expectations.
2. Governance controls and escalation mechanics for GA blockers.
3. Clear next actions to seed the execution board and publish the first readiness snapshot.

## Guardrails

- Documentation must reference the canonical backlog in `90_DAY_WAR_ROOM_BACKLOG.md`.
- No placeholders; every item requires explicit ownership and acceptance evidence.
- Keep scope limited to documentation updates in the roadmap/strategic area.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All 36 items are enumerated with owners and evidence.
- The doc is production-ready for weekly execution cadence.
- Updates include a timestamp in `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` linking to the expanded documentation.
