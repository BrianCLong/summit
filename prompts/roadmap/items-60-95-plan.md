# Prompt: Items 60-95 Roadmap Plan Update

Update the roadmap tracking for items 60–95 by:

- Ensuring phased staging across Cost, Change, Security, and Trust.
- Mapping each item to owners, milestones, and acceptance tests.
- Defining weekly checkpoints, risk burndown reporting, and drift controls.
- Integrating CI/CD gates for budgets, quotas, WAF/rate limits, canary, and rollback.
- Keeping the plan aligned with policy-as-code governance and evidence artifacts.

Deliverables:

- Update `docs/roadmap/items-60-95-plan.json` and `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`.
- Provide a weekly status report template under `docs/roadmap/status-reports/`.
