# Prompt: Defense Claims Continuation Pack (v1)

## Objective
Append the next dependent claim blocks for the defense CRM medium (C451–C480) and defense simulation apparatus (S451–S480), aligned to policy arbitration, localization QA, and blast radius budgeting clusters. Update the roadmap status ledger for this IP claims continuation pack.

## Required Outputs
- `docs/ip/defense_crm_claims_v1.md` with C451–C480.
- `docs/ip/defense_simulation_apparatus_claims_v1.md` with S451–S480.
- `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` updated for the initiative.

## Constraints
- Preserve claim numbering and cluster grouping as provided.
- Arbitration is deterministic and deny-first on conflicts.
- Localization QA is gating with deny or template-only fallback.
- Blast radius budgets fail closed with monitoring-only fallback.
- Record proof artifacts and hash bindings in claim language.

## Scope
- Stay within documentation-only changes.
- Keep outputs consistent with governance terminology.
