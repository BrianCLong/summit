# Prompt: Phase 4 Innovation Suite Documentation Refresh

You are updating the Summit Phase 4 innovation suite documentation to be implementation-forcing,
policy-aware, and compliant with governance requirements. Provide complete PRDs, agent launch
specifications, and delivery readiness guidance. Ensure all changes remain within the
allowed documentation, prompt registry, and task spec scope.

Constraints:

- Edit only within `docs/innovation/`, `docs/roadmap/`, `prompts/`, and `agents/examples/`.
- Maintain the final output section ordering required by the Phase 4 brief.
- Avoid placeholders and TODOs; provide concrete requirements.
