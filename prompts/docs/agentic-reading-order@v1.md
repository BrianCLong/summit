# Prompt: Summit Agentic AI Reading Order

Create a Summit-facing reading order document for four agentic AI papers plus an optional fifth paper, including rationale and “what to steal” mappings aligned to Summit governance, provenance, and evaluation practices. Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a revision note and timestamp reflecting the documentation update. Ensure the output is concise, actionable, and aligned with the Summit Readiness Assertion posture (policy-gated autonomy, provenance-first operations, governed exceptions).
