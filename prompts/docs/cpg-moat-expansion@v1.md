# CPG Moat Expansion Prompt (v1)

## Objective

Use the provided research inputs on agent memory, orchestration, and MCP extensions to expand Summit's Context Provenance Graph (CPG) innovation summary with moated, forward-leaning capabilities. Ensure the update maps to OSINT/graph orchestration, Maestro MCP workflows, and multi-agent memory needs.

## Required Updates

- Expand `CPG_INNOVATION_SUMMARY.md` with a new section that:
  - Converts the four research themes into Summit-native, moat-grade innovations.
  - Defines how memory, orchestration, and MCP context handling become governed, auditable, and drift-proof.
  - Introduces a Goal/State Fabric concept aligned to CPG.
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a new `last_updated` timestamp and a revision note describing the documentation update.

## Constraints

- Do not add speculative claims of performance unless grounded in existing Summit artifacts.
- Use assertive language; avoid uncertainty.
- Maintain existing document tone and formatting.

## Deliverable

A single commit that updates the CPG innovation summary and roadmap status to reflect the moat expansion.
