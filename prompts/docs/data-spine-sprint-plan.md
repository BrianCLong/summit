# Prompt: Document Data Spine Sprint Plan

## Intent

Codify the CompanyOS Sprint 28 "Data Spine: Lineage, Residency, Retention" plan with evidence scaffolding and roadmap references.

## Scope

- Create or update documentation that captures sprint goals, epics, acceptance criteria, risks, and metrics.
- Seed evidence directories for catalog, residency, retention, and lineage artifacts.
- Refresh roadmap metadata to reflect the plan addition without altering status summaries.

## Constraints

- Follow repository AGENTS guidance (root). Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` alongside documentation changes.
- Keep artifacts deterministic and free of TODO placeholders or secrets.
- Use conventional commits and populate PR metadata per `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Verification

- Documentation lint/readability review.
- Diff inspection to ensure paths stay within declared scope.
