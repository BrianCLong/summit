# Prompt: Federated Campaign Radar v1 Spec

You are updating the Federated Campaign Radar (FCR) specification to produce a
v1-ready document. The update must:

- Include authority alignment references to Summit governance artifacts.
- Define the shared schema, protocol steps, and privacy invariants.
- Expand threat model and KPI sections to include provenance lift and privacy
  accounting requirements.
- Keep the spec in `docs/federated-campaign-radar-spec.md` and update
  `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with the new spec status.

Constraints:

- Documentation-only change set (no code changes).
- Maintain repository voice and formatting.
- Ensure all governance references are file-backed links within the repo.
