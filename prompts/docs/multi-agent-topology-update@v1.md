# Prompt: Multi-Agent Topology Update (v1)

## Objective
Update Summit documentation to capture the default multi-agent topology guidance for orchestration systems, while keeping governance artifacts synchronized.

## Required Changes
- Update or add documentation under `docs/orchestration/` that clarifies the coordinator-first multi-agent topology and its operational implications.
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a new `last_updated` timestamp and a concise `revision_note`.

## Constraints
- Preserve existing terminology and governance references.
- Use clear, directive language; avoid uncertainty.
- Do not introduce unsupported claims without citations already present in the document.

## Deliverables
- Documentation update with the topology directive.
- Updated roadmap status metadata.
