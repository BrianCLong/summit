# Prompt: Narrative Dominance Operationalization Extensions (v1)

## Objective
Expand Summit narrative dominance standards with operational signals focused on determinism, provenance, and longitudinal analysis. Add new high-signal extensions that formalize narrative debt, audience partitioning, exhaustion attacks, assumption modeling, compression metrics, counter-narrative absorption, funnel convergence, governance signaling, state transitions, and half-life metrics.

## Requirements
- Update documentation in `docs/standards/narrative-dominance-tech.md`.
- Preserve defense-only posture and deterministic evidence requirements.
- Reference Summit readiness governance where applicable.
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a clear revision note and initiative note.

## Constraints
- Documentation-only changes.
- No implementation or runtime behavior changes.
- Use concise, audit-ready language with explicit detection signals and operationalization steps.
