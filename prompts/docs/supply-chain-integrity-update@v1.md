# Prompt: Supply Chain Integrity Update (Docs)

Create a concise supply chain integrity update in `docs/supply-chain/INTEGRITY_UPDATE_2026-01-14.md`.
The update must:

- Summarize current standards and best practices (SBOM, SLSA, SSDF).
- Call out threat landscape signals.
- Provide PR-ready execution directives scoped to CI/CD, policy-as-code enforcement, dependency drift monitoring, and documentation/runbooks.
- Reference the Summit Readiness Assertion and internal authority docs for alignment.
- Record decision log items including Governed Exceptions, compliance logging, and any deferred items.
- Include evidence artifact expectations and a forward-leaning enhancement.

Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a new `last_updated` timestamp and a revision note reflecting the documentation update.

Do not modify code outside the declared docs and roadmap files.
