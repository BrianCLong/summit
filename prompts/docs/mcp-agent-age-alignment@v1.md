# Prompt: MCP Agent-Age Architecture Alignment (v1)

## Objective

Document how Summit/IntelGraph should align MCP server architecture with modern agent-era best practices, and record the roadmap status update.

## Scope

- intelgraph-mcp/docs/strategy/
- docs/roadmap/STATUS.json
- prompts/registry.yaml
- agents/examples/

## Requirements

- Add a new strategy note mapping best practices to Summit MCP components and governance.
- Update the MCP blueprint to link the new note.
- Update docs/roadmap/STATUS.json with a revision note and timestamp.
- Keep changes documentation-only (no production code paths).

## Non-Goals

- Implement new MCP services or change runtime behavior.
- Modify CI/CD workflows.
