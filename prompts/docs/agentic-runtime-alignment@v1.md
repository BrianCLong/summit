# Prompt: Agentic Runtime Alignment Documentation (v1)

## Intent

Document the Agentic Mesh architecture alignment with the agentic runtime (AOS)
layer, including governance hooks and explicit Summit readiness authority
references.

## Required Assertions

- Reference `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md` and the governance authority
  files in `docs/governance/` as the canonical sources of definitions.
- State the future-facing action for Summit’s agentic runtime abstraction with
  execution, policy/eval hooks, and pluggable model/tool backends.
- Record any deviations as **Governed Exceptions**.

## Scope

- `docs/agentic-mesh/**`
- `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`
- `prompts/docs/agentic-runtime-alignment@v1.md`
- `prompts/registry.yaml`

## Guardrails

- Keep changes within declared scope.
- Use concise, present-tense assertions and forward directives.
- End sections with clear outcomes or alignment statements.
