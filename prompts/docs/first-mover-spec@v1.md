# Prompt: Summit first-mover spec + demo (4-6 weeks)

Create a documentation-only change that converts the user request into a minimal, opinionated
spec and demo plan for Summit's first-mover advantage. The spec must:

- Select 2-3 fundamentals to pursue first.
- Define a minimal, governed spec for each fundamental.
- Provide a 4-6 week demo plan with milestones and evidence artifacts.
- Reference the Summit Readiness Assertion and governance documents.
- Declare deferred items as "Governed Exceptions" or "Deferred pending X" (no uncertainty).
- Update docs/roadmap/STATUS.json with a clear revision note and timestamp.

Scope:

- Add a new document under docs/strategy/.
- Update prompts/registry.yaml with this prompt hash.
- Add a task spec under agents/examples/ conforming to agents/task-spec.schema.json.

Constraints:

- Documentation-only change.
- Conventional commit required.
- Provide PR metadata block in PR body.
