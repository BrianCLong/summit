# Prompt: Grounded Claim Contract Documentation (v1)

## Mission

Document the MMFormalizer-inspired grounded reasoning contract for Summit, including the
GroundedClaim schema, termination rules, validation gates, and benchmark expectations. Keep the
specification evidence-bound and governance-aligned.

## Scope

- Add or update documentation in `docs/` describing the grounded claim contract.
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a revision note reflecting the documentation change.

## Constraints

- Align with the Summit Readiness Assertion and governance rules.
- Do not introduce policy logic outside the policy engine; document policy-as-code requirements.
- Keep the work in documentation scope; implementation is deferred.

## Deliverables

- A new or updated grounded claim contract document in `docs/`.
- A roadmap status update reflecting the documentation change.
