# Prompt: Agentic Verification Standard (80% Problem) - PR1

## Intent
Add governance documentation for the agentic verification standard (the 80% problem), including
security data handling and operational runbook guidance. Update repo assumptions and roadmap status
as required by governance.

## Required Outputs
- `docs/standards/the-80-problem-in-agentic-coding.md`
- `docs/security/data-handling/the-80-problem-in-agentic-coding.md`
- `docs/ops/runbooks/the-80-problem-in-agentic-coding.md`
- `repo_assumptions.md` updated with agentic verification assumptions
- `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` updated with an in-progress initiative

## Constraints
- Deterministic, policy-aligned wording; no speculative claims.
- No runtime code changes or workflow rewrites.
- Include MAESTRO alignment sections in new docs.
- No prompt/model output logging requirements.

## Evidence
- Include citations to governance sources and explicit acceptance tests in the standard.
