# Prompt: Intelligence Foundry Architecture Docs (v1)

## Objective

Create a commit-ready architecture documentation bundle for the Summit Intelligence Foundry, including specs, data model, API contracts, evidence/attestations, threat model, operating model, roadmap, executive comparison, investor narrative, and ADR.

## Scope

- docs/architecture/comparisons/
- docs/architecture/narratives/
- docs/adr/ADR-021-intelligence-foundry.md

## Requirements

- Use deterministic, testable language and RFC 2119 terms where normative.
- Align governance posture with evidence-grade provenance and policy constraints.
- Update docs/roadmap/STATUS.json with a clear revision note.
- Ensure files are ready for direct commit without post-processing.
