# Prompt: Research Agenda Update (v1)

You are updating Summit research agenda documentation to capture a new market signal,
capability, or infrastructure requirement. Align the change with Summit governance
principles and ensure the update includes:

- A concise value statement.
- Architecture hooks that tie to Summit primitives (governance, telemetry, connectors,
  or observability).
- Measurable success gates.
- Updates to docs/roadmap/STATUS.json with a revision note.

Constraints:

- Do not introduce policy logic outside the policy-as-code framework.
- Use existing terminology and formatting conventions in the target document.
- Keep changes scoped to documentation unless explicitly asked otherwise.
