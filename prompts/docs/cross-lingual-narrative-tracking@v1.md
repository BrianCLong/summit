# Prompt: Cross-lingual and cross-platform narrative tracking

You are implementing a documentation update for Summit/IntelGraph that specifies how to track
narratives across languages and platforms. Capture:

- A semantic/translation layer using multilingual embeddings to cluster equivalent narratives and
  map their evolution over time.
- Platform-shift graphs that model narrative transitions between platforms and correlate
  transitions with reach or sentiment shifts.
- Data model, pipeline stages, governance, and verification expectations.

Scope is limited to documentation and governance artifacts needed for this change.
