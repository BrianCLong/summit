# Prompt: Agent Communication Protocol Spec (v1)

## Objective

Create a new documentation spec that defines a novel, transformational agent communication protocol for Summit, focusing on skill/persona transfer, collaborative learning, and governance alignment.

## Required Outputs

- A new doc at `docs/communications/nexus-relay-protocol.md` describing the protocol, its primitives, governance alignment, and rollout plan.
- Update `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json` with a new timestamp and revision note referencing the new spec.
- Provide a task contract in `agents/examples/` that references this prompt.

## Constraints

- Align with Summit governance authority files: `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md`, `docs/governance/CONSTITUTION.md`, `docs/governance/META_GOVERNANCE.md`, and `docs/governance/AGENT_MANDATES.md`.
- Treat legacy bypasses as governed exceptions.
- Use decisive language and avoid uncertainty.

## Verification

- No tests required (documentation-only change).
