# Prompt: 23rd-Order Imputed Intention Delivery (MCP Ecosystem Update)

## Objective

Deliver a governance-first 23rd-order imputed intention artifact for the MCP ecosystem update, aligned to Summit readiness and governance authorities. The output must be evidence-first, deterministic, and scoped to documentation plus roadmap status tracking.

## Required Outputs

1. `docs/analysis/imputed-intent-23rd-order.md`
   - UEF evidence bundle first.
   - Explicit MAESTRO security alignment.
   - 23-order imputed intention chain.
   - Governance references and finality statement.

2. `docs/roadmap/STATUS.json`
   - Add or update a tracking entry for the delivery.
   - Update `last_updated`, `revision_note`, and summary totals as required.

## Constraints

- Documentation-only change (no product code changes).
- Deny-by-default posture and evidence-first formatting.
- Ensure alignment with:
  - `docs/SUMMIT_READINESS_ASSERTION.md`
  - `docs/governance/CONSTITUTION.md`
  - `docs/governance/META_GOVERNANCE.md`
  - `docs/ga/TESTING-STRATEGY.md`
  - `docs/architecture/mcp-first.md`

## Out of Scope

- Runtime code changes, migrations, or policy engine modifications.
- Any change requiring human countersignature.
