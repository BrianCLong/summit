# Prompt: FMCP-TPCE completion pass

## Objective

Deliver a clean, merge-ready update for the FMCP-TPCE provisional and related patent docket docs. Address review feedback by expanding the provisional into a complete, filing-ready narrative with clear system architecture, capsule schema, trust translation mechanics, policy negotiation steps, failure handling, observability, and security posture. Ensure related patent intake and innovation tracker entries are consistent and precise.

## Scope

- docs/patents/provisionals/fmcp-tpce.md
- docs/patents/innovation-intake-and-provisionals.md
- docs/patents/patentable-innovations.md
- docs/roadmap/STATUS.json (refresh timestamp + revision note)

## Guardrails

- Keep changes documentation-focused; avoid code changes.
- Reflect governance requirements (policy-as-code, provenance, auditability) in narrative sections.
- Maintain conventional structure and concise, actionable detail.

## Expected Outcome

A filing-ready provisional draft and consistent docket entries that are accurate, detailed, and aligned with Summit governance constraints, ready to merge cleanly.
