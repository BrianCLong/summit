# IntelGraph Maestro Conductor (MC)

## Generations‑Beyond Best‑in‑Breed Build Platform — Integrated Plan

> Mission: Convert intent into shippable, compliant, observable product increments by unifying the most valuable capabilities from AI IDEs, low/no‑code builders, SDLC analytics, AIOps/MLOps, agent frameworks, and governance stacks into one orchestrated, evidence‑backed platform.

---

## 0) Conductor Summary (For Stakeholder Buy‑In)

**Goal**: Fold every useful capability across surveyed tools into MC, delivering a single orchestrated SDLC and data/AI build surface that is provably compliant, cost‑aware, and SLO‑driven.

**Non‑Goals**: Become a monolith; replace best‑of‑breed engines; lock‑in runtimes; compromise tenant isolation or provenance.

**Constraints**: Org Defaults (SLOs, cost guardrails, privacy, multi‑region), regulated topologies (SaaS MT, ST‑DED, Black‑Cell), evidence‑first operations, and deterministic rollout gates.

**Risks**: Scope creep; model/runtimes drift; agentic autonomy without guardrails; cost overruns; multi‑region data gravity.

**Definition of Done**: End‑to‑end slice from idea→prod with:

- Intent capture → backlog → design/ADR → code/tests → infra → release → observability, all traced in a provenance ledger.
- ABAC/OPA enforced, SLOs green, cost within guardrails, exportable evidence bundle.

## 1) Capability Ambition Map (Synthesized from the Landscape)

We integrate the most useful capabilities across AI IDEs (Copilot/Cursor/JetBrains), visual app builders (Bubble/Webflow/Quickbase/AppSheet), workflow/ETL (Airtable Omni/Parabola/Budibase), SDLC analytics/VSM (LinearB/Sleuth/Haystack/Plandek), LLMops/RAG (LangChain/LlamaIndex/DSPy/Haystack), inference (vLLM/SGLang/TGI/Ollama), eval/guardrails (LangSmith/Giskard/Ragas/Guardrails.ai/Evidently), agents & orchestration (Dify/Chainlit/AutoRAG, multi‑agent), and GPU/runtime mgmt (GPUStack). MC fuses these into coherent domains:

### 1.1 Intent→Backlog (Product OS)

- Natural‑language intent capture; auto‑epic/story/task decomposition using policy‑aware templates.
- MoSCoW prioritization, dependencies, RACI; acceptance criteria and verification steps generated and linked.
- Traceability matrix auto‑maintained (requirements ↔ tests ↔ code ↔ deploy ↔ SLOs).

### 1.2 Design & Architecture

- Mermaid/PlantUML diagrams; ADR library with compare/contrast and rollback notes.
- Threat model (STRIDE), abuse/misuse catalog, privacy design (minimization, purpose, retention tiers).
- Cost/design simulators (stateful LLM‑assisted what‑if with price/perf envelopes).

### 1.3 Implementation (DevEx)

- AI pair dev (multi‑model), refactors, test generation, PR review with policy checks.
- Repo hygiene: scaffolds (Node/Apollo, React/MUI/Cytoscape, Python AI, Ops/IaC), secrets scanning, SBOM.
- Multi‑agent “workcell” that coordinates codegen, testgen, docs, and migrations under guardrails.

### 1.4 Data & Graph

- Canonical entity/edge models, labeling, retention/residency; Cypher/SQL templates with cost hints.
- RAG‑ready data contracts; provenance ledger linking source→transform→use.

### 1.5 Ingest & Pipelines

- Day‑0 connectors (S3/CSV, HTTP pull/push, File Drop). Phase‑Next: GCS/Azure, JDBC, webhooks, bus adapters.
- Streaming/batch with backpressure, dedupe, schema mapping, field‑level encryption, hash manifests.

### 1.6 AI/LLM Platform

- Multi‑model (open/closed), routing, caching; cost/latency policies; eval‑before‑prod.
- Tool‑use & function‑calling, code‑exec sandboxes, retrieval APIs, multi‑agent orchestration with authority binding.
- Red‑team, toxicity/PII filters, jailbreak heuristics, reproducible prompts, versioned memories.

### 1.7 Testing & Evals

- Unit/integration/e2e/load/chaos; golden datasets.
- LLM evals: factuality, grounding, prompt regression; RAG diagnostics; guardrail tests.

### 1.8 CI/CD & Releases

- Trunk‑based, gates: lint/type/tests/SBOM/policy simulation; staged canary; auto‑rollback.
- Evidence bundle: SLO and eval reports, hashes, change manifests.

### 1.9 Observability & SRE

- OpenTelemetry by default; metrics/logs/traces + model/agent telemetry.
- Error budgets, burn alerts; cost dashboards; provenance integrity monitors.

### 1.10 Governance, Privacy, Compliance

- OIDC/JWT; ABAC via OPA; SCIM; WebAuthn; field‑level encryption.
- Policy reasoner with license/TOS classes, retention tiers, purpose tags.
- Audit exports (signed), region sharding, black‑cell packages.

### 1.11 Extensibility & Marketplace

- Stable plugin contracts (connectors, agents, UIs, policies, evaluators, dashboards, blueprints).
- Tenant‑scoped app store with signing, SBOM, runtime quotas, and contract tests.
