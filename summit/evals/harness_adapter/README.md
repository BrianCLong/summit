# Summit Harness Adapter

This module adapts external skill harnesses (like the one in `microsoft/agent-skills`) to the Summit evaluation framework.

## Usage

```bash
python -m summit.evals.harness_adapter.run
```

This will run in mock mode by default, generating evidence in `evidence/agent-skills/`.
