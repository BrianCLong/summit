# Agent Behavior Test Plan

## Scope

- Jules: must always produce PR metadata + tests + docs.
- Codex: must never reintroduce known-bad changes.
- Reviewer: must give explicit verdict.
- Predictive: must output prioritized recommendations.
- Psyops: must identify at least one threat vector or confirm low risk.

Each agent has explicit test cases mirroring these rules.
