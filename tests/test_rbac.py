# This is a pseudo-test. A full RBAC test would require:
# 1. A running FastAPI application with actual JWT generation/validation.
# 2. Mocks for the authentication dependencies.
# 3. A way to generate JWT tokens with different roles for testing.

# For demonstration, we'll assume a client that can send requests with headers.

# @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
# def client():
#     return TestClient(app)

#     # Simulate a non-admin user trying to access raw records
#     # This would require a JWT token for a non-admin role
#     headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer non_admin_jwt_token"}
#     response = client.get("/eval/records", headers=headers)
#     assert response.status_code == 403 # Forbidden

# def test_summaries_with_viewer_role(client):
#     # Simulate a viewer user trying to access summary
#     # This would require a JWT token for a viewer role
#     headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer viewer_jwt_token"}
#     response = client.get("/eval/summary?workflow=r1_rapid_attribution&since_ms=0", headers=headers)
