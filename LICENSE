Copyright (c) 2024–2025
Topicality LLC, Topicality Summit, and Brian C. Long
All rights reserved.

This Agreement governs access to and use of the Topicality Summit software
and all accompanying documentation, models, data, configurations, keys,
interfaces, and other deliverables (the "Software") provided by Topicality
LLC, Topicality Summit, and Brian C. Long (collectively, the "Licensor"). Any
rights not expressly granted are reserved.

1. Commercial Agreement Required
   Access to and use of the Software is conditioned on your prior acceptance
   of and continued compliance with a written commercial agreement, order
   form, or proof-of-concept agreement executed with the Licensor (a
   "Commercial Agreement"). In the event of any conflict between this notice
   and a valid Commercial Agreement, the Commercial Agreement controls.

2. License Grant (Enterprise Use Only)
   Subject to the Commercial Agreement and this notice, the Licensor grants
   you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
   non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software solely for your
   internal business purposes and only in the environments and quantities
   specified in the Commercial Agreement. No other rights are granted by
   implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

3. Restrictions (Non-Exhaustive)
   Except as expressly authorized in a Commercial Agreement, you may not and
   may not permit any third party to:
   - provide the Software (or any output) as a hosted, SaaS, platform,
     bureau, managed service, or timesharing service to any third party;
   - use the Software to build, train, fine-tune, or improve any product,
     service, model, or dataset that competes with or substitutes for the
     Software or any offering of the Licensor;
   - copy, modify, fork, translate, adapt, decompile, disassemble, reverse
     engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to any source
     code, models, weights, prompts, data, or trade secrets in the Software
     (except to the limited extent required by applicable law and only after
     providing prior written notice to the Licensor);
   - remove, obscure, or modify any proprietary notices, security mechanisms,
     or technical controls;
   - publish or disclose performance, benchmarking, or security test results
     without the Licensor's prior written consent;
   - circumvent usage limits, licensing controls, or access restrictions;
   - redistribute, resell, rent, lease, loan, sublicense, assign, pledge, or
     otherwise transfer the Software (or any keys, tokens, credentials, or
     access) to any third party;
   - use the Software to develop training data for any competitive AI/ML
     models or to mine, scrape, or extract proprietary parameters, prompts,
     or weights;
   - use the Software in violation of applicable law, including export
     control, sanctions, privacy, or information security requirements; or
   - deploy the Software in safety-critical or high-risk environments without
     a separate written agreement that expressly permits such use.

4. Ownership; Derivative Works
   The Software is licensed, not sold. The Licensor retains all right, title,
   and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property
   rights and any modifications, updates, or derivative works, regardless of
   who creates or provides them. To the extent you create any modifications,
   derivative works, or improvements to the Software, you hereby assign to
   the Licensor all right, title, and interest in such works. Where
   assignment is not permitted by law, you grant the Licensor an exclusive,
   perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license (with rights to
   sublicense) to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, perform, display, make
   available, and otherwise exploit those works without restriction. You will
   execute documents and take actions reasonably requested to perfect these
   rights. No license is granted to the Licensor's trademarks, service marks,
   or trade dress except as necessary to identify the Software.

5. Feedback and Usage Data
   You grant the Licensor a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free
   license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and otherwise exploit any
   feedback, suggestions, usage data, telemetry, or improvements you provide
   relating to the Software, without restriction or obligation to you.

6. Confidentiality and Security
   The Software (including its structure, interfaces, models, training data,
   weights, benchmarks, configurations, and performance data) constitutes the
   Licensor's confidential information. You will protect it using at least
   the same degree of care you use to protect your own confidential
   information and no less than reasonable care. You will implement
   appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent
   unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, and will promptly notify the
   Licensor of any actual or suspected unauthorized access or security
   incident involving the Software.

7. Compliance and Audit
   You will maintain complete and accurate records sufficient to demonstrate
   compliance with this Agreement and any usage limits. Upon reasonable
   notice, the Licensor may audit your use of the Software (directly or via a
   mutually agreed third party) to verify compliance. If an audit reveals
   unlicensed use, you will promptly pay additional fees and costs and take
   corrective actions required by the Licensor.

8. Third-Party Components
   The Software may include or depend on third-party open source components
   licensed under separate open source licenses. Those components are not
   licensed under this Enterprise License Agreement and remain subject to
   their respective licenses, as identified in the NOTICE / THIRD_PARTY file
   or applicable package metadata.

9. Export Compliance
   You represent and warrant that you are not located in, organized in, or a
   resident of any country or territory subject to comprehensive U.S.
   sanctions and that you will not export, re-export, or transfer the
   Software in violation of applicable export control or sanctions laws. You
   will promptly notify the Licensor of any export control inquiry relating
   to the Software.

10. Termination and Injunctive Relief
    The license granted herein terminates automatically upon expiration or
    termination of the applicable Commercial Agreement or upon any breach of
    this notice. Upon termination, you must immediately stop using the
    Software and destroy all copies in your possession or control. You agree
    that any unauthorized use of the Software or breach of Sections 3, 4, 6,
    or 9 will cause irreparable harm for which damages are an inadequate
    remedy, and the Licensor is entitled to seek injunctive relief in
    addition to any other remedies available at law or equity.

11. Disclaimer of Warranties
    UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE IS
    PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-
    INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR
    USAGE OF TRADE.

12. Limitation of Liability
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR OR
    ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR
    ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE
    DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT
    OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
    OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING
    TO THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE
    UNDER THE APPLICABLE COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS
    PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

13. Indemnity
    You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor and its
    affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, and agents from and
    against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses
    (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your
    use of the Software in violation of this Agreement or applicable law.

14. Governing Law
    Unless expressly stated otherwise in a Commercial Agreement, this notice
    is governed by the laws specified in that Commercial Agreement, without
    regard to conflict-of-law principles.
