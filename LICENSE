Topicality LLC, Topicality Summit, and Brian C. Long
All rights reserved.

This Agreement governs access to and use of the Topicality Summit software
and all accompanying documentation, models, data, and other deliverables
(the "Software") provided by Topicality LLC, Topicality Summit, and Brian C.
Long (collectively, the "Licensor"). Any rights not expressly granted are
reserved.

1. Commercial Agreement Required
Access to and use of the Software is conditioned on your prior acceptance of
and continued compliance with a written commercial agreement, order form, or
proof-of-concept agreement executed with the Licensor (a "Commercial
Agreement"). In the event of any conflict between this notice and a valid
Commercial Agreement, the terms of that Commercial Agreement control.

2. License Grant (Enterprise Use Only)
Subject to the Commercial Agreement and this notice, the Licensor grants you
a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
license to install and use the Software solely for your internal business
purposes. No other rights are granted by implication, estoppel, or
otherwise.

3. Restrictions (Non-Exhaustive)
Except as expressly authorized in a Commercial Agreement, you may not and
may not permit any third party to:
- provide the Software as a hosted, SaaS, platform, bureau, or timesharing
  service to any third party;
- use the Software to build, train, or improve any product or service that
  competes with or substitutes for the Software or the Licensor's products;
- copy, modify, fork, translate, adapt, decompile, disassemble, reverse
  engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to any source code,
  models, or trade secrets in the Software (except to the limited extent
  required by applicable law and only after providing prior written notice to
  the Licensor);
- remove, obscure, or modify any proprietary notices or security mechanisms;
- publish or disclose performance, benchmarking, or security test results
  without the Licensor's prior written consent;
- circumvent usage limits, licensing controls, or access restrictions;
- redistribute, resell, rent, lease, loan, sublicense, or otherwise transfer
  the Software (or any keys, tokens, or credentials) to any third party;
- use the Software to develop training data for any competitive AI/ML models
  or to mine, scrape, or extract proprietary parameters, prompts, or weights;
- use the Software in violation of applicable law, including export control,
  sanctions, privacy, or information security requirements; or
- deploy the Software in safety-critical or high-risk environments without
  a separate written agreement that expressly permits such use.

4. Ownership
The Software is licensed, not sold. The Licensor retains all right, title,
and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property
rights and any modifications or derivative works, regardless of who creates
or provides them.

5. Feedback
You grant the Licensor a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free
license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and otherwise exploit any
feedback, suggestions, or improvements you provide relating to the Software,
without restriction or obligation to you.

6. Third-Party Components
The Software may include or depend on third-party open source components
licensed under separate open source licenses. Those components are not
licensed under this Enterprise License Agreement and remain subject to their
respective licenses, as identified in the NOTICE / THIRD_PARTY file or
applicable package metadata.

7. Confidentiality
The Software (including its structure, interfaces, models, training data,
weights, benchmarks, and performance data) constitutes the Licensor's
confidential information. You will protect it using at least the same degree
of care you use to protect your own confidential information and no less
than reasonable care.

8. Export Compliance
You represent and warrant that you are not located in, organized in, or a
resident of any country or territory subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions
and that you will not export, re-export, or transfer the Software in
violation of applicable export control or sanctions laws. You will promptly
notify the Licensor of any export control inquiry relating to the Software.

9. Termination
The license granted herein terminates automatically upon expiration or
termination of the applicable Commercial Agreement or upon any breach of
this notice. Upon termination, you must immediately stop using the Software
and destroy all copies in your possession or control.

10. Disclaimer of Warranties
UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
"AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES
ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

11. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR OR ITS
affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, or agents BE LIABLE FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THE LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE
SOFTWARE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE UNDER THE
APPLICABLE COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE
EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

12. Governing Law
Unless expressly stated otherwise in a Commercial Agreement, this notice is
governed by the laws specified in that Commercial Agreement, without regard
to conflict-of-law principles.
