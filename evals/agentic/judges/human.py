    This could involve:
    1. Sending the `steps` and `rubric` to a dedicated human review UI.
    2. Waiting for a human to provide a judgment (pass/fail, score).
    3. Retrieving the human's decision from a queue or database.
    For MVP, you might read cached decisions by (workflow,input_id) from a file or simple key-value store.
    Later: add Web UI / Slack app for rapid adjudication.
