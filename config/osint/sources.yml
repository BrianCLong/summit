source_onboarding_checklist:
  - Confirm ToS explicitly allows automation or licensed API access.
  - Record approved collection methods and disallowed methods.
  - Capture rate limits, quotas, and backoff requirements.
  - Document licensing and redistribution constraints.
  - Validate provenance expectations and required metadata fields.
  - Assign reliability tier and review cadence.
  - Register privacy classification and retention TTLs.
  - Add negative-policy fixtures for new source rules.
  - Obtain human review sign-off for scope or rate-limit changes.
