# Phase 5: Cognitive Fabric & Global Mesh (Q2 2026)

**Mission:** Evolve IntelGraph into a self-organizing Cognitive Fabric that autonomously integrates data, respects time-travel semantics, and federates intelligence across sovereign boundaries.

## Backlog

### Epic: AGI-Ready Data Spine
- [ ] **Task #108: Semantic Consistency Engine.**
    - Implement `SemanticMapperService` to autonomously map raw data schemas to the IntelGraph Ontology using LLM reasoning.
    - Validate with a `SchemaDriftDrill`.
- [ ] **Task #109: Bitemporal Knowledge Repository.**
    - Implement `BitemporalService` to track both `valid_time` (when it happened) and `transaction_time` (when we recorded it) for graph entities.
    - Enable "Time-Travel" queries.

### Epic: Post-Quantum Security Implementation
- [ ] **Task #110: Quantum-Resistant Service Identity.**
    - Operationalize the PQC assessment (Task #103).
    - Implement `QuantumIdentityManager` using simulated Kyber/Dilithium encapsulation for service-to-service mutual TLS handshakes.

### Epic: Global Federation
- [ ] **Task #111: Federated Mesh Query Planner.**
    - Create `FederatedQueryPlanner` to decompose GraphQL/Cypher queries across multiple region-shards without centralizing data.
    - Implement "Push-Down Reasoning" to execute filters at the edge.

### Epic: Autonomous Evolution
- [ ] **Task #112: Self-Optimizing Ontology.**
    - Implement `OntologyEvolutionService` that suggests schema promotions based on high-frequency unstructured attributes.
    - Auto-migration of data to new schema versions.
