# Maestro Conductor GA — Final Implementation Summary (v2025.10.07)

**Status:** ✅ Complete & Production‑ready  
**Prepared by:** IntelGraph Maestro Conductor (MC)  
**Release Tag:** `v2025.10.07`  
**Date:** 2025‑10‑07

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary
A complete, auditable release artifact generation, attestation, and verification system has been implemented for **Maestro Conductor**. All deliverables pass verification and align with IntelGraph org defaults for provenance, SLOs, CI/CD quality gates, and compliance.

---

## 📁 Source of Truth: Core Scripts

### `scripts/gen-release-manifest.mjs`
- Generates machine‑readable **YAML** manifest with commit SHAs, artifact digests, and environment metadata.
- Zero external dependencies; auto‑discovers & hashes critical artifacts.

### `scripts/gen-release-attestation.mjs`
- Produces **JSON‑LD** verifiable credentials for standards‑friendly provenance.
- Pulls manifest YAML and inlines critical hashes; ready for **cosign/keyless** signing in CI.

### `scripts/verify-release-manifest.mjs`
- Re‑hashes artifacts and validates against the manifest for integrity & reproducibility.
- Usable locally and in CI as a **release gate**.

---

## ⚙️ GitHub Workflow

### `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml`
- On **tag push**, automatically:
  1) Generates release manifest & attestation  
  2) Verifies artifact integrity  
  3) Uploads all artifacts to the GitHub Release
- Zero‑config setup for **continuous provenance**.

## 🧰 Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release:manifest": "node scripts/gen-release-manifest.mjs",
    "release:attest": "node scripts/gen-release-attestation.mjs",
    "release:verify": "node scripts/verify-release-manifest.mjs"
  }
}

## 📦 Generated Artifacts

### 1) Release Manifest
- **File:** `dist/release-manifest-v2025.10.07.yaml`
- **Purpose:** Machine‑readable metadata (commit SHAs, artifact digests, environment/toolchain versions) for reproducible GA verification.
- **Includes:** SHA256 for critical artifacts; integrity verification status.

### 2) Release Attestation
- **File:** `dist/release-attestation-v2025.10.07.jsonld`
- **Purpose:** JSON‑LD verifiable credential for provenance validation.
- **Notes:** Extensible for cryptographic signing; **Sigstore/cosign** compatible.

### 3) Evidence Bundle
- **File:** `dist/evidence-v0.3.2-mc-nightly.json`
- **Purpose:** SLO + compliance verification bundle with SHA256 attestation & status.

### 4) Public GA Announcement
- **File:** `docs/releases/2025.10.07_MAESTRO_CONDUCTOR_GA_ANNOUNCEMENT.md`
- **Purpose:** External‑facing release announcement (LinkedIn, GitHub Releases, partners).  
- **Content:** Product overview, highlights, artifacts & verification, stability proof, contact info.

## 🚀 How to Release

### 1) Create & Push Tag
```bash
git tag v2025.10.07
git push origin v2025.10.07
```

### 2) (Optional) Manual Artifact Generation
```bash
TAG=v2025.10.07 npm run release:manifest
TAG=v2025.10.07 npm run release:attest
TAG=v2025.10.07 npm run release:verify
```

### 3) CI Automation
On tag push, the workflow generates the manifest & attestation, verifies integrity, and uploads all artifacts to the GitHub Release.

---

## 🛡️ Security, Provenance & Compliance
- **Artifact Integrity:** SHA256 hashes for all critical artifacts; reproducible builds with frozen deps.
- **Provenance Tracking:** Commit SHA tracking in manifest; JSON‑LD verifiable credentials; ready for **cosign/keyless**.
- **Compliance Reporting:** Evidence bundle with SLO verification, automated compliance status, retention policy enforcement.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration Points
- **Pre‑Build Gate:** Run `release:verify` to block tampered artifacts from entering the pipeline.
- **Post‑Build Attestation:** Generate manifest & attestation on successful build; attach to GitHub Release.
- **Release Gate:** Block promotion to production on any verification failure.

---

## 📊 Observability & SLO Alignment (Org Defaults)
- **API/GraphQL Gateway:** Reads p95 ≤ 350 ms, Writes p95 ≤ 700 ms; 99.9% monthly availability.
- **Graph Operations (Neo4j):** 1‑hop p95 ≤ 300 ms; 2–3 hops p95 ≤ 1,200 ms.
- **Ingest:** ≥ 1,000 events/s per pod; processing p95 ≤ 100 ms pre‑storage.
- **Error Budgets:** API 0.1% / month; Ingest 0.5% / month.
- **Monitoring Hooks:**
  - Release metrics (artifact generation success, verification pass/fail, pipeline latency)
  - Alerts for verification failures, missing artifacts, manifest errors

---

## 📚 Documentation Set
- Public GA Announcement (ready to publish)
- Technical Docs: Artifact generation, verification procedure, troubleshooting guide

---

## ✅ Definition of Done (DoD)
- All scripts, workflows, and artifacts implemented, versioned, and verified.
- CI gates in place; failure blocks promotion.
- Evidence bundle generated; provenance & integrity verifiable.
- Announcement ready for publication.

---

## ▶️ Next Steps
1. **Push Tag:** `v2025.10.07` to trigger CI workflow.
2. **Publish:** GA announcement to selected channels.
3. **Verify:** Stakeholders validate integrity via manifest & attestation.
4. **Monitor:** Enable alerts for verification failures and release metrics.
