# Adversarial Misinformation Defense Platform

A comprehensive platform for detecting and defending against adversarial misinformation across multiple modalities including text, images, audio, video, memes, and deepfakes.

## Overview

The Adversarial Misinformation Defense Platform is designed to combat sophisticated misinformation campaigns that leverage advanced AI techniques including deepfakes, coordinated inauthentic behavior, and multi-modal adversarial content generation. This platform provides cutting-edge detection capabilities, autonomous evolution mechanisms, and comprehensive validation suites.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Detection
- **Text Detection**: Advanced NLP techniques for identifying misleading narratives and adversarial text patterns
- **Image Detection**: Sophisticated analysis for manipulated images and visual misinformation
- **Audio Detection**: Deepfake audio detection and acoustic anomaly identification
- **Video Detection**: Temporal consistency checks and deepfake video analysis
- **Meme Detection**: Template recognition and caption analysis for meme-based misinformation
- **Deepfake Detection**: Comprehensive deepfake identification across all modalities

### 2. Autonomous Tactic Evolution
- Self-evolving detection libraries that adapt to new adversarial techniques
- Threat actor behavior modeling and prediction
- Continuous learning from adversarial samples

### 3. Adversarial Training
- GAN-based adversarial sample generation for model improvement
- Large Language Model (LLM) assisted detection library extension
- Continuous model refinement through adversarial training cycles

### 4. Red/Blue Team Operations
- Scenario builder UI for creating realistic adversarial exercises
- Comprehensive exercise management and tracking
- Performance evaluation and improvement recommendations

### 5. Validation Suite
- State-of-the-art benchmark comparisons
- Comprehensive performance metrics across all modalities
- Detailed reporting and improvement recommendations

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd adversarial-misinfo-defense-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage

```python
from adversarial_misinfo_defense import create_platform

# Create the complete platform
platform = create_platform()

# Use the detector
detector = platform['detector']

# Analyze text for misinformation
text_samples = [
    "This shocking revelation will change everything!",
    "Research shows balanced approaches are beneficial."
]

results = detector.detect_text_misinfo(text_samples)
print(results)
```

### 2. Running Validation

```python
from adversarial_misinfo_defense import ValidationBenchmark

# Create validation benchmark
validator = ValidationBenchmark()

# Run comprehensive validation
results = validator.run_comprehensive_validation()

# Generate report
report = validator.generate_validation_report(results)
print(report)
```

### 3. Starting Red/Blue Team Exercises

```python
from adversarial_misinfo_defense import RedBlueTeamExerciseManager

# Create exercise manager
exercise_manager = RedBlueTeamExerciseManager()

# Create a new scenario
scenario = exercise_manager.create_scenario(
    name="Social Media Influence Campaign",
    description="Simulate a coordinated social media influence operation",
    exercise_type=ExerciseType.SOCIAL_ENGINEERING,
    difficulty=ScenarioDifficulty.INTERMEDIATE,
    objectives=[
        "Detect coordinated account behavior",
        "Identify inauthentic engagement patterns",
        "Trace information flow manipulation"
    ]
)

# Start an exercise session
session = exercise_manager.start_exercise_session(
    scenario.scenario_id,
    participating_teams=[
        {"role": "red_team", "members": ["attacker1", "attacker2"]},
        {"role": "blue_team", "members": ["defender1", "defender2"]}
    ]
)
```
