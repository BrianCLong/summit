# 📜 Council Feature & Use‑Case Wishbook — **Volume II: The Summit Edition**
*Compiled under the chairmanship of Markus Wolf. This volume assumes Volume I and the Expanded & Exhaustive Edition as baseline. It introduces **new, non‑overlapping** capabilities that decisively outpace competing systems across tradecraft, integrity, governance, and operations. Ethical guardrails apply by default; unlawful harm is declined and redirected to defensive, compliant alternatives.*

---
## I) Executive Thesis
Our edge will come from three compounding advantages: **provable trust**, **auditable autonomy**, and **federated leverage**. Volume II delivers capabilities that other platforms don’t: **proof‑carrying analytics**, **cross‑tenant trust exchange without data handoff**, and **operator‑centric simulations** that turn analysis into accountable decisions.

**North‑Stars**
- Zero‑copy fusion across enclaves via **verifiable claims** rather than raw data movement.
- **Autonomous‑but‑auditable** agents that show prompts, parameters, paths, and proofs.
- **Counter‑deception by design**: adversarial ML labs, narrative stress tests, and response playbooks bound to authority and policy.

---
## II) Competitive Gap Slam (What no one else offers in one place)
1) **Proof‑Carrying Queries (PCQ)** — Every analytic result ships with cryptographic attestations (inputs, transforms, model versions) verifiable offline.
2) **Zero‑Knowledge Deconfliction** — Cross‑tenant collision checks (people/assets/selectors) using ZK proofs over salted, hashed features; no raw PII leaves the compartment.
3) **Authority‑Bound Reasoning** — A compiler that binds each step of analysis and export to explicit legal authorities, retention clocks, and license constraints; violations are unexecutable.
4) **Adversarial Narrative Lab** — Safe sandbox to pressure‑test campaigns and counter‑messaging with causal metrics and guardrails; measures collateral risk before action.
5) **Portable Provenance Wallets** — Per‑case, signed, revocable “evidence passports” for courts, partners, or the press; supports partial, audience‑scoped disclosure.
6) **Operator‑Grade Simulations** — Integrated COA + logistics + legal effects; produces decision logs with dissent capture and reproducibility seeds.
7) **Edge Autonomy Kits** — Fully disconnected triage/analysis with CRDT sync, policy stubs, and local PCQ; deterministic replay on reconnect.

## III) New Capability Pillars (Non‑Overlapping with Volume I)

### A) Verifiable Trust Fabric
- **A1. Proof‑Carrying Analytics (PCA)**  
  *What*: Every materialized view/result includes signed lineage, model cards, hyperparameters, and checksum trees; a one‑click verifier replays the DAG on synthetic fixtures.  
  *Why*: Courts, regulators, liaison partners demand evidentiary integrity.  
  *Acceptance*: External verifier reproduces results within tolerance; tamper alarm on any mismatch.

- **A2. Zero‑Knowledge Trust Exchange (ZK‑TX)**  
  *What*: ZK range/set proofs enable cross‑tenant checks (conflict, sanction exposure, watchlist overlap) without revealing values.  
  *Why*: Deconfliction at alliance scale without violating need‑to‑know.  
  *Acceptance*: Demonstrate true/false overlap proofs with zero leakage; audit shows only proofs and attestations.

- **A3. License/Authority Compiler (LAC)**  
  *What*: A static/dynamic analyzer that compiles case policies (licenses, warrants, DPAs) into query bytecode; unsafe ops cannot execute.  
  *Why*: Compliant by construction beats audit after the fact.  
  *Acceptance*: 100% policy hit‑rate on test corpus; diff simulator shows impact of proposed policy changes.

- **A4. Provenance Wallets & Selective Disclosure**  
  *What*: Portable, time‑boxed evidence bundles with claim graphs, signatures, and audience filters (press, court, partner).  
  *Why*: Share proof, not your whole database.  
  *Acceptance*: External validator accepts/flags any modification; revocation propagates on next open.

### B) Auditable Autonomy & Agents
- **B1. Glass‑Box Agents**  
  *What*: Agents run with fully recorded prompts, tool calls, datasets, and XAI overlays; analysts can step, edit, or fork runs.  
  *Why*: Autonomy without opacity.  
  *Acceptance*: Any agent run is replayable; parameter diffs change outputs predictably within tolerance.

- **B2. Runbook Provers**  
  *What*: Each runbook emits a machine‑checkable proof of preconditions (legal basis, data license, scope) and postconditions (KPIs met, citations present).  
  *Why*: Replace brittle checklists with verifiable gates.  
  *Acceptance*: Failing a gate blocks export and raises ombuds review.

- **B3. Adversarial ML Red‑Team**  
  *What*: One‑click adversarial evaluation (prompt injection, data poisoning, correlation leakage) with auto‑mitigations and regression baselines.  
  *Why*: Attack your own models before others do.  
  *Acceptance*: Bench shows measurable robustness deltas; red‑team runs are archived as proofs.

- **B4. Reasoning‑Trace Signatures**  
  *What*: Deterministic reasoning traces (summaries, not raw sensitive text) are hashed and signed to deter silent manipulation.  
  *Why*: Protects against insider tampering and model drift gaslighting.  
  *Acceptance*: Any change triggers hash mismatches and requires dual‑control override.

### C) Federated Leverage without Data Movement
- **C1. Multi‑Graph Federation (No‑Copy)**  
  *What*: Query planners push down predicates to remote graphs; only aggregates/claims return with proofs.  
  *Why*: Unlock partner value without violating sovereignty.  
  *Acceptance*: End‑to‑end latency targets met on cross‑org queries; leakage tests pass.

- **C2. Cross‑Domain Simulation Market**  
  *What*: Pluggable COA simulators (epidemiological, financial contagion, supply corridors, information cascades) that consume only anonymized features/claims.  
  *Acceptance*: Simulator outputs include sensitivity bars and debiasing notes; partners can certify models.

- **C3. Liaison Escrow & Redaction Contracts**  
  *What*: Escrow spaces with auto‑redaction policies and revocation timers for time‑bounded collaboration.  
  *Acceptance*: Revocation wipes derived material outside contractual windows; logs prove compliance.

### D) Counter‑Deception & Integrity at Scale
- **D1. Synthetic Fabrication Radar**  
  *What*: Multi‑modal fabrication patterns (metadata incongruities, stylometry non‑biometric, sensor sanity) with source streaks and contradiction graphs.  
  *Acceptance*: False‑positive ceilings on labeled corpora; operator can cite why a claim is suspect.

- **D2. Narrative Causality Tester**  
  *What*: Counterfactual experiments that measure whether interventions (messages, takedowns, sanctions) plausibly change downstream indicators.  
  *Acceptance*: Causal uplift/confidence bands + risk‑of‑harm meters are mandatory before action.

- **D3. Honey‑leak & Canary Trial Orchestrator**  
  *What*: Automated watermarks, decoy trails, and controlled leaks to map adversary collection without causing harm.  
  *Acceptance*: Telemetry loop attributes collection paths; policy prevents real‑world damage.

### E) Human‑Systems Excellence
- **E1. Dissent Ledger & Ombuds Workflow**  
  *What*: First‑class dissent capture-per‑decision with search and citation in briefs; ombuds queues and precedent catalog.  
  *Acceptance*: Briefs must render dissent excerpts; unresolved dissents block high‑risk actions.

- **E2. Analyst Mastery Tracks**  
  *What*: Credentialed training (Analyst I/II, Operator, Ombudsman) with labs and replayable scenarios; agent‑assisted coaching.  
  *Acceptance*: Certification tied to reduced time‑to‑insight and error rates.

- **E3. Integrity Tripwires (Abuse‑of‑Power Dampeners)**  
  *What*: Behavioral analytics for over‑broad queries, fishing expeditions, or selector misuse with just‑in‑time education and escalation.  
  *Acceptance*: Tripwire activation decreases over time with coaching; appeals logged.

### F) Ops, Cost & Sustainability
- **F1. Unit‑Cost Governor**  
  *What*: Budget‑aware planners throttle heavy queries and suggest cheaper equivalent paths; shows $/insight.  
  *Acceptance*: 20–40% cost reduction on benchmark workloads with equal accuracy.

- **F2. Energy‑Aware Scheduling**  
  *What*: Batch analytics aligned to green/low‑cost windows; opt‑in carbon budgets per tenant.  
  *Acceptance*: Reported energy usage per case; carbon budget alerts.

- **F3. Chaos‑with‑Consequences**  
  *What*: Controlled fault injection tied to real incident runbooks; auto‑lessons and SLA repair tasks.  
  *Acceptance*: SLO breaches trend downward quarter‑over‑quarter.

### G) Experience Innovations (Analyst Delight)
- **G1. Tri‑Pane ++**  
  *What*: Live **Cause/Effect** overlays across graph ↔ map ↔ timeline; drag any assumption to see ripple effects.  
  *Acceptance*: Time‑to‑COA comparison reduced by ≥30% in trials.

- **G2. Explain‑This‑Decision**  
  *What*: Any brief paragraph can reveal its evidence map, dissent nodes, and policy bindings.  
  *Acceptance*: Zero uncited assertions allowed in published outputs.

- **G3. “What Changed?” Diff Everywhere**  
  *What*: Entity/claim/view diffs with human‑readable summaries and risk deltas; subscribe to diffs.  
  *Acceptance*: Investigators resolve alerts with <2% churn.
