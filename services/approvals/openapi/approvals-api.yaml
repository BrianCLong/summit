    Policy-Gated Approvals API for high-risk operations.

    This API provides a centralized approval workflow for operations that require

    logged to the provenance ledger with signed receipts.

        Creates a new approval request for a high-risk operation.

        The request is evaluated against OPA policies to determine:
        - Whether approval is required
        - How many approvals are needed
        - Which roles can approve
        - Any time constraints or conditions

        Supports idempotency via the `X-Idempotency-Key` header.
