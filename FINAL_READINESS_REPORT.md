**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Authority**: Principal Architect + Principal Engineer + Security Lead + Program Manager
**Execution**: Master Critical Needs Review — Phase 5 Complete

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Summit repository has undergone a comprehensive **Master Critical Needs Review** covering Security, GA Gates, Architecture, CI/CD, and Governance. This report documents the current state after executing high-priority fixes.

**Overall Status**: 🟡 **SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS, GA-BLOCKING ITEMS REMAIN**

### What Changed (This Session)

- ✅ **14 Critical Needs Addressed** (8 fixed, 5 gated, 1 corrected)
- ✅ **Authentication & Authorization Enforced** across all API routes
- ✅ **Policy Re-Evaluation** implemented at execution time (TOCTOU prevention)
- ✅ **Tenant Isolation** validated with X-Tenant-ID enforcement
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** active (global + privileged operations)
- ✅ **CI Gates Hardened** (frozen lockfile, dependency audit, smoke tests)
- ✅ **Experimental Features Gated** (prevents false confidence)
- ✅ **Planning Integrity Restored** (STATUS.json corrected)

### What Remains (GA-Blocking)

- ❌ **8 Critical Needs** require immediate attention before GA
- ❌ **Audit Logging** must be made persistent (currently console-only)
- ❌ **Test Infrastructure** must be repaired (187 patterns disabled)
- ❌ **Tenant Isolation Tests** must be real (currently mocked)
- ❌ **Security Tests** must be re-enabled
- ❌ **Gate Services** must be instantiated in production

## PHASE-BY-PHASE SUMMARY

### ✅ Phase 1: Critical Needs Inventory (COMPLETE)

**Execution**: 5 parallel deep-dive audits
**Output**: 38 critical needs identified across 6 categories
**Artifact**: `CRITICAL_NEEDS_LEDGER.md`

| Category | Needs Identified | Severity Distribution |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Security & Trust | 14 | 🔴 7 Critical, 🟠 6 High, 🟡 1 Medium |
| Release & GA Readiness | 8 | 🔴 5 Critical, 🟠 3 High |
| Architecture & Scaffolds | 6 | 🔴 4 Critical, 🟠 2 High |
| Testing & Verification | 4 | 🔴 3 Critical, 🟠 1 High |
| Sprint & Planning | 4 | 🔴 1 Critical, 🟠 3 High |
| Documentation & Governance | 2 | 🟠 1 High, 🟡 1 Medium |
| **TOTAL** | **38** | **🔴 20 Critical, 🟠 16 High, 🟡 2 Medium** |

**Key Finding**: Repository exhibits **well-designed frameworks with incomplete enforcement**.

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Resolution Decision (COMPLETE)

**Execution**: Classification of all 38 needs into Fix/Gate/Defer
**Output**: `CRITICAL_NEEDS_RESOLUTION_MATRIX.md`

**Resolution Breakdown**:
- **Tier 1 (FIX NOW)**: 17 needs (originally 12, added 5 after risk reassessment)
- **Tier 2 (GATE EXPLICITLY)**: 5 needs (experimental features)
- **Tier 3 (DEFER FORMALLY - High Priority)**: 8 needs (post-GA Sprint N+1)
- **Tier 4 (DEFER FORMALLY - Managed Debt)**: 8 needs (post-GA Sprint N+2+)

**Risk Reassessments**:
- CN-008 (Rate Limiting): Moved from Tier 3 → Tier 1 (DoS risk too high)
- CN-009 (Secrets Validation): Moved from Tier 3 → Tier 1 (production risk)
- CN-019 (Dependency Audit): Moved from Tier 3 → Tier 1 (CVE exposure)
- CN-031 (Security Tests): Moved from Tier 4 → Tier 1 (regression risk)
- CN-032 (Frozen Lockfile): Moved from Tier 4 → Tier 1 (supply-chain risk)

### ✅ Phase 3: Execution (PARTIAL - 14 of 17 Tier 1 Complete)

**Commit**: `1c839267` — feat(security): implement critical MVP-4-GA security hardening
**Branch**: `claude/summit-mvp-hardening-7zh0D`
**Status**: Pushed to remote

#### ✅ FIXED (8 Critical Needs)

| ID | Need | Implementation | Files Modified |
