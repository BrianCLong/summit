# Recommendation Contract

Summit evaluates recommendations, not vice versa. Missing fields = automatic rejection.

Every recommendation must declare:

1.  **Inputs Declared**: What data was used to generate this?
2.  **Assumptions Explicit**: What is being assumed true?
3.  **Confidence Bounded**: Statistical confidence (0.0 - 1.0).
4.  **Counterfactuals Included**: What happens if we do nothing?
5.  **Alternative Hypotheses**: What else could this be?
6.  **Known Failure Modes**: Where is this model weak?
