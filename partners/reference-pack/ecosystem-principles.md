# The Summit Ecosystem Manifesto

> Summit enables an ecosystem of innovation **without outsourcing authority**.

We believe:

- Decisions should be explainable
- Authority should be attributable
- Automation should be governed
- Evidence should outlive people

Therefore:

1. Summit alone decides.
2. Partners may inform, never command.
3. No ecosystem participant can bypass evidence or policy.
4. Refusal is not failure.
5. Economic incentives must not distort judgment.

We welcome partners who increase clarity.
We reject those who seek control.

This will not change.
