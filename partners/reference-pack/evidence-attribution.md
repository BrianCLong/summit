# Evidence Attribution

Every external contribution must be tagged with:
*   **Provider identity**: Who are you?
*   **Version**: Which version of your model/tool?
*   **Confidence bounds**: How sure are you?
*   **Usage context**: Where should this be used?

This enables tracking of your performance over time.
