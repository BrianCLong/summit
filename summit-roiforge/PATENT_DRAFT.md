# PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION: ROIForge

**TITLE:** Unified Agentic Decisioning Platform with Quantum-Resilient Governance and Autonomous ROI Optimization

**INVENTORS:** [Agent Name], [User Name]

## ABSTRACT

A unified software platform ("ROIForge") for orchestrating autonomous AI agent teams in enterprise environments. The system integrates a decisioning core based on directed cyclic graphs (LangGraph/AutoGen) with a real-time Return on Investment (ROI) engine that dynamically adjusts agent behavior to maximize economic outcomes. Crucially, the platform embeds "GovShield," a governance layer utilizing post-quantum cryptographic primitives (Kyber and Dilithium) to secure audit trails and inter-agent communication against future quantum threats, while simultaneously enforcing bias detection standards (NIST/FICO) in real-time.

## BACKGROUND

Current agentic AI adoption is stalled by the "ROI Paradox" (high investment, unclear returns) and security concerns regarding autonomous decision-making in regulated industries (BFSI, Healthcare). Existing solutions lack integrated feedback loops between economic performance and agent behavior, and fail to address the looming threat of quantum decryption to long-term audit logs.

## SUMMARY OF INVENTION

ROIForge addresses these deficiencies via three coupled subsystems:
1.  **The Decision Core**: A multi-agent orchestrator that assigns roles (Approver, Monitor, Executor) and manages state across complex workflows.
2.  **The ROI Engine**: A telemetry system that computes efficiency uplift, cost savings, and cycle time reduction, feeding these metrics back into the Decision Core to optimize routing and resource allocation.
3.  **GovShield**: A security wrapper that enforces policy compliance and signs all critical decisions with quantum-resistant signatures, ensuring immutable, future-proof provenance.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### 1. Unified Agentic Decisioning
The system utilizes a graph-based execution model where agents are nodes and communication paths are edges. Agents utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason but are constrained by deterministic policy gates.

### 2. Autonomous ROI Optimization
Unlike passive dashboards, the ROI Engine actively influences the system. If the "Efficiency Uplift" metric drops below a threshold (e.g., 40%), the system automatically reconfigures agent teams (e.g., changing from a consensus model to a single-leader model) to recover performance.

### 3. Quantum-Resilient Governance
To protect against "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks, all decision metadata is signed using a hybrid scheme combining classical ECC and post-quantum algorithms (Kyber/Dilithium). This ensures that audit trails created today remain verifiable in the post-quantum era.

## CLAIMS

1.  A method for autonomous enterprise decision-making comprising:
    a. Instantiating a team of specialized AI agents.
    b. Measuring the economic outcome of agent decisions in real-time.
    c. Dynamically modifying agent interaction patterns based on said economic outcomes.
2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising wrapping all inter-agent messages in a quantum-resistant cryptographic envelope.
3.  A system for enforcing regulatory compliance in autonomous agents, utilizing a parallel "Monitor Agent" that validates outputs against formal logic policies (OPA) before execution.
