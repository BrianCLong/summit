# Sprint 28 — Lineage Evidence

Artifacts here prove Epic D lineage instrumentation.

Include:

- `event-schema.json`: canonical lineage event schema covering outputs, inputs, job metadata, actor, trace, and policy version.
- `sample-events.ndjson`: representative lineage events for export pack creation and background jobs.
- `query-examples.md`: example queries for the lineage endpoint, including expected results for a dataset ID.
- `graph-visualization.png` or `.json`: depiction of lineage relationships for at least one export.

Ensure samples are deterministic and document any fixtures used to generate them.
