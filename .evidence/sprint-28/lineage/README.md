# Sprint 28 — Lineage Evidence

This folder stores provenance artifacts for Epic D (lineage MVP).

Include:

- `lineage-event.schema.json`: JSON schema for lineage events.
- `lineage-events.ndjson`: deterministic sample lineage events for exports and background jobs.
- `lineage-query-response.json`: sample response for a lineage query.
- `lineage-graph.mmd`: simple graph visualization in Mermaid syntax.

Every artifact should be deterministic and redact secrets. Keep timestamps in ISO-8601.
