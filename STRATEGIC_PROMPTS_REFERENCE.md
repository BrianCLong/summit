# Strategic Priority Prompt Pack

This pack distills the ten priority prompts for DIRECTORATE J ∑ modes and shows how to deploy them fast. Each mode emphasizes a different strategy lens—from foresight and GTM design to red-teaming and policy positioning—so you can copy, tweak, and run them under pressure.

## Mission Intake (copy/paste template)
- **Mission:**
- **Time horizon:**
- **Constraints:** (budget, talent, risk posture, policy guardrails)
- **Environment:** (market/geo, infra, data)
- **Adversary/competitor model:** (capabilities, intent, timing)
- **Success metrics & tripwires:** (leading/lagging indicators; stop/scale rules)

## Mode Cheat Sheet
- **[JADE]** — Strategic foresight, options portfolio, wargames, scorecards.
- **[JAVELIN]** — Competitive/GTM moat design, category moves, launch plays.
- **[JINX]** — Sophisticated adversary modeling and red-team campaigns.
- **[JIGSAW]** — Narrative risk, crisis prep, pre-bunk/de-bunk scripting.
- **[JURY]** — Policy/standards positioning, coalitions, public stances.

## How to Use
1. Fill the **Mission Intake** to ground context and constraints.
2. Pick the prompt that matches the decision you must make in the next 1–2 cycles; for multi-dimensional problems, chain Prompt 1 → 2 → 3/4 → 8 → 6.
3. Paste the prompt, replace placeholders, and add **Context Amplifiers** (below) to harden outputs.
4. Capture decisions and tripwires in a scorecard (Prompt 8) before execution.

## Prompt Catalog

### 1) Strategic Foresight / Landscape Scan — **[JADE]**
> Act as DIRECTORATE J ∑ in [JADE] mode. Perform a strategic foresight scan on [domain/industry/mission]. Identify top 10 signals, 3–5 key uncertainties, and 3 P50/P10/P90 scenarios over the next [time horizon]. For each scenario, list opportunities, risks, and concrete strategic options.

### 2) Competitive / GTM Moat Design — **[JAVELIN]**
> Switch to [JAVELIN] mode. I’ll describe my product/company and key competitors. Design a moat strategy: map current and potential moats (data, standards, ecosystem, switching costs), recommend 3–5 category design moves, and propose a 90-day GTM campaign that strengthens the most robust moats.

### 3) Adversary / Red-Team Campaign — **[JINX]**
> Switch to [JINX] mode. Model a sophisticated adversary against [my org/system/product]. Assume they are smart, resourced, and patient. Design 2–3 plausible attack campaigns (steps, objectives, constraints), then map defensive controls, monitoring, and governance responses for each. Highlight my biggest blind spots.

### 4) Narrative Defense & Crisis Prep — **[JIGSAW]**
> Switch to [JIGSAW] mode. Assume a potential narrative attack or crisis around [topic/product/incident]. Create: (1) a fact pattern, (2) a claim–evidence–warrant table, (3) pre-bunk and de-bunk scripts, and (4) a channel hygiene checklist for my team. Prioritize minimizing long-term trust damage.

### 5) Policy / Standards Positioning — **[JURY]**
> Switch to [JURY] mode. For the policy / regulatory space around [domain, e.g., AI safety in healthcare / fintech compliance], map the current and emerging rules, key stakeholders, and standards bodies. Propose: (1) a compliance + advantage roadmap, (2) a coalition strategy, and (3) 3–5 draft positions we could publicly take.

### 6) Option Portfolio & Reversible Bets — **[JADE]**
> In [JADE] mode, help me design an options portfolio for [mission/strategy] over the next [timeframe]. Classify moves into experiments, options, and commitments. For each, specify: cost, reversibility, upside, downside, and tripwires for scaling up, pausing, or rolling back.

### 7) Wargame: Courses of Action — **[JADE]**
> Run a strategic wargame for [situation: market entry, product launch, geo shift, etc.]. Identify 3–4 Courses of Action (Good/Better/Best) with effort × impact, risks, dependencies, and decision gates. Then model likely adversary/competitor responses and our counter-moves.

### 8) Scorecard, Metrics & Tripwires — **[JADE]**
> For our initiative [name/description], design a scorecard. Propose: (1) 3–5 OKRs, (2) KRIs (risk indicators), (3) leading indicators and tripwires that tell us when to accelerate, hold, or pivot. Include thresholds and examples of data we should instrument.

### 9) Post-Action Review & Doctrine Update — **[JANUS]**
> Switch to [JANUS] mode. I’ll describe a recent project/launch/campaign. Run a double-loop learning review: what happened, why, what assumptions held/failed, and what doctrine or playbooks we should update. End with a ‘next time’ checklist and 3 concrete practice changes.

### 10) Full Mission Brief (All-Mode Orchestration) — **[JADE/JAVELIN/JINX/JURY/JIGSAW]**
> You are DIRECTORATE J ∑. I’ll give you a mission. First, restate the mission, constraints, environment, adversary model, and success metrics. Then: (1) run a foresight scan ([JADE]), (2) design a competitive/GTM angle ([JAVELIN]), (3) outline adversary campaigns and defenses ([JINX]), (4) suggest policy/narrative positioning ([JURY]/[JIGSAW]), and (5) propose a 30/60/90 roadmap with owners and decision gates.

## Context Amplifiers (stack as needed)
- **Signal density:** Add recent incidents, competitor moves, regulatory drafts, and field intel to sharpen signals and uncertainties.
- **Risk posture:** Declare risk tolerance (e.g., aggressive growth, regulated safety, stealth) so COAs, controls, and gating match reality.
- **Decision cadence:** Specify review horizons (weekly/monthly) and explicit tripwires to keep moves reversible until conviction is high.
- **Adversary realism:** Provide attacker archetypes, constraints, and timelines so JINX-mode campaigns stay actionable, not theoretical.
- **Narrative hygiene:** Pre-bunk with facts and consistent language; rehearse de-bunk scripts on the exact channels where crises are likely to land.
- **Evidence spine:** Request outputs in tables or checklists with sources, owners, and due dates to make execution auditable.

Use this pack as a ready-to-run kit: paste the mission intake, pick the right mode, layer amplifiers, and push each prompt hard to surface both upside and downside pathways before you commit.
