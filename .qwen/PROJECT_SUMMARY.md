# Project Summary

## Overall Goal

Implement a comprehensive Adversarial Misinformation Defense Platform with multi-modal detection, autonomous tactic evolution, adversarial training, and red/blue team exercise capabilities.

## Key Knowledge

- Platform implements detection across 6 modalities: text, image, audio, video, memes, and deepfakes
- Uses Python with PyTorch, Transformers, OpenCV, and other ML libraries
- Core components include:
  - Multi-modal detection modules with adversarial sample generation
  - Autonomous tactic evolution with threat actor modeling
  - Adversarial training with GANs and LLMs
  - Red/Blue team exercise management with scenario builder UI
  - Validation suite against state-of-the-art attacks
- All code organized in `/adversarial-misinfo-defense-platform/` directory
- Key files include main detector, adversarial training engine, tactic evolution, red/blue team manager

## Recent Actions

- Created complete adversarial misinformation defense platform implementation
- Implemented all required detection modules (text, image, audio, video, memes, deepfakes)
- Built autonomous tactic evolution system with threat actor mutation tracking
- Developed adversarial training with GANs and LLMs for extending detection libraries
- Created operational Red/Blue Team Module with scenario builder UI
- Generated validation suite with benchmarks against state-of-the-art attacks
- Produced comprehensive documentation including README, user guide, and patent claim checklist
- Successfully committed all platform files to `enhance/cognitive-bias-mitigation` branch
- Pushed changes to remote repository
