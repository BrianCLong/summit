# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Prepare, finalize, and package a production-ready release of the Summit/IntelGraph orchestration that runs locally via Docker, in the cloud (AWS), and in a localâ†”AWS hybrid mode with comprehensive observability.

## Key Knowledge
- **Repository paths & constraints**: Work from `/home/blong/Developer/summit/ops/compose`, all shell commands must be runnable from this directory, no sudo allowed, Docker & docker compose available with BuildKit
- **Baseline working features**: Click pinned for Py<3.10 (`click==8.1.8`), reproducible web build with `npm ci`, compose interpolation fix (`${NEO4J_PASSWORD}` instead of `${NEO4J_AUTH#neo4j/}`), ports: Web: `15173:8080`, API: `18080`, Grafana: `33000`
- **Observability stack**: Prometheus with blackbox job probing API health and Neo4j, Alert rules for Neo4jDown and APIHealthFailing, Alertmanager with stdout receiver, Blackbox exporter
- **Service naming convention**: Unified to `prom` instead of `prometheus` for consistency
- **Neo4j auth**: Plain `NEO4J_PASSWORD` in `.env` with compose building `NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/${NEO4J_PASSWORD}`
- **Web build**: Node 22 container with `npm ci` and optional `npm@10` pin, preserving `npm start` runtime contract

## Recent Actions
- **[DONE]** Created comprehensive Docker Compose orchestration with services: neo4j, api, web, prom, alertmanager, blackbox, grafana, and aws-credentials-sidecar
- **[DONE]** Implemented observability stack with proper Prometheus rules mounting, alertmanager no-op receiver configuration, and blackbox exporter setup
- **[DONE]** Released v0.3.0 with complete changelog, GitHub release, and provenance tracking
- **[DONE]** Created helper scripts for permission fixes (non-sudo), web lock regeneration, port/env tuning, and smoke testing
- **[DONE]** Established AWS/hybrid profile support via Docker Compose profiles with credentials sidecar
- **[DONE]** Post-release hardening with branch protection (release/0.3.x), supply chain infrastructure, Makefile helpers, and hotfix driver script
- **[DONE]** Fixed critical Docker Compose issues: removed top-level profiles (invalid spec), unified service naming to `prom`, proper alert rules mounting, clean Neo4j auth configuration

## Current Plan
1. **[DONE]** Complete v0.3.0 release with observability stack (Prometheus, Alertmanager, Blackbox, Grafana)
2. **[DONE]** Implement AWS/hybrid profile support via Docker Compose with credentials sidecar
3. **[DONE]** Create comprehensive release automation and validation scripts
4. **[DONE]** Perform post-release hardening with branch protection and supply chain infrastructure
5. **[DONE]** Establish hotfix process and release checklist templates for future releases
