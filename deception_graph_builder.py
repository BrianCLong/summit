"""Utilities for generating deceptive subgraphs within IntelGraph.

This module creates honeypot infrastructure entities and links them to
real nodes via `DECOY_OF` edges. Each decoy is watermarked with
`deception_level`, `trap_type`, and `bait_score` metadata so that the
counter‑response agent can reason about the trap that was laid.
