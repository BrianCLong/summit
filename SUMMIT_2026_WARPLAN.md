1. One-line 2026 vision that will make investors and IC evaluators instantly say “holy shit”
Open-source Gotham that fuses offline-first graph intel, local LLM copilots, tamper-evident provenance, and revenue-grade plugin rails so any field team gets Palantir-grade tradecraft in five minutes without the cloud.

2. Exactly four non-negotiable strategic pillars (no more, no less)
- Air-gapped-by-default analyst copilot (local LLMs + offline toolchain) that preserves the 5-minute golden path and never phones home. Includes reproducible model packs, deterministic embeddings, and GPU-aware fallback paths for CPU-only kits.
- Plugin + federation marketplace (MISP/STIX/TAXII, SIGMA, SOC/SIEM connectors, data/model packs) that monetizes integrations and crowds in ecosystem gravity. Shipping with signed SDK templates, automated compatibility tests, and revenue-share billing gates.
- Mobile & disconnected ops suite (sync-first edge clients, rugged packaging, secure mesh replication) that keeps LE/red-team/OSINT ops live when connectivity dies. Guarantees conflict-free replication, tamper-evident audit, and portable task bundles for field agents.
- Enterprise-grade assurances (support SLAs, SBOM+signing, policy/RBAC, red-team hardening, certs) that unlock contracts and SBIR/OTA dollars. Includes FIPS-bound cryptography options, section 508/NIAP readiness, and repeatable ATO kits.

Execution elaboration for immediate build: (a) pre-bake local LLM packs with deterministic quantization; (b) ship plugin-scaffold CLI that emits signed manifests; (c) deliver STIX/TAXII sync with per-peer cert rotation; (d) bundle CRDT-based mobile sync agent; (e) finalize RBAC mapping for IdP adapters (OIDC/SAML/LDAP); (f) wire supply-chain signing via cosign + SBOM attestation; (g) light hosted exchange with opt-in data coop controls; (h) rugged NUC/EdgeTPU kit bill of materials; (i) UEBA/insider-risk models tuned offline; (j) SBIR bid kit with evidence tree; (k) sidecar observability using eBPF exporters; (l) auditor kit with canned evidence captures.

4. Zero-trust / air-gap red lines that will cause immediate veto if violated
- Any dependency on external APIs for default copilot; must run Phi-3/Llama-3.1/Mistral/DeepSeek locally via Ollama/Open WebUI with no telemetry and reproducible model hashes.
- Network egress disabled by default in air-gapped deploys; all plugins must declare and respect egress policies with enforced allowlists and offline fallbacks.
- No feature may add >5 minutes to first-run offline install (pre-baked model bundles, signed container layers, zero online pulls for golden path).
- All connectors and plugins must be signed, hash-locked, reproducibly built, and runnable without outbound calls; auto-update is manual-only in air-gapped mode with audited provenance.
- No centralized multi-tenant control plane; federation uses signed, peer-to-peer STIX/TAXII/MISP sync with per-peer trust fabric and kill-switchable certificates.

5. Community flywheels & network effects that must be ignited in parallel
- Bounty-backed plugin weeks: pay $1–5k per validated connector (Maltego, Elastic, Splunk, Sentinel, MISP, CrowdStrike, Recorded Future) to drive PRs, stars, and marketplace density.
- “5-minute Gotham” challenge: social + livestreams showing cold-start to intel graph with local LLM in <5 minutes; reward reusable Taskfiles/Taskfiles and publish a weekly leaderboard.
- Reference playbooks for each market (journalist leak triage, fusion center BOLO graph, insider-risk UEBA, red-team recon, vuln-chain hunt) published as importable recipes with sample data.
- Leaderboarded threat-exchange nodes (opt-in): score contributors on IOC quality/freshness; highlight top community operators and rotate into a “trusted feeds” bundle.
- Field operator council (LE/red-team/journo) providing quarterly feedback; invite-only Discord with rapid patch SLA, roadmap veto power, and early access to paid bundles.
- “Certified plugin” track with automated attestation and security review; badge in marketplace plus rev-share uplift to incentivize quality ISVs.

6. Sustainable business model stack ranked by 2026 revenue potential (be brutally specific: SBIR, commercial support contracts, hosted SaaS, on-prem enterprise license, etc.)
1) On-prem enterprise license + platinum support (LE fusion, corp TI) — $250–500k ACV with hard SLAs, compliance attestations, FIPS/NIAP paths, and certified plugins.
2) DoD/IC SBIR Phase II/III + OTA task orders — $1–5M non-dilutive for air-gapped, attestable builds, operator training, and secure supply-chain guarantees.
3) Hosted graph exchange SaaS (opt-in data coop) — $50–150/user/month plus data revenue share for curated feeds; upsell private enclave hosting for ISVs.
4) Plugin marketplace revenue share — 20–30% take on paid connectors/models; enterprise bundles for compliance-validated plugins and per-seat identity enforcement.
5) Field-kit hardware bundles — ruggedized NUC/Edge TPU kits with preloaded Summit + offline models at $5–10k/unit plus yearly support and crypto-signed update media.
6) Incident-response/forensics retainers — $50–200k/yr for red-team/IR partners leveraging Summit playbooks; include surge staffing SLAs and post-incident hardening reports.
7) Premium training/credentialing — $5–15k cohort-based “Summit Operator” and “Summit Integrator” programs with badged completion and procurement-friendly certificates.
