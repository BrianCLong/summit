title: Assign release captain and update release calendar for 2025-W51
labels: [release-train, P0]
owner: ops-captain

## Context

The release-train discipline workflow expects an assigned captain and updated calendar entry each week, but no owner or calendar link exists for 2025-W51.

## Acceptance criteria

- A named release captain is recorded in `issues/release-train/release-train-2025-w51.md` and acknowledged in the team calendar entry for the W51 promotion window.
- The calendar entry includes the promotion cadence (stage soak → prod10 → prod50 → prod100) and on-call contacts.
- A comment on the release-train tracker links to the calendar event and confirms backup owner coverage.
