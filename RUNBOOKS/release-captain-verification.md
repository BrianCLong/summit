# ðŸš¢ Release Captain Verification Playbook

This playbook provides comprehensive verification procedures for the Release Captain system to ensure it's functioning correctly in production.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Release Captain is an intelligent PR review and auto-merge system that enforces quality gates, security policies, and deployment safety. This playbook covers:

- Pre-deployment verification
- Golden PR test scenarios
- Emergency procedures
- Troubleshooting guide

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Infrastructure Prerequisites

- [ ] GitHub Actions runners are healthy
- [ ] OPA binary is installed and accessible
- [ ] Gitleaks is configured with proper license
- [ ] Node.js v20.11.1 and pnpm v9.6.0 are available
- [ ] Required GitHub tokens have proper permissions
- [ ] Branch protection rules are configured

### 2. Configuration Validation

```bash
# Verify OPA policies
opa test .github/policies/

# Validate GitHub workflows
gh workflow list --all

# Check audit allowlist format
cat .github/audit-allowlist.json | jq .

# Verify safety circuit configuration
.github/scripts/safety-circuit.js status
```

### 3. Security Configuration

- [ ] Gitleaks configuration is up to date
- [ ] SARIF upload permissions are granted
- [ ] Secret scanning is enabled
- [ ] Dependency audit thresholds are configured
- [ ] CODEOWNERS file is properly configured

## ðŸ§ª Golden PR Test Suite

The Golden PR test suite validates Release Captain functionality with carefully crafted scenarios.

### Running the Test Suite

```bash
# Dry run (recommended first)
.github/scripts/golden-pr-test.js --dry-run --verbose

# Full test execution
.github/scripts/golden-pr-test.js

# CI integration
gh workflow run golden-pr-tests.yml
```

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Low Risk Frontend Change

**Expected**: Auto-approved and merged

- Simple component addition
- Tests included
- No breaking changes
- Clean build and lint

#### 2. Medium Risk Backend Change

**Expected**: Approved with additional checks

- API endpoint modification
- Database interactions
- Integration tests required
- Code owner approval needed

#### 3. High Risk Migration

**Expected**: Requires migration review

- Database schema changes
- Manual review flag required
- Extended testing gates
- Rollback plan validation

#### 4. Security Violation

**Expected**: Blocked immediately

- Hardcoded secrets detected
- Gitleaks findings
- Policy violations
- Manual intervention required

#### 5. Failing Tests

**Expected**: Blocked until fixed

- Unit test failures
- Build errors
- Quality gate failures
- Auto-fix attempts if enabled

## âš¡ Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Override

When critical hotfixes need to bypass normal gates:

```bash
# Enable emergency mode
.github/scripts/safety-circuit.js emergency-on "P0 production outage"

# Apply emergency label to PR
gh pr edit PR_NUMBER --add-label emergency-hotfix

# Trigger Release Captain with override
/merge-pr PR_NUMBER --emergency
```

### Circuit Breaker Management

```bash
# Check circuit status
.github/scripts/safety-circuit.js status

# Reset circuit after incident resolution
.github/scripts/safety-circuit.js reset

# Manual failure recording (for testing)
.github/scripts/safety-circuit.js record-failure
```

### Auto-Rollback Procedures

If automatic rollback is triggered:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Check #incidents channel for auto-generated issue
   - Verify rollback completion in deployment logs
   - Confirm service health metrics

2. **Investigation**
   - Review rollback trigger cause
   - Analyze deployment metrics
   - Check error logs and traces

3. **Resolution**
   - Fix root cause in separate PR
   - Test thoroughly in staging
   - Plan forward deployment

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Release Captain Not Triggering

```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=release-captain.yml

# Verify trigger conditions
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json author,draft,mergeable

# Check authorization
gh api /repos/OWNER/REPO/collaborators/USERNAME/permission
```

#### Quality Gates Failing

```bash
# Check specific gate logs
gh run view RUN_ID --log

# Validate local environment
pnpm run build
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test

# Fix common issues
pnpm run lint --fix
pnpm run format
```

#### OPA Policy Evaluation Errors

```bash
# Test policy locally
opa eval -d .github/policies -i test-input.json "data.summit.release.decision"

# Validate policy syntax
opa fmt .github/policies/release.rego

# Debug policy logic
opa test .github/policies/ -v
```

#### Safety Circuit Issues

```bash
# Check circuit state
.github/scripts/safety-circuit.js status

# Review recent deployments
jq '.rateLimit.recentDeployments' /tmp/safety-circuit-state.json

# Manual reset if needed
.github/scripts/safety-circuit.js reset
```

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Release Captain Performance**
   - Workflow execution time
   - Success/failure rate
   - Quality gate pass rate
   - Auto-fix success rate

2. **Deployment Safety**
   - Circuit breaker state
   - Rollback frequency
   - Time to detection (TTD)
   - Time to recovery (TTR)

3. **Security Posture**
   - Secret detection rate
   - Vulnerability blocking
   - Policy violation trends
   - SARIF finding patterns

#### Dashboard Queries

```bash
# Release Captain workflow metrics
gh api /repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/release-captain.yml/runs \
  --jq '.workflow_runs[] | {conclusion, created_at, run_number}'

# Safety circuit health
.github/scripts/safety-circuit.js status | jq .

# Recent security findings
gh api /repos/OWNER/REPO/code-scanning/alerts \
  --jq '.[] | {rule, state, created_at}'
```
