# ADR-0051: Adaptive Quantum Excellence Architecture

**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Approved
**Version**: v0.4.5

## Context

Building upon the success of v0.4.4 Quantum Application Mesh (QAM), we need to implement **adaptive quantum excellence** that goes beyond static optimization to provide **tri-objective optimization** (performance, cost, security) and **self-adaptive quantum applications** that continuously improve through machine learning and real-world feedback.

### Current State
- v0.4.4 QAM provides static quantum templates with fixed optimization strategies
- Manual parameter tuning requires expert knowledge and significant time investment
- Resource allocation is reactive rather than predictive
- Optimization decisions are single-objective (typically performance-focused)
- Limited learning from execution history and performance patterns

### Business Requirements
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Balance performance, cost, and security simultaneously
- **Adaptive intelligence**: Applications that learn and improve from execution feedback
- **Predictive optimization**: Proactive resource allocation and workload scheduling
- **Automated tuning**: Reduce manual intervention by 40%+ through intelligent automation
- **Cost efficiency**: 20%+ reduction in quantum compute costs through optimization

## Decision

We will implement **MC Platform v0.4.5 "Adaptive Quantum Excellence"** with four core components:

### 1. Tri-Objective Optimizer
Multi-dimensional optimization engine that simultaneously balances:
- **Performance**: Execution time, fidelity, throughput
- **Cost**: Quantum backend costs, classical compute overhead, total cost of ownership
- **Security**: Cryptographic strength, privacy preservation, compliance adherence

### 2. Adaptive Quantum Applications
Self-improving quantum applications with:
- **Parameter adaptation**: Circuit parameters self-tune based on execution results
- **Backend selection**: Intelligent backend choice based on performance history
- **Error mitigation**: Dynamic error mitigation strategy selection
- **Resource learning**: Learning-based resource allocation optimization

### 3. Quantum Intelligence Engine
Advanced AI/ML for quantum workload optimization:
- **Performance prediction**: ML models for execution time and fidelity forecasting
- **Anomaly detection**: Pattern recognition for quantum execution anomalies
- **Workload scheduling**: Intelligent scheduling with workload affinity analysis
- **Hardware optimization**: Predictive maintenance and hardware health monitoring

### 4. Dynamic Resource Allocation
Real-time resource management:
- **Predictive scaling**: Proactive resource allocation based on workload predictions
- **Multi-tenant fairness**: SLA-aware resource distribution across tenants
- **Cost optimization**: Budget-aware resource allocation with cost minimization
- **Real-time reallocation**: <5s response time for priority-based resource changes
