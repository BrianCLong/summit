# Routing Taxonomy

Use one or more categories:

- CI/CD & Checks
- Security & Supply Chain
- Release & GA
- Repo Architecture & Refactors
- Agent Ops
- Docs & Comms

Notes:
- Choose the smallest set that fully covers the request.
- If the request spans multiple categories, note the coupling explicitly.
