# === Lawful Basis ===
lawful_basis:
  primary: legitimate_interest
  description: "Processing publicly available vulnerability data for security and threat intelligence purposes"
  documentation: "CISA KEV catalog is public domain US Government data, freely available for security research and protection"
  consent_required: false
  data_subject_rights: n/a  # No personal data

# === Purpose & Use ===
purpose:
  primary: "Ingest known exploited vulnerabilities for security monitoring and threat intelligence"
  secondary:
    - "Enable vulnerability risk assessment"
    - "Support incident response prioritization"
    - "Track ransomware-associated vulnerabilities"
  data_minimization: "Only collect vulnerability metadata, no personal data"
  retention_justification: "Retain for historical analysis and trend identification"

# === Risk Analysis ===
risk_analysis:
  - risk: unauthorized_disclosure
    likelihood: very_low
    impact: low
    rationale: "Data is already public domain"
    mitigation: "Standard access controls"

  - risk: data_manipulation
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    rationale: "Modified vulnerability data could mislead security teams"
    mitigation: "Data integrity checks, source verification, immutable audit logs"

  - risk: availability_loss
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    rationale: "Inability to ingest vulnerability data reduces threat awareness"
    mitigation: "Caching, retry logic, fallback sources"

  - risk: excessive_collection
    likelihood: very_low
    impact: very_low
    rationale: "Only collecting public vulnerability metadata"
    mitigation: "Minimal data collection per spec"

# === Mitigations ===
mitigations:
  - "Data source is US Government public domain (no license restrictions)"
  - "No PII collection or processing"
  - "Data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)"
  - "Data encrypted at rest (AES-256)"
  - "Access restricted to authorized personnel via RBAC"
  - "Audit logging enabled for all ingestion operations"
  - "Data integrity validation via checksums"
  - "Source verification (official CISA domain)"
  - "Immutable audit trail"

# === Security Controls ===
security_controls:
  encryption_in_transit: true
  encryption_at_rest: true
  access_control: rbac
  audit_logging: true
  data_validation: true
  source_verification: true
  anomaly_detection: true

# === Retention & Deletion ===
retention:
  default_days: 365
  justification: "Retain for historical vulnerability trend analysis"
  legal_hold_supported: false  # No legal hold needed for public data
  deletion_method: secure_wipe
  backup_retention_days: 90
  anonymization_required: false  # No personal data

# === Notes ===
notes: |
  CISA KEV catalog is US Government public domain data. No personal information
  is collected. Primary risk is data integrity - ensuring vulnerability data
  is not manipulated. Standard security controls are sufficient.

  Review quarterly or when connector is significantly modified.
