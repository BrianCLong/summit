id: intent-spec-pr1
problem_statement: >-
  Intent requirements are not enforced consistently for AI-assisted changes, which
  weakens governance gates and review clarity.
user_impact: >-
  Reviewers and release owners get a deterministic intent artifact that describes
  scope, risks, invariants, and acceptance tests.
non_goals:
  - Implement provenance ledger capture or evidence bundling in this PR.
  - Change release gates beyond intent validation.
constraints:
  - category: security
    detail: Do not emit secrets or sensitive data in validation output.
  - category: performance
    detail: Validation must complete in under one second for typical PRs.
invariants:
  - Intent specs remain machine-validated against a canonical schema.
  - Sensitive changes must declare at least one automated acceptance test.
acceptance_tests:
  - id: intent-cli
    description: Validate intent specs with the summit-intent CLI.
    type: automated
    command: node scripts/intent/summit-intent.mjs validate
    evidence: scripts/intent/__tests__/intent-validator.test.mjs
  - id: intent-ci
    description: CI job enforces intent spec on AI-tagged or sensitive PRs.
    type: manual
risk_level:
  level: medium
  rationale: Introduces new governance gate and schema validation.
