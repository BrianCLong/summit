# Georgia Disinformation Space: Unfair Advantage Plan (Summit / IntelGraph / Maestro Conductor)

## A) The Unfair Wedge (GA-specific)

1. **Positioning (GA)**: "Summit delivers evidence-grade disinformation response for Georgia agencies and enterprises with provenance-first AI that is policy-gated, deployable in state networks, and defensible in audits."
2. **Category Creation**: Evidence-Grade Disinformation Operations System for Georgia.
3. **Differentiators**:
   - **Provable chain-of-custody** for every GA incident: immutable provenance ledger, analyst notes, and explainability exports aligned to GA Open Records/Audit expectations.
   - **Policy-gated AI at ingestion and action**: ABAC/OPA controls, DLP/redaction, and privacy modes that enforce Georgia state data-handling rules before any model call or export.
   - **Deploy-anywhere with interoperable reporting**: cloud/on-prem/air-gapped footprints with STIX/TAXII and legal-ready reports tailored for GA fusion centers, election task forces, and regulated enterprises.

## C) Offer Design (land → expand)

### Land Offer: **Provenance Disinfo Ops Cell – GA Edition (6–10 weeks)**

- **Data Sources**: STIX/TAXII feeds, curated OSINT, agency incident logs, public media, documents, and media uploads. Optional: enterprise logs (with ABAC/OPA gating) and redacted case files.
- **Workflows**: Detect narrative clusters → provenance capture → analyst validation with explainability → policy-gated AI summarization → export legal-ready bundle.
- **Governance**: ABAC/OPA rules tuned to GA privacy, CJIS-adjacent handling for law enforcement, DLP/redaction defaults; multi-tenant segregation for state vs. county vs. enterprise tenants.
- **Deliverables**: Weekly incident dossiers with evidence chains, policy-evaluation records, automation runbooks, and executive scorecards.

## D) “Better Together” Partner Play (GA reality)

- **Primes/SIs**: Accenture Federal (Atlanta), Deloitte, Booz Allen (Augusta/Atlanta), Leidos (Fort Gordon proximity), SAIC – bring contract vehicles and delivery scale; Summit provides provenance-grade platform. Joint pitch: evidence-grade disinfo cell with policy-gated AI. First deal hypothesis: GEMA/HS or GTA resilience pilot via prime task order.

- **Mechanics**: Referral fees or co-sell, joint tabletop collateral, shared SBOM/audit bundle, rapid enablement via Maestro Conductor automation templates.

## E) How We Win Procurement (fast lanes)

- **Paths**: GTA statewide contracts; cooperative purchasing (NASPO ValuePoint via GA participation); university purchasing (USG vendor); pilot MOUs for innovation funds; teaming through primes for federal/Guard adjacency; enterprise MSAs with crisis firms.
- **Decision Tree**:
  - **State/Local**: If GTA-managed → piggyback on statewide IT contract or NASPO; else county/city → pilot MOU → convert to subscription via emergency procurement after tabletop.
  - **Enterprise**: If regulated (energy/finance/aviation) → start with risk/comms budget + crisis retainer partner; if HQ approval needed → provide SBOM/DLP/OPA packet and SOC mappings to accelerate security review.
  - **University/NGO**: If research-funded → use grant/center funds with academic partnership MOU; if operational → small-seat pilot via procurement card limits, then scale through USG vendor onboarding.

## F) Proof + Defensibility (why we’re safe to buy)

- **Evidence Bundle**: SBOM + SLSA provenance summary; immutable audit logs with sample redacted entries; data-handling and retention matrix; DLP/redaction defaults; ABAC/OPA policy pack (Georgia privacy & CJIS-adjacent controls); responsible-use policy; model governance with eval matrix (bias, hallucination guardrails); exportable reporting templates (legal/executive) showing evidence chain and reviewer approvals.
