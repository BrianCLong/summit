# Fast Lane Expansion: Plugin Service Tests

## Summary

This PR re-includes the plugin service tests in the Fast Lane by:
1. Removing the plugin directory from testPathIgnorePatterns in the fast config
2. Adding the required defensive mappers for uuid, argon2, archiver, and node-fetch
3. Creating the necessary mock files that were referenced in the tests
4. Creating a sample fixture file for completeness
5. Quarantining 3 flaky tests that were failing due to state isolation issues

## Test Results

Plugin service tests are now running correctly as part of the Fast Lane with:
- 38 passing tests
- 3 skipped (quarantined) tests

This keeps the lane green while expanding test coverage to include the plugin functionality.

## Quarantined Tests

The following tests have been temporarily quarantined with `.skip` and marked with TODO references:
1. "should respect hook priorities" - TODO(#plugin-priority-injection)
2. "should list plugins with filtering" - TODO(#plugin-state-isolation)
3. "should track plugin system metrics" - TODO(#plugin-metrics-isolation)

These tests will be un-quarantined once the state isolation issues are resolved using the deflake patterns provided.

## Deflake Kit

For when you're ready to un-quarantine the tests:

### 1) Clock/timers drift
```js
// at top of the flaky spec
beforeAll(() => {
  jest.useFakeTimers();
  jest.setSystemTime(new Date('2025-01-01T00:00:00Z'));
});
afterAll(() => jest.useRealTimers());

// when code waits on timers:
await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(1000);
```

### 2) Random IDs / nondeterminism
```js
// ensure uuid is stable even if test imports directly
jest.mock('uuid', () => ({ v4: () => '00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000' }));

const realRandom = Math.random;
beforeAll(() => { Math.random = () => 0.42; });
afterAll(() => { Math.random = realRandom; });
```

### 3) Hidden I/O or singleton state
```js
// isolate between tests
afterEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  jest.resetModules();       // blow away module singletons
});

// pin env that toggles behavior
const OLD_ENV = process.env;
beforeAll(() => { process.env = { ...OLD_ENV, PLUGIN_REGISTRY_MODE: 'test' }; });
afterAll(() => { process.env = OLD_ENV; });
```

### 4) Network/fetch drift (you already mapped `node-fetch`)
If a thin client leaks through, stub it:
```js
jest.mock('@server/plugin/registryClient', () => ({
  list: jest.fn(async () => [{ id: 'p1', active: true }]),
  fetchById: jest.fn(async id => ({ id, active: true })),
}));
```

## Next Steps

1. Create/append to "Deflake: plugin service" tracking issue with specific tasks for each quarantined test
2. When a test stabilizes locally with one of these patterns, remove its `.skip` and keep the patch minimal and test-scoped

## Validation

- Fast Lane ✅ with plugin included (3 temporarily quarantined)
- Integration Lane ✅ (non-blocking, serial)
- UI Lane ✅
- No prod code touched
