# Repo Assumptions & Reality Check

**Topic:** Agentic Policy Implementation ("On Programming with Agents")
**Date:** 2026-05-21

## 1. Verified Facts
*   **Repo Structure:** `docs/` exists. `scripts/` exists and uses Node/TS.
*   **Runtime:** `node` (v18+), `pnpm` (v10), `tsx`.
*   **Testing:** `jest` is configured in root. `scripts/` are included in `jest` roots.
*   **CI:** GitHub Actions used extensively (`.github/workflows/`).
*   **Governance:** Existing "Governance Engine" and "Evidence ID" checks suggest a mature compliance environment.

## 2. Assumptions
*   **Adoption:** The team accepts `PLAN.md` as a file in the repo root for PRs.
*   **Labeling:** PRs generated by agents will be labeled or identified somehow (config allows identifying by label).
*   **Permissions:** The `agentic-plan-gate` workflow will have read access to the repo contents.

## 3. Constraints (Self-Imposed)
*   **No breaking changes:** Existing gates are untouched.
*   **Performance:** The new gate must be fast (<30s).
*   **Determinism:** Artifacts are deterministic (no timestamps in hashes).
