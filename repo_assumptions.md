# Repo Assumptions & Validation

## Structure Validation

| Plan Path | Actual Path | Status | Notes |
|Str|Str|Str|Str|
| `summit/` | `summit/` | ✅ Exists | Root directory containing features and core logic. |
| `intelgraph/` | `intelgraph/` | ✅ Exists | Root directory. Python package (has `__init__.py`) and sub-services. |
| `agents/` | `agents/` | ✅ Exists | Root directory. Contains agent definitions (e.g., `osint`, `psyops`). |
| `pipelines/` | `pipelines/` | ✅ Exists | Root directory. |
| `docs/` | `docs/` | ✅ Exists | Root directory. |
| `scripts/` | `scripts/` | ✅ Exists | Root directory. |
| `tests/` | `tests/` | ✅ Exists | Root directory. |
| `.github/workflows/` | `.github/workflows/` | ✅ Exists | Root directory. |

## Component Mapping

| Planned Component | Proposed Location | Actual Location / Action |
|Str|Str|Str|
| Streaming Narrative Graph Core | `intelgraph/streaming/` | Create `intelgraph/streaming/` (New Python subpackage). |
| Maestro Agent Conductor | `agents/maestro/` | `maestro/` (Root dir) exists. Will use `maestro/conductor.py`. |
| Narrative Strength Index | `metrics/ns_index.json` | `metrics/` exists. Logic likely in `intelgraph/streaming/analytics.py`. |
| Evidence Bundle | `evidence/` | `evidence/` exists. Will follow existing schema/patterns. |

## Constraints & Checks

* **Graph Storage**: `intelgraph/services/ingest` and `intelgraph/graph_analytics` suggest existing graph infrastructure.
* **Agent Runtime**: `maestro/app.py` suggests Python. `agents/` seem to be config/definitions? Or logic too? (Checked `agents/osint`, it's a dir, likely logic).
* **CI Gates**: `AGENTS.md` lists `make smoke`, `pnpm test`.
* **Evidence Policy**: `docs/governance/EVIDENCE_ID_POLICY.yml` (from memory) and `evidence/schemas/` (from memory) should be respected.

## Next Steps

1. Implement **PR-1: Streaming Narrative Graph Core** in `intelgraph/streaming/`.
2. Implement **PR-4: Maestro Agent Conductor** in `maestro/` (adapting from plan's `agents/maestro/`).

## Bombadil UI Fuzz Probe (planned work)
### Verified
- **Repo already contains `repo_assumptions.md`** that must be updated for new initiatives.
- **Root-level docs hierarchy** includes `docs/security/`, `docs/ops/`, `docs/standards/` (targets for new docs).

### Assumed (must validate before coding)
- **UI entrypoint**: The Summit UI can be launched locally for smoke probes.
- **Existing CI artifact upload patterns** exist to follow for `artifacts/` uploads.
- **Browser automation**: Playwright browsers are available in CI runtime.

### Must-not-touch for UI fuzz PR1 (doc-only)
- `docs/ci/REQUIRED_CHECKS_POLICY.yml`
- `.github/workflows/*`
- `SECURITY/` (any file)
