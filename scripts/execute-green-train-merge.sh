# Conflict Resolution Report for PR Bundle $bundle_num

## Overview
This report documents the conflicts that would need to be resolved when merging PR Bundle $bundle_num.

## Conflicting Files
\`\`\`
$(git diff --name-only HEAD "$bundle" | head -20)
\`\`\`

## Resolution Strategy
1. Manually review each conflicting file
2. Resolve conflicts by integrating changes appropriately
3. Test the integrated functionality
4. Commit the resolved merge

## Recommendation
For complex merges with unrelated histories, consider using a more targeted approach:
- Identify key features in the PR bundle
- Implement those features incrementally in the main codebase
- Validate each incremental change with tests
