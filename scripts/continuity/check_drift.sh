# In a future iteration, this script will programmatically check:
# 1. Structural Drift: Are core directory structures intact?
# 2. Naming Drift: Are naming conventions (kebab-case, PascalCase) being followed?
# 3. Identity Drift: Do key files (README.md, AGENTS.md) still align with the Prime Directive?
# 4. Agent Role Drift: Are defined agents operating within their distinct scopes?
