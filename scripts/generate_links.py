# reads CSVs, resolves UIDs to issue URLs via gh, writes back columns `issue_number`,`url`

# This script is a placeholder. Its implementation would involve:
# 1. Reading a CSV file.
# 2. For each row, extracting a UID.
# 3. Using the GitHub CLI (gh) or GraphQL API to find the corresponding GitHub Issue
#    based on the UID (e.g., by searching issue body for "UID: <uid>").
# 4. Extracting the issue number and URL.
# 5. Writing these back to new columns in the CSV or a new output CSV.
