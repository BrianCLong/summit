## 🧠 Multi-Expert Orchestra is Live!

We're excited to announce the production release of **Conductor**, IntelGraph's intelligent Multi-Expert Router (MoE) with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

### 🎯 What's New

#### Intelligent Task Routing
- **7 Expert Types**: LLM_LIGHT, LLM_HEAVY, GRAPH_TOOL, RAG_TOOL, FILES_TOOL, OSINT_TOOL, EXPORT_TOOL
- **Confidence Scoring**: Get transparency into routing decisions
- **Feature Extraction**: Automatic task complexity and requirement analysis
- **Fallback Routing**: Graceful degradation when primary experts fail

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP) 
- **GraphOps Server**: Execute Cypher queries, graph algorithms, and schema operations
- **Files Server**: Secure file operations with scope-based permissions
- **Tool Registry**: Discover and manage available MCP tools
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time status of all MCP servers

#### Conductor Studio UI
- **Routing Preview**: See how tasks will be routed before execution
- **Live Execution**: Watch tasks execute with real-time logs and metrics
- **Tool Discovery**: Browse available MCP tools and capabilities
- **Evidence Downloads**: Export execution results and audit trails

#### Production Observability
- **OpenTelemetry Tracing**: Full request tracing from UI to expert execution
- **Prometheus Metrics**: 15+ metrics for routing, execution, cost, and health
- **Health Endpoints**: Detailed system health with degradation detection
- **Alert Templates**: Pre-configured alerts with trace links

### 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Start the full Conductor system
just conductor-up

# Run smoke tests to verify everything works  
just conductor-smoke

# Open the Conductor Studio
just studio-open

# Check system health
just conductor-status
```

### 📊 Key Metrics

The Conductor system exposes comprehensive metrics:

- `conductor_router_decisions_total` - Routing decisions by expert and confidence
- `conductor_expert_latency_seconds` - Expert execution time distributions  
- `conductor_expert_cost_usd` - Cost tracking for LLM operations
- `conductor_mcp_operations_total` - MCP tool usage statistics
- `conductor_active_tasks` - Current system load
- `conductor_system_health_status` - Overall system health

### 🔧 Architecture

Built on production-grade foundations:

- **Docker Compose**: Full service orchestration with health checks
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating when components fail
- **Security First**: Authentication, rate limiting, and scope validation
- **Horizontal Scale**: Ready for multi-instance deployment
