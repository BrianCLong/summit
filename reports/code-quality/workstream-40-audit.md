# Workstream 40 Code Quality Audit

## Overview
- **Date:** 2025-09-26
- **Scope:** Node/TypeScript server workspace, Python data-quality service, SonarQube readiness.
- **Artifacts:** `scripts/run_code_quality_audit.sh` (automation entry point), logs under `reports/code-quality/logs/`, and this report.

## Tooling Execution Summary
| Tool | Command | Exit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ESLint | `pnpm exec eslint server --ext .ts,.tsx` | 1 | Reports 7,843 issues across server code; major categories include `@ts-ignore` usage, empty blocks, unused vars, and forbidden CommonJS imports. | 
| Pylint | `pylint services/data-quality/src` | 0 | Clean after refactors; rating 10/10. |
| SonarQube | `sonar-scanner` | 127 | Scanner not installed in environment; placeholder log generated. |

Execution transcript: see `reports/code-quality/logs/*.log` (produced by the automation script).【F:scripts/run_code_quality_audit.sh†L1-L47】【fefa5c†L1-L14】

## ESLint Findings (Server)
- **High volume of lint debt:** 7,843 total problems (2,473 errors). Key errors include banned `@ts-ignore` comments, empty block statements, `no-unused-vars`, and raw `console` usage in tests and utilities.【e9b3a0†L1-L120】
- **Outdated configuration:** ESLint warns that `.eslintignore` should be migrated to the `ignores` property in `eslint.config.js`, indicating the config is not aligned with the flat config migration guidance.【ab5f30†L1-L3】
- **React plugin warning:** Missing `settings.react.version` triggers configuration noise and may hide version-specific checks.【4e4a93†L1-L2】
- **Recommended actions:**
  - Prioritize cleanup of unused variables in cluster, AI tests, and tracing modules to restore CI lint gating.
  - Replace legacy CommonJS `require` imports in tests with ES module syntax or configure exceptions for Node-specific setup files.
  - Audit `@ts-ignore` usage and convert to `@ts-expect-error` with comments, as flagged by rule `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`.
  - Enforce explicit React version in ESLint config to match `react@19.x` and avoid misaligned linting.

## Pylint Findings (Data Quality Service)
- **Initial issues:** Absolute imports (`from models import ...`) broke module resolution and numerous docstrings were missing, producing import errors and style warnings.【3b4b17†L1-L24】
- **Fixes applied:**
  - Switched to package-relative imports and added module/function docstrings across the FastAPI entrypoint, rule engine, and models.【F:services/data-quality/src/main.py†L1-L74】【F:services/data-quality/src/rule_engine.py†L1-L40】【F:services/data-quality/src/models.py†L1-L59】
  - Improved rule validation helper to satisfy lint rules while maintaining Pydantic behavior.【F:services/data-quality/src/models.py†L20-L27】
- **Result:** Pylint now reports a 10.00/10 score for the service, eliminating import errors and style violations.【280596†L1-L4】【fefa5c†L5-L9】

## Package Management Hygiene
- **Workspace install blocker removed:** `apps/intelgraph-api/package.json` contained leading spaces before scoped package names, causing `pnpm install` to fail. Normalized the package name and dev dependency keys to restore workspace install flow.【F:apps/intelgraph-api/package.json†L2-L33】

## SonarQube Readiness
- The automation script checks for `sonar-scanner` and logs a reminder when absent; no scan was executed in this environment. Recommend integrating SonarQube or an alternative SAST step (e.g., GitHub Advanced Security) in CI to complement linting coverage.【F:scripts/run_code_quality_audit.sh†L30-L43】【fefa5c†L7-L13】

## Recommendations
1. **Stabilize linting pipeline:** Address the highest-volume ESLint errors (unused variables, empty blocks, banned comments) and enable linting in CI to fail builds on regressions.
2. **Update ESLint configuration:** Migrate ignore patterns to the new flat config format and set the React version explicitly to remove warnings.【ab5f30†L1-L3】【4e4a93†L1-L2】
3. **Adopt automated quality gates:** Expand the new audit script into a CI job that uploads ESLint/Pylint reports and invokes SonarQube once the scanner is available.【F:scripts/run_code_quality_audit.sh†L1-L47】
4. **Harden Python services:** Replicate the docstring/import cleanup pattern across other Python microservices to raise maintainability and unblock future static analysis.

## Next Steps
- Track remediation tasks in the backlog (group ESLint issues by module owner).
- Consider introducing stricter TypeScript configs (`noImplicitAny`) after addressing the current lint debt.
- Evaluate migrating FastAPI service storage from in-memory dictionaries to persistent stores and add unit tests to cover quarantine workflows.
