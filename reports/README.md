# Reports

This directory contains generated reports.

## Copilot Adoption

The `copilot/` subdirectory contains weekly reports on GitHub Copilot usage and adoption, generated by the `.github/workflows/copilot-adoption-report.yml` workflow.

These reports provide insights into:
- Active users
- Chat requests
- Suggestion acceptance rates
- Top contributors

### Slack Integration

The workflow can optionally post these reports to Slack. To enable this, configure the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret in the repository settings.
