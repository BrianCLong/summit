# Workstream 31 Accessibility Audit

## Scope
- Dashboard overview, live activity feed, latency/error panels, and observability links.
- Golden Path onboarding wizard (ingest flow proxy).
- Graph visualization workspace (Cytoscape-based canvas).

## Changes Implemented
- Added semantic landmarks, headings, and ARIA labelling across dashboard cards.
- Converted stats list to a keyboard-focusable description list and improved color contrast.
- Enhanced live activity feed with keyboard controls, announcements, and high-contrast chips.
- Wrapped latency/error panels in labelled sections with accessible chart summaries and datagrid labelling.
- Hardened Grafana/Jaeger links with descriptive aria attributes and consistent high-contrast buttons.
- Reworked Golden Path wizard dialog with labelled steps, live progress, and accessible controls.
- Introduced keyboard navigation, focus management, and status announcements to the graph canvas; adjusted edge/node styling for contrast.

## Automated Testing
- Jest + jest-axe unit checks for StatsOverview and GoldenPathWizard.
- Playwright axe scans covering `/`, `/dashboard`, and `/graph` routes (tests updated to run against new semantics).

## Manual Verification Notes
- Keyboard traversal confirmed for live activity feed and graph canvas using arrow keys and Enter/Escape.
- Screen-reader spot checks (NVDA) recommended on physical hardware to validate Cytoscape announcements under assistive tech.

## Follow-up Recommendations
- Restore real data bindings for StatsOverview to surface live metrics once backend schema stabilises.
- Consider dedicated E2E coverage for ingest wizard once linked into routing flow.
- Monitor graph canvas performance impact from additional focus handling during large node counts.
