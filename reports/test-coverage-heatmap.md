# Test Coverage Heatmap

Generated: 2025-12-03T07:51:35.785Z

The heatmap highlights services with coverage gaps based on Istanbul coverage outputs found in the repository.

Service | Statements | Branches | Functions | Heat
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
server | 69.1% (2735/3960) | 56.5% (1091/1931) | 63.4% (571/901) | 🟠 Risk

## Prioritized Coverage Gaps
1. **server** — server/src/services/AdvancedAnalyticsService.js · 48.1% statements (310 uncovered), branches 98/260, functions 59/113
2. **server** — server/src/services/ReportingService.js · 39.8% statements (271 uncovered), branches 88/209, functions 41/117
3. **server** — server/src/services/NotificationService.js · 36.8% statements (223 uncovered), branches 39/170, functions 22/82
4. **server** — server/src/services/PluginService.js · 71.1% statements (114 uncovered), branches 116/180, functions 42/79
5. **server** — server/src/services/EnterpriseSecurityService.js · 74.9% statements (88 uncovered), branches 116/183, functions 49/76
6. **server** — server/src/services/VisualizationService.js · 86.1% statements (70 uncovered), branches 208/336, functions 104/137
7. **server** — server/src/services/CopilotOrchestrationService.js · 82.9% statements (53 uncovered), branches 65/106, functions 50/63
8. **server** — server/src/services/IntegrationService.js · 85.7% statements (36 uncovered), branches 110/142, functions 34/50
9. **server** — server/src/services/MultimodalDataService.js · 80.8% statements (32 uncovered), branches 65/100, functions 22/27
10. **server** — server/src/services/MobileService.js · 92.5% statements (15 uncovered), branches 81/109, functions 45/50
11. **server** — server/src/services/SimulationEngineService.js · 96.6% statements (13 uncovered), branches 105/136, functions 103/107

## How to Improve
- Start with the red/orange services; they have the highest uncovered statement counts.
- Add unit tests for the functions listed in the prioritized gaps to lift statement and branch coverage.
- Re-run `npm run test:coverage` and this script to refresh the heatmap.
