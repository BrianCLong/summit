# EP01-T02 Problem Statements & Objectives

## Problem Statements

1.  **Analyst Overload**: Intelligence analysts are overwhelmed by the volume of disconnected data sources, leading to missed insights and slow reporting times.
2.  **Trust Paradox**: Decision-makers struggle to trust AI-generated insights due to a lack of transparent provenance and audit trails.
3.  **Data Silos**: Critical information is trapped in disparate systems (S3, CSVs, APIs) with no unified graph view.
4.  **Compliance Friction**: Manual compliance checks slow down deployment and data sharing, creating bottlenecks.
5.  **Cost Unpredictability**: Cloud costs for graph processing and AI inference are unpredictable and often exceed budgets.

## Objectives (SMART)

1.  **Unified Graph View**: Ingest and link 50+ data sources into a unified knowledge graph within 3 months, enabling cross-domain queries.
    *   *Metric*: Number of integrated data sources.
    *   *Target*: 50 sources.
2.  **Provenance Transparency**: Achieve 100% lineage tracking for all graph nodes and edges by Day 0, allowing users to trace any insight back to its source.
    *   *Metric*: Percentage of entities with complete lineage.
    *   *Target*: 100%.
3.  **Accelerated Insights**: Reduce the time to generate complex intelligence reports from days to hours using AI-assisted graph analysis.
    *   *Metric*: Average report generation time.
    *   *Target*: < 4 hours.
4.  **Automated Compliance**: Implement automated policy-as-code checks in CI/CD, reducing manual review time by 80%.
    *   *Metric*: Reduction in manual review hours.
    *   *Target*: 80% reduction.
5.  **Cost Control**: Maintain cloud infrastructure costs below $18k/month for production through proactive monitoring and resource optimization.
    *   *Metric*: Monthly cloud spend.
    *   *Target*: < $18k.
