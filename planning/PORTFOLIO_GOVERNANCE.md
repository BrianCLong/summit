# Portfolio Governance

## Rules of Engagement

"We win by choosing, then killing."

## 1. WIP Limits

- **Cap**: Max 3 active "Big Bets" per team.
- **Effect**: Stop starting, start finishing.

## 2. Kill Review

- **Frequency**: Monthly.
- **Agenda**: Review all active initiatives.
- **Action**: Kill initiatives that are:
  - Over budget/time by > 50%.
  - Invalidated by new evidence.
  - Lower priority than a new fire.

## 3. Trade-off Ledger

- We cannot add scope without removing scope.
- **Ledger**: "We are adding X, so we are cutting Y."

## 4. Decision Latency

- Decisions must be made within 48h of the Kill Review.
- No "Zombie" projects allowed.

## 5. Commitments Register

- Maintain a single source of truth for external commitments (Customer promises).
- Align roadmap to commitments, not wishes.

## 6. Staffing

- Move people to the highest priority work.
- Don't spread peanut butter (10% of 10 people = 0 output).
