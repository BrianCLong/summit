# Definition of Done (DoD)

For every feature, **“totally delivered”** means:

1. ✅ **Code merged** to main.
2. ✅ **Tests exist and pass** (unit + at least one integration / E2E, where applicable).
3. ✅ **Feature exposed** in UI/API/CLI (whatever user-visible surface is appropriate).
4. ✅ **Docs**: user-facing usage + internal runbook updated.
5. ✅ **Telemetry**: basic metrics + logs + feature flag wiring (if you use flags).
6. ✅ **Deployed** to target env(s) (staging + prod).
7. ✅ **Validated**: at least one real or simulated usage recorded; feedback captured.
