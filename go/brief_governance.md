# Commercial Brief: Summit Governance Platform

## Product Overview
The Summit Governance Platform is an enterprise-grade control plane for deploying Frontier Models with confidence. It solves the "black box" problem by providing deep visibility and control over how models are trained, used, and audited.

## Key Features
-   **Unified Policy Management**: Write policies once, enforce them everywhere (Data, Training, Runtime).
-   **Deep Observability**: Trace a bad response back to the specific data row or training step that caused it.
-   **Compliance-Ready**: Auto-generated audit trails and reports for regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act).
-   **Tenant Isolation**: Enforce strict boundaries between tenants in multi-tenant deployments.

## Target Markets
-   **Financial Services**: For fraud detection and customer-facing bots requiring strict compliance.
-   **Healthcare**: For PII protection and medical advice safety.
-   **Government/Defense**: For mission-critical control and auditability.

## Licensing Model
-   **Core SDK**: Per-seat license for developers.
-   **Enterprise Platform**: Usage-based pricing (per request/event) for the hosted control plane.
-   **Audit Add-on**: Flat fee for advanced compliance reporting features.
