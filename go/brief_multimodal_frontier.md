# Commercial Brief: Summit Multimodal Frontier v0.1

## Offering Summary
- **Multimodal Frontier SDK**: APIs for ingesting images/PDFs/UI screens, extracting graphs, and issuing multimodal reasoning calls with tool-native actions.
- **Document & UI Assistant**: Verticalized assistant for complex documents and UI navigation with provenance and governance controls.
- **Multimodal Agent Runtime**: Production runtime that orchestrates visual tools (OCR/table/chart/UI) with safety guardrails.

## Target Customers
- Enterprises with document-heavy workflows (legal, finance, insurance, public sector).
- SaaS platforms embedding in-app assistants that understand live screens.
- Cloud providers offering advanced multimodal LLM tiers with graph/tool support.

## Key Differentiators
- Graph-native representations enabling traceable answers and precise retrieval.
- Telemetry-driven curricula that close modality-specific gaps quickly.
- Tool-native orchestration to reduce numeric/chart/UI failures and provide audit trails.

## Packaging & Pricing Signals
- Usage-based API with per-modality surcharges (document page, image region, UI screen).
- Enterprise tier: dedicated tenancy, governance controls, and latency SLOs.
- OEM/SDK licensing for platform embedding with optional on-prem deployment.

## GTM Motions
- Co-build pilots for document QA and UI automation with design partners.
- Showcase latency and accuracy wins vs. text+OCR baselines.
- Publish benchmark deltas (graph/tool vs baseline) to support sales engineering.
