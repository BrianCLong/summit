# Commercial Brief: Summit Knowledge & RAG Platform

## Offering Overview
- **Summit Knowledge & RAG SDK**: Unified retrieval API, graph+doc+tool memory, telemetry hooks, and runtime orchestration for frontier models.
- **Managed Knowledge Platform**: Hosted ingestion, indexing, governance, and telemetry with SLAs; IntelGraph-compatible graph services.
- **Domain Packs**: Pre-built knowledge graphs, document corpora, and tuned retrieval configs for verticals (finance, health, legal, IT).

## Value Proposition
- Graph-native grounding reduces hallucinations on relational and policy-heavy queries.
- Telemetry-driven adaptation continuously improves coverage where models fail.
- Multi-tier memory supports personalization and tenant isolation with governance baked in.
- Lower quality-adjusted token cost compared to parametric-only baselines.

## Target Customers
- Enterprises seeking unified search + graph + LLM over proprietary data.
- SaaS products embedding domain-specific assistants with auditable grounding.
- Cloud and data platform vendors adding graph-RAG as a managed capability.

## Packaging & SLAs
- **SDK Only**: Self-hosted, includes schemas, orchestrator hooks, and reference deployments.
- **Managed**: Fully hosted ingestion/retrieval with governance; latency SLO tiers (P50/P95), uptime SLAs, and data residency options.
- **Domain Packs**: Add-on bundles with curated corpora/graphs, tuned scoring weights, and playbooks for ingestion/telemetry loops.

## Adoption Path
1. Start with SDK for pilot workloads (doc RAG + graph subgraphs).
2. Layer in telemetry-driven re-indexing for quality uplift.
3. Enable memory tiers and policy enforcement for production rollout.
4. Add domain packs and tool caches for personalization and automation.

## Differentiators
- Unified graph+doc+tool retrieval with knowledge traces.
- Closed-loop telemetry shaping of indexing and graph enrichment.
- Governance-first design (residency, redaction, audit) with per-tenant control planes.
- Training hooks for supervised alignment using knowledge traces.
