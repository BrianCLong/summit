# Agent Gym Dashboard

This application will serve as the visualization layer for Summit Agent Gym metrics.

It will display:
- Regression charts per model and environment.
- Looping index trends.
- Context sensitivity curves.
- Failure mode attribution.

Currently, metrics are reported via CI scripts in `scripts/ci/run_agent_gym_suite.ts`.
