## Development Process

We use a sprint-based development process to manage our work. Each sprint is two weeks long and focuses on a small set of high-priority tasks. We use GitHub project boards to track the progress of our work.

If you are a new contributor, we recommend that you start by looking at the issues in the "To Do" column of our [project boards](docs/project_management/github_project_boards/). These are tasks that have been identified as good first issues for new contributors.

Before you start working on an issue, please leave a comment on the issue to let us know that you are working on it. This will help us avoid duplicating work.

When you have finished working on an issue, please submit a pull request. In your pull request, please include a link to the issue you have been working on.
