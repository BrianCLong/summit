## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Before opening a new issue, please perform a search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Please provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, its potential benefits, and a possible implementation approach.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

- **Good first issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help wanted** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issues`.
