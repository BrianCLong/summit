# Project Charter — IntelGraph GA Core Integration Train

## Executive Summary

This project integrates all core IntelGraph platform capabilities into a unified, production-ready system that demonstrates the full AI-augmented intelligence analysis workflow from data ingestion through collaborative investigation.

## Project Justification

**Why now?** IntelGraph has reached feature completeness across individual components but lacks cohesive integration demonstrating the full platform value proposition.

- **Market Opportunity**: Intelligence analysis market demanding AI-augmented collaborative platforms
- **Technical Maturity**: Core components (graph database, AI/ML pipeline, real-time collaboration) are individually stable
- **Customer Readiness**: Pilot customers require integrated demo environment for evaluation
- **Competitive Positioning**: Need to demonstrate superior integrated workflow vs. point solutions

## Objectives & Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives

1. **Integrated Workflow**: Complete data ingestion → AI analysis → collaborative investigation → reporting pipeline operational by 2025-02-15
2. **Performance Targets**: Sub-200ms query response times, 99.5% uptime, support 100 concurrent users by 2025-02-28
3. **User Acceptance**: 90% positive feedback from 3 pilot customer demonstrations by 2025-03-15

### Success Metrics

- **Technical Performance**: Average API response time < 200ms (baseline: 450ms)
- **System Reliability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours (baseline: 97.2%)
- **User Engagement**: Average session duration > 15 minutes (baseline: 8 minutes)
- **Investigation Efficiency**: Time to complete standard investigation scenario < 30 minutes (baseline: 75 minutes)
