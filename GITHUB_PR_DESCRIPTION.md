   - Detection of Confirmation Bias, Availability Heuristic, Anchoring Bias, Hindsight Bias, Optimism Bias, Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Overconfidence Effect, Sunk Cost Fallacy, and Framing Effect
   - Confidence scoring and severity assessment for each detected bias

2. **Evidence-Based Debiasing Engine** (`intelgraph/debiasing_engine.py`)
   - 10 proven debiasing strategies grounded in cognitive science research
   - Automated application of bias mitigation techniques with effectiveness tracking
   - Bias reduction quantification and strategy optimization

3. **Metacognitive Awareness System** (`intelgraph/metacognitive_system.py`)
   - Self-reflective analysis capabilities for cognitive agents
   - Continuous awareness level improvement through experience
   - Confidence calibration and cognitive limitation recognition
   - Personalized improvement suggestions for ongoing development

4. **Integration Framework** (`intelgraph/cognitive_bias_mitigation_integration.py`)
   - Seamless integration with existing IntelGraph cognitive modeling architecture
   - Real-time bias detection and mitigation pipeline
   - Comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities
