Title: **SUMMIT — Executive Decision Packet (v1 | 2025-10-27)**

**A. Objective (1 sentence):**

> We will pivot Summit to a "Governance-First Cognitive Enterprise System" by delivering the 4 Strategic Bets (Agent Marketplace, Continuous Assurance, Cognitive Defense, Auto-Scientist) so that we secure the "Trust" competitive advantage and govern the future of intelligence.

**B. Deadline + immovable constraints:**

* Deadline: **Phase 1 Alpha Launch: 2026-04-27 (6 months)**
* Constraints: budget cap **(maintain current burn)**, security/compliance **(SOC2 Type II + ISO 27001 readiness)**, quality bar **(Zero Critical/High CVEs, 99.9% API Availability)**

**C. Critical Path (top 5):**

1. **Provenance Ledger V2 (Immutable Log)** (Eng Lead, Due: Month 2)
2. **Agent Identity System (SPIFFE/OIDC)** (Security Lead, Due: Month 3)
3. **High-Volume Ingestion Pipeline** (Data Lead, Due: Month 4)
4. **Policy Engine v1 (OPA Integration)** (Platform Lead, Due: Month 4)
5. **Alpha Release "Certified Solvers"** (Product Lead, Due: Month 5)

**D. Decisions required (max 3):**

1. Decide: **Kill "General Graph" Features?** (Option A: Maintain legacy, Option B: Deprecate to focus on Governance. **Rec: B**, Deadline: Immediate)
2. Decide: **Open Source Strategy?** (Option A: Full Open Source, Option B: Open Core (Ledger/Graph only). **Rec: B**, Deadline: Month 1)
3. Decide: **Resource Allocation?** (Move 100% of "Consumer Chatbot" resources to "Cognitive Defense"? **Rec: Yes**, Deadline: Immediate)

**E. Risks that can kill Summit (top 5):**

* Risk: **"Shadow IT" Perception** | Mitigation: **Strict Tenant Isolation & Audit Logs** | Decision deadline: Now
* Risk: **Performance at Scale (Billion Edges)** | Mitigation: **Distributed PageRank Optimization** | Decision deadline: Month 3
* Risk: **Regulatory Non-Compliance** | Mitigation: **Continuous Assurance (Bet 2)** | Decision deadline: Ongoing
* Risk: **Market Confusion (vs Palantir/ServiceNow)** | Mitigation: **Clear "Governance-First" Messaging** | Decision deadline: Now
* Risk: **Burn Rate** | Mitigation: **Focus on 4 Bets, cut non-essential R&D** | Decision deadline: Monthly

**F. Asks (what you need from execs):**

* Headcount: **4 Specialized Hires (Security, Distributed Systems)**
* Budget: **Infrastructure cost for "High-Volume Ingestion" pilot**
* Authority: **Approval to deprecate non-governance roadmap items**
