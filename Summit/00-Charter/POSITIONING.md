## One-slide positioning (copy/paste)

**Title:** Summit CompanyOS + Switchboard — *Trustworthy Automation for Regulated, Multi-System Operations*

**Category:** Policy-bound automation + provenance ledger + operator portal (IDP + workflow + governance)

**The wedge (why we win):**

* **Every action is policy-checked, explainable, and exportable as evidence**
* **Receipts are first-party** (from execution), not screenshots and log archaeology
* **Multi-tenant from day 0** with per-tenant isolation + metering + unit economics

**What we replace vs. what we complement:**

* Complement: ServiceNow / Backstage / Temporal / Vanta / AI search tools
* Replace: “glue scripts + tribal knowledge + post-hoc compliance scrambling”

**Proof points (demo bullets):**

1. ABAC preflight → approval → action run → **signed receipt export**
2. Workflow “Runs UI” with retries/compensation + **policy trace**
3. “Why access?” + lineage → **auditor-ready evidence bundle**
4. Per-tenant cost drill-down → **cost attribution receipts**

**Who buys / first wedge buyer:**

* Security/Platform/GRC leaders who want automation + AI **but can’t accept black boxes**

**CTA:** “Pick 5 critical tools + 2 high-risk actions. We’ll prove policy + receipts end-to-end in 2 weeks.”
