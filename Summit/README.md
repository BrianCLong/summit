# Summit Command Center

**Channel:** `#summit-command` (or equivalent)

Everything goes in the `#summit-command` channel.

## Summit Rules of Engagement (ROE) v1

1. **Single Source of Truth:** Status, decisions, and risks live in the Summit folder; no side deals.
2. **Decision Authority:** Summit Owner decides. Leads advise. Escalations resolved within 24 hours.
3. **Scope Control:** Scope freezes at M1. New requests become “Phase 2” unless Owner approves tradeoffs in writing.
4. **External Commitments:** No promises to vendors/partners/customers without written approval + contracting lane.
5. **Comms Discipline:** One spokesperson. No external statements without Comms + Counsel approval.
6. **Data & Security:** No new data collection/use until data handling is documented (what, why, where, retention).
7. **Documentation:** Every material decision is logged (date, decider, rationale, risks accepted).
8. **Incident Protocol:** If something breaks, stop, contain, document, then communicate.
