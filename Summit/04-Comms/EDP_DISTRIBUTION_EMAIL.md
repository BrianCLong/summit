Team,

Summit is now operating under a single decision chain to align with the "Governance-First" pivot.

Attached is the **Executive Decision Packet (EDP)**. It outlines our objective, critical path, and the 3 core decisions we need to unlock execution.

**[LINK TO EDP: Summit/01-Plan/EXECUTIVE_DECISION_PACKET.md]**

**Action Required:**
Please reply to this thread with either:
(a) **Approval** (Agree to all recommendations in Section D).
(b) **A single change request**.
(c) **An explicit objection with an alternative**.

**Silence by [Tomorrow 17:00 EST] = Assent.**

We are scheduling the 20-minute Exec Gate Call to confirm these decisions and unlock the requested resources.

Regards,

Summit Platform Lead
