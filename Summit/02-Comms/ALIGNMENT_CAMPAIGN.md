# Summit Alignment Campaign

This document contains the communication artifacts to "weaponize alignment" for the Summit project.

---

## 1. Stakeholder Alignment Note (Diplomatic)

**To:** exec sponsor, key stakeholders, workstream leads
**Subject:** Summit — Alignment + Next 10 Days

**Body:**

Team,

We’re executing Summit on a compressed timeline with a single decision chain.

Attached: **Summit Executive Decision Packet (EDP)** — objective, critical path, and the only decisions needed now.

Please reply by **[date/time]** with:
(a) approve,
(b) one change request, or
(c) an objection with an alternative.

We’ll run a **20-minute exec gate** at **[time]** to lock decisions and unblock execution.

*(Tone: collaborative, crisp, no threats.)*

## 2. Rules of Engagement (Enforceable)

**To:** the whole Summit team + anyone who tends to “help”
**Subject:** Summit — Rules of Engagement (Effective Immediately)

**Body:**

1.  **Single Owner:** [Name] is accountable; final decisions route there.
2.  **Scope Freeze:** scope locks at **M1**; changes require written tradeoff.
3.  **Critical Path Board:** only 10 cards; anything not on it is “later.”
4.  **Comms Control:** one spokesperson; no external commitments without approval.
5.  **Contracts:** no vendor/partner promises without the contracting lane.
6.  **Data/Security:** no new data use until data map + controls are documented.
7.  **Decision Log:** all material decisions recorded the day they’re made.
8.  **Blocked > 24h = escalation.**

*(Tone: calm authority. No debate.)*

## 3. "Kill Confusion" Calendar Rhythm

Create the following recurring invites immediately:

### A. Summit Command Sync
*   **Frequency:** Twice weekly
*   **Duration:** 30 min
*   **Purpose:** Operational sync for workstream leads.

### B. Critical Path Standup
*   **Frequency:** Daily
*   **Duration:** 7 min
*   **Purpose:** Review the 10-card Critical Path Board. Blockers only.

### C. Exec Gate
*   **Frequency:** Weekly or as needed
*   **Duration:** 20 min
*   **Purpose:** Lock decisions and unblock execution.

## 4. Phase 2 Parking Lot (Concept)

*(Note: To be established later)*
A place to capture every extra request so people feel heard—while Summit stays protected from scope creep.
