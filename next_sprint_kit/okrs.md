# OKRs — Next Sprint

## Objective 1: Ship policy-aware NL→Cypher preview with explainability
- KR1: Achieve ≥95% precision on curated NL→Cypher fixtures with policy alignment.
- KR2: Keep preview median latency under 400 ms at P95 < 850 ms using seeded demo data.
- KR3: Deliver explainability blocks with policy IDs on 100% of preview responses.

## Objective 2: Operationalize provenance-first lifecycle and demo exports
- KR1: Record ≥95% of mutating events in the provenance ledger with valid hash chains.
- KR2: Produce a signed export bundle for R2/R3 demos that passes verification script on first attempt.
- KR3: Provide R2 and R3 KPIs (throughput, replay success, verification results) in runbooks and demo notes.

## Objective 3: Control spend while surfacing SLOs and $/insight
- KR1: Launch Grafana dashboards with latency/availability/error-budget panels and downloadable JSON hooks.
- KR2: Detect and block ≥80% of adversarial cost spikes during chaos drills; alert within 5 minutes for >90% of real excursions.
- KR3: Report $/insight metric in dashboard and FinOps notes with <5% variance against offline calculation.
