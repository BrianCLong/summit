# Cognitive Bias Mitigation System for IntelGraph

## Overview
This document describes the Cognitive Bias Mitigation System, a comprehensive enhancement to the IntelGraph cognitive modeling system that adds advanced capabilities for detecting, mitigating, and managing cognitive biases in artificial cognitive agents.

## System Components

### 1. Cognitive Bias Detector (`cognitive_bias_detector.py`)
The bias detector implements algorithms to identify 10 common cognitive biases in decision-making processes:

- **Confirmation Bias**: Tendency to seek information that confirms existing beliefs
- **Availability Heuristic**: Relying on memorable or recent examples
- **Anchoring Bias**: Undue influence of initial values or estimates
- **Hindsight Bias**: Believing outcomes were predictable after they occurred
- **Optimism Bias**: Overestimating positive outcomes and underestimating negative ones
- **Loss Aversion**: Disutility of losses greater than utility of equivalent gains
- **Status Quo Bias**: Preference for current situations and resistance to change
- **Overconfidence Effect**: Overestimating abilities, knowledge, or success likelihood
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Continuing losing courses due to invested resources
- **Framing Effect**: Different decisions based on how information is presented

Each bias detection algorithm analyzes decision contexts and agent states to identify potential biases with confidence scores and severity assessments.

### 2. Debiasing Engine (`debiasing_engine.py`)
The debiasing engine implements 10 evidence-based strategies to reduce cognitive biases:

- **Actively Seek Disconfirming Evidence**: Systematically search for contradictory information
- **Use Base Rate Statistics**: Apply statistical data rather than memorable examples
- **Anchor and Adjust**: Consider alternative anchors and adjust more substantially
- **Pre-Mortem Analysis**: Imagine failure scenarios and plan contingencies
- **Consider Opportunity Cost**: Evaluate what's given up by choosing an option
- **Red Teaming**: Have third parties critically review decisions
- **Reference Class Forecasting**: Use base rates from similar situations
- **Taking the Outside View**: Look at situations from an outsider's perspective
- **Probability Tracking**: Log confidence levels and track prediction accuracy
- **Incentive Alignment**: Align incentives with desired outcomes

Each strategy is applied with tailored recommendations and effectiveness scoring.

### 3. Metacognitive System (`metacognitive_system.py`)
The metacognitive system enables agents to recognize their own cognitive limitations and biases through:

- **Self-Reflection**: Analysis of decision-making processes and outcomes
- **Awareness Updates**: Continuous improvement of bias recognition capabilities
- **Confidence Calibration**: Adjustment of confidence levels based on past accuracy
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Personalized recommendations for cognitive enhancement

### 4. Integration Module (`cognitive_bias_mitigation_integration.py`)
The integration module combines all components into a cohesive system that seamlessly integrates with the existing IntelGraph cognitive modeling architecture.
