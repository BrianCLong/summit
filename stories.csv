Summary,Description,Acceptance Criteria,Definition of Done,Labels,Epic
"GA Core: OPA ABAC enforcement","Integrate OPA policies for graph query gating with reason-for-access prompts and appeal flow.","AC1 (Policy-by-Default): All graph queries are evaluated by OPA with deny-by-default and human-readable deny reasons logged. AC2 (Provenance Integrity): Deny decisions emit immutable audit entries referencing policy version and request context. AC3 (UI Usability): Analysts can request an appeal that is routed to governance queue within 2 clicks.","OPA policy bundles deployed; unit + integration tests cover allow/deny paths; audit sink verified; demo script updated.",[ga-core;ethics;security],EPIC-GA-CORE
"Audit trail hardening","Add immutable append-only audit log across ingest, query, export with correlation IDs.","AC1 (Provenance Integrity): 100% ingest/query/export events carry correlation IDs and hash-chain anchor. AC2 (Hypothesis Rigor): Audit events include hypothesis ID when present. AC3 (ER Explainability): Audit viewer shows why an action was allowed or blocked.","Audit schema updated; OTEL exporter captures IDs; replay test validates hash chain; viewer screenshot captured.",[ga-core;ethics;ops],EPIC-GA-CORE
"Tri-pane UI with Explain-this-view","Implement graph/map/timeline panes with explainability overlay and citation callouts.","AC1 (UI Usability): Pane switch latency <250ms with keyboard shortcut. AC2 (ER Explainability): Explain overlay lists top 3 rationale paths with citations. AC3 (Hypothesis Rigor): Users can pin or reject rationale and state is persisted.","Feature flagged; VRT screenshot set; analytics event for overlay interactions; accessibility audit passed.",[ga-core;xai;experience],EPIC-GA-CORE
"Connector pack v1 (10 sources)","Ship ≥10 validated connectors with synthetic demo data and governance defaults.","AC1 (Policy-by-Default): Each connector enforces source-specific licensing guardrails. AC2 (Provenance Integrity): Connector output stamped with source and transform hash. AC3 (Ops): Connector health checks exported to Prometheus.","Connectors packaged; validation suite run; demo dataset published; docs updated with enablement steps.",[ga-core;ops;ethics],EPIC-CONNECTORS
"NL→Cypher preview sandbox","Provide NL query preview that renders Cypher, validates syntax, and executes in sandbox.","AC1 (UI Usability): Preview renders within 500ms and shows diff against prior revision. AC2 (ER Explainability): Copilot annotates each clause with source intent. AC3 (Hypothesis Rigor): Sandbox enforces dataset scope and emits hypothesis tag.","Parser metrics logged; ≥95% syntactic validity demonstrated on sample set; safety gates tested; demo recorded.",[xai;ga-core;ai],EPIC-COPILOT-XAI
"GraphRAG with path rationales","Augment copilot answers with citation paths and rationale scoring.","AC1 (ER Explainability): Responses include ≥2 path rationales with node/edge citations. AC2 (Provenance Integrity): Returned evidence references manifest IDs. AC3 (Performance): Adds <200ms median overhead vs baseline.","Evaluator notebook run; latency benchmark captured; red-team prompt-injection tests executed.",[xai;ai;ethics],EPIC-COPILOT-XAI
"Provenance manifest schema","Define manifest hash tree and transform chain for exports.","AC1 (Provenance Integrity): Manifest includes source hash, transform lineage, and export policy decision. AC2 (Policy-by-Default): Export blocked without manifest. AC3 (UI Usability): Users can download manifest bundle with one click.","Schema documented; validator implemented; CLI stub created; sample bundle attached.",[prov-ledger;ethics;security],EPIC-PROV-LEDGER
"Ledger verifier CLI beta","Create CLI to verify manifest chain, signatures, and policy compliance.","AC1 (Provenance Integrity): CLI detects tampering and outputs pass/fail with reasons. AC2 (Hypothesis Rigor): Verification logs include query hypothesis. AC3 (Ops): Exit codes compatible with CI gate.","CLI stub runnable; golden test fixtures added; README updated; CI job example added.",[prov-ledger;ops;ethics],EPIC-PROV-LEDGER
"Reason-for-access prompts","Enforce justification prompts for sensitive datasets with audit linkage.","AC1 (Policy-by-Default): Access blocked without justification text and ticket ID. AC2 (Provenance Integrity): Audit links justification to requestor and dataset. AC3 (UI Usability): Prompt supports reusable templates.","Prompt flows integrated; OPA policy updated; usability test recorded; audit dashboards updated.",[ga-core;ethics;security],EPIC-GA-CORE
"SLO dashboards + burn alerts","Build Grafana dashboards for p95 latency, error rate, and burn-rate alerts using OTEL metrics.","AC1 (Ops): Dashboards show p50/p95/p99 for graph queries and connector throughput. AC2 (Performance): Burn alerts trigger on 2x SLO consumption over 1h. AC3 (Usability): On-call can export panel JSON and runbook link is visible.","Dashboards committed; alerts tested in staging; screenshot added to runbook; OTEL pipelines documented.",[ops;ga-core],EPIC-OPS-GUARD
"Cost guardrail budgeting","Add budget per workspace, slow-query killer, and archival tiering policy.","AC1 (Policy-by-Default): Queries above budget are blocked with explanation and appeal link. AC2 (Performance): Slow-query killer terminates workloads exceeding threshold and records audit. AC3 (FinOps): Monthly budget report exported to object storage.","Cost guard config checked in; k6 plan updated; kill-switch tested; documentation updated.",[ops;finops;ethics],EPIC-OPS-GUARD
"Chaos drill harness","Introduce pod/broker kill drills with rollback and verification checks.","AC1 (Ops): Harness can target pod/broker classes with configurable blast radius. AC2 (Resilience): Post-drill verification confirms service health and audit continuity. AC3 (Governance): Drills require change ticket and produce report artifact.","Playbook authored; automation script stubbed; dry-run executed; report template added.",[ops;ga-core],EPIC-OPS-GUARD
"Offline incident kit v1","Package offline troubleshooting kit with redacted demo data and query recipes.","AC1 (Usability): Kit bundles docs, data, and scripts runnable without network. AC2 (Policy-by-Default): Redacted dataset validated to exclude PII. AC3 (Ops): Checklist includes citation-ready KPIs.","Bundle zip created; checksum recorded; instructions added; validation script run.",[ops;ethics],EPIC-OPS-GUARD
"Selective disclosure exports","Enable export bundles with selective disclosure, licensing checks, and appeals.","AC1 (Policy-by-Default): Export requires license/TOS validation and authority binding. AC2 (Provenance Integrity): Bundle embeds manifest and claim ledger reference. AC3 (UI Usability): User can choose disclosure tiers before export.","Exporter updated; manifest wallet documented; integration test added; demo runbook updated.",[prov-ledger;ethics;experience],EPIC-PROV-LEDGER
"Runbook demos R1–R3/R9","Refresh runbooks with demo data, KPIs, and citation checkpoints for sprint showcase.","AC1 (Hypothesis Rigor): Each runbook captures hypothesis/decision points. AC2 (ER Explainability): Screenshots show rationale overlays. AC3 (Ops): Runbooks list failure modes and rollback steps.","Runbooks updated; screenshots planned; reviewer checklist complete; linked to dashboard panels.",[ga-core;xai;ops],EPIC-GA-CORE
