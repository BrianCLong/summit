## Mission

Publish a stabilization handoff plan that captures every exit criterion, readiness gate, and evidence
handoff, ensuring no stabilization activity exists outside governed tracking.

## Phases

1. **Stabilization inventory**
   - Enumerate stabilization items and align them with authoritative governance definitions.
   - Identify dependencies and readiness impacts.
2. **Handoff sequencing**
   - Order stabilization work into a handoff sequence with owners and deadlines.
   - Define exit criteria and required evidence for each step.
3. **Governed signoff**
   - Record signoffs and evidence links for each stabilization milestone.

## Deliverables

- Stabilization handoff sequence with owners and deadlines.
- Exit criteria checklist with evidence references.
- Governed signoff log for stabilization milestones.

## Guardrails

- Stabilization work must remain aligned to readiness and governance authority files.
- Governed exceptions are allowed only with explicit documentation.
