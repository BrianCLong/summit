## Mission

Deliver field deployment playbooks that guide production rollouts with governance alignment,
readiness gates, and verified checklists.

## Phases

1. **Playbook structure**
   - Define the deployment phases and required evidence per phase.
   - Align with tenant profile definitions and GA launch gates.
2. **Operational runbooks**
   - Draft runbooks for rollout, rollback, and incident escalation.
   - Embed evidence capture and governance signoff steps.
3. **Field validation**
   - Validate playbooks with readiness assertion requirements and owner signoff.

## Deliverables

- Field deployment playbooks with phase checklists.
- Rollout/rollback runbooks and escalation procedures.
- Validation summary with evidence references.

## Guardrails

- Deployment steps must align to readiness authority files.
- Playbooks require explicit evidence capture and signoff.
