## Mission

Stand up the intelligence lab sprint to operationalize experimentation into governed backlog items
with explicit policy alignment and readiness constraints.

## Phases

1. **Experiment intake**
   - Define experiment intake criteria and governance mapping.
   - Establish evidence capture and success thresholds.
2. **Lab execution**
   - Run experiments with clear decision logs and policy references.
   - Capture outputs and readiness impacts.
3. **Backlog conversion**
   - Convert validated findings into roadmap-ready initiatives with owners and evidence links.

## Deliverables

- Intelligence lab intake template and criteria.
- Experiment execution log with evidence links.
- Backlog conversion report with governed signoffs.

## Guardrails

- Lab outcomes must align to authority files and readiness assertion.
- Experiments are recorded with full evidence capture.
