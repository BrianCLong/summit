## Mission

Deliver a production incident readiness plan that ties response triggers, roles, and evidence capture
back to governance requirements and readiness authority files.

## Phases

1. **Risk inventory**
   - Enumerate production risks and map them to governance mandates.
   - Define escalation thresholds and ownership.
2. **Incident workflow**
   - Codify the incident response workflow with evidence capture and decision logs.
   - Align escalation steps with readiness assertion requirements.
3. **Readiness validation**
   - Produce validation exercises that confirm response readiness.

## Deliverables

- Production risk register with governance mappings.
- Incident response workflow and evidence templates.
- Readiness validation exercises with evidence checkpoints.

## Guardrails

- Incident workflows must remain aligned to GA governance authority files.
- Exceptions are governed and recorded.
