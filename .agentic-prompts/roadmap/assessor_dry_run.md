## Mission

Execute a full dry run of the assessor workflow using the authoritative readiness sources and evidence
paths. Capture every decision and gate as a governed artifact so the real review follows the same
sequence without deviations.

## Phases

1. **Scope confirmation**
   - Confirm the governing authority files and readiness assertion as the sole sources of truth.
   - Lock the checklist of inputs, evidence paths, and reviewers.
2. **Dry run execution**
   - Walk through each assessor gate in order with evidence capture and signoff notes.
   - Record any governed exceptions explicitly and tie them to authority files.
3. **Remediation loop**
   - Generate a remediation backlog for gaps that block readiness.
   - Assign owners and target evidence artifacts for each gap.

## Deliverables

- Dry run checklist aligned to readiness assertion.
- Evidence index for every gate.
- Remediation backlog with owners and governed exception notes.

## Guardrails

- No domain logic changes; only planning, evidence capture, and documentation updates.
- Every artifact must cite the readiness assertion and governance authority files.
