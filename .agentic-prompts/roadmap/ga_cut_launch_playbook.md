## Mission

Deliver the GA cut launch playbook with deterministic gates, evidence mapping, and owner signoffs so
no launch action bypasses governance authority.

## Phases

1. **Gate definition**
   - Enumerate launch gates and map them to readiness authority files.
   - Identify required evidence and owners for each gate.
2. **Playbook assembly**
   - Build the launch sequence with explicit approvals and rollback paths.
   - Align with incident readiness and reviewer onboarding outputs.
3. **Validation**
   - Validate the playbook against readiness assertion requirements.

## Deliverables

- GA cut launch playbook with gate checklist.
- Evidence mapping and approval matrix.
- Validation report aligned to readiness assertion.

## Guardrails

- No launch step proceeds without evidence capture and signoff.
- Governance sources remain authoritative for all gate definitions.
