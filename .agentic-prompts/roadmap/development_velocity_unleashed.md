## Mission

Build a velocity program that eliminates friction in planning, execution, and verification while
preserving governance gates and evidence discipline.

## Phases

1. **Throughput audit**
   - Identify cycle-time bottlenecks and redundant steps in the current workflow.
   - Align remediation to governance requirements and readiness constraints.
2. **Acceleration plan**
   - Introduce streamlined handoffs, automation, and standardized checklists.
   - Ensure every acceleration step retains evidence capture.
3. **Velocity governance**
   - Define metrics and guardrails that keep accelerated work within policy boundaries.

## Deliverables

- Throughput bottleneck report with remediation actions.
- Velocity acceleration playbook and checklist.
- Metrics dashboard definitions and guardrails.

## Guardrails

- No removal of governance gates.
- Evidence capture remains mandatory for every accelerated step.
