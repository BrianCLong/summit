## Mission

Deliver observer experience improvements that preserve deployable-first workflows and align to
readiness authority files. Every enhancement must be tied to explicit governance definitions.

## Phases

1. **Observer journey mapping**
   - Map the observer workflow and identify friction points.
   - Align enhancements with governance and readiness constraints.
2. **Experience upgrades**
   - Define observer-facing improvements and acceptance criteria.
   - Ensure each upgrade includes evidence of governance alignment.
3. **Readiness alignment**
   - Validate that observer enhancements remain within deployable-first guardrails.

## Deliverables

- Observer journey map with prioritized improvements.
- Acceptance criteria and evidence references.
- Readiness alignment checklist for observer enhancements.

## Guardrails

- No divergence from deployable-first workflow stages.
- Every change must cite authority files.
