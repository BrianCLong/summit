## Mission

Publish the governance model for agent mesh operations, including permissions, auditability, and
escalation rules, enforced through authoritative GA governance sources.

## Phases

1. **Governance model**
   - Enumerate agent roles, permissions, and authority boundaries.
   - Map governance requirements to policy-as-code enforcement.
2. **Auditability and evidence**
   - Define audit trails, evidence expectations, and escalation triggers.
   - Align with readiness assertion and governance constitution.
3. **Operational enforcement**
   - Produce enforcement checklists and governance validation steps.

## Deliverables

- Agent mesh governance model and role matrix.
- Auditability and escalation playbook.
- Enforcement checklist with evidence capture steps.

## Guardrails

- Governance definitions must align to authority files.
- No agent operation proceeds without auditability.
