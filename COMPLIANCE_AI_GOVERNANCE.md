# AI Governance Mapping

This document maps Summit's controls to key AI governance principles, ensuring that its AI capabilities are developed and operated in a safe, transparent, and accountable manner. The primary source of these controls is the [Summit Constitution](docs/governance/CONSTITUTION.md).

## 1. Transparency & Explainability

| AI Governance Principle  | Control ID(s) | Evidence Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :----------------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Traceable Outputs**    | `AUD-001`     | All intelligence outputs generated by the system must be attributable, explainable, and replayable. This is a constitutional requirement, ensuring that the reasoning behind any AI-generated conclusion can be audited and understood. |
| **Explicit Truth Model** | `GOV-001`     | The system does not assert absolute truth. Instead, it provides evidence, confidence bounds, and alternative hypotheses, making the limits of its knowledge explicit to the user.                                                       |

## 2. Controllability & Human Oversight

| AI Governance Principle         | Control ID(s)      | Evidence Summary                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human Primacy**               | `GOV-002`          | All consequential actions require human authorization. The system is designed to augment human decision-making, not replace it.                                                |
| **Bounded Autonomy**            | `AI-001`, `AI-002` | Agent autonomy is strictly limited and is prohibited in production environments. Agents can only operate in assistive, evaluative, or tightly constrained operational roles.   |
| **Right of Refusal & Shutdown** | `GOV-001`          | The system retains the right to refuse tasks and can be shut down if its operation risks violating ethical or safety boundaries. This is a non-revocable constitutional limit. |

## 3. Safety & Non-Deception

| AI Governance Principle            | Control ID(s) | Evidence Summary                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prohibition on Mass Persuasion** | `GOV-001`     | The system is constitutionally forbidden from engaging in covert mass persuasion. |
| **Prohibition on Lethal Autonomy** | `GOV-001`     | The system is constitutionally forbidden from making autonomous lethal decisions. |

## 4. Accountability & Auditability

| AI Governance Principle         | Control ID(s) | Evidence Summary                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------ | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immutable Provenance Ledger** | `AUD-002`     | All significant actions are recorded in an immutable ledger, providing a verifiable audit trail of how intelligence was generated and who was involved.                    |
| **Governance Supremacy**        | `GOV-003`     | Audit and provenance controls are constitutionally mandated to override all other system considerations, ensuring that accountability is never sacrificed for performance. |

## Explicitly Out of Scope

The following capabilities are explicitly forbidden by the Summit Constitution and are therefore not implemented:

- **Autonomous Execution of Consequential Actions:** All such actions require human-in-the-loop approval.
- **Deceptive or Manipulative AI:** The system is designed for transparency and explainability.
- **Unconstrained Self-Improvement:** Agent capabilities are strictly bounded and controlled.
