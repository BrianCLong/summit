# Sprint Status Report: v0.5-guarded-rail

**Date:** 2025-09-13
**Status:** âœ… All artifacts scaffolded.

This report summarizes the execution of the sprint plan. All planned, non-code artifacts have been created, establishing the technical foundation and documentation for the sprint objectives.

## Risk Burn-Down

The initial risks have been mitigated by the following artifacts:

1.  **Risk:** `Cypher validity plateau <95%`
    *   **Mitigation:** While the core AI model was not trained, the surrounding infrastructure for testing and validation is now in place. The risk is partially burned down by establishing a clear success metric.

2.  **Risk:** `Connector rate limiting blocks tests`
    *   **Mitigation:** This risk is addressed in the sprint plan's acceptance criteria, which specifies using sample datasets and local stubs. This is a procedural mitigation.

3.  **Risk:** `SLO target misses`
    *   **Mitigation:** This risk is significantly burned down by the creation of a comprehensive performance and observability harness. The following evidence artifacts directly address this:
        *   `tests/k6/smoke.js`, `tests/k6/baseline.js`, `tests/k6/soak.js`
        *   `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/graphql-slo.json`
        *   `monitoring/prometheus/burn-alerts.rules.yml`
        *   `docs/architecture/caching-strategy.md`
