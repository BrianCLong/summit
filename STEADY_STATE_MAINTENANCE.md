# üöÇ IntelGraph GREEN TRAIN - Steady State Maintenance

## üéØ Mission Status: DELIVERED ‚úÖ

The GREEN TRAIN release engineering mission has been successfully completed. All critical infrastructure, observability, and deployment safety mechanisms are now operational.

## üìã 7-Day Stabilization Runbook

### **Day 0 (Completed)** ‚úÖ

- [x] Tagged release: `release/green-train-20250921`
- [x] Merge queue freeze activated (hotfixes only)
- [x] Error budget monitoring enabled (GraphQL p95, ingest E2E, worker fail %)
- [x] Renovate configuration updated for steady-state maintenance

### **Day 1-2 (Bug Bash Phase)**

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Bug bash across preview environments (UI + runbooks R1-R6)
- [ ] Triage board setup: `P0 crash`, `P1 degraded`, `P2 papercuts`
- [ ] Performance re-baseline: capture flamegraphs for top 10 resolvers, top 3 workers

**Commands:**

```bash
# Deploy preview environment for testing
./scripts/preview-local.sh up

# Run comprehensive health checks
./scripts/rollback-deployment.sh health-check

# Generate performance baseline
npm run perf:baseline

# Run bug bash checklist
npm run test:golden-path
```

### **Day 3-4 (Security & Cost Pass)**

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Security sweep: address _all_ Trivy HIGH/CRITICAL or add allowlist entries with 30-day expiry
- [ ] Cost pass: CI minutes, preview env TTLs, egress
- [ ] Set budget alerts

**Commands:**

```bash
# Security scan
npm run security:scan

# Cost analysis
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces

# Preview environment cleanup
./scripts/preview-local.sh clean
```

### **Day 5-6 (Chaos & Observability)**

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Chaos drills (staging): kill pods/brokers; validate auto-recover + DLQ drainage
- [ ] Observability audit: ensure spans/metrics for workers have cardinality guards and exemplars

**Commands:**

```bash
# Run chaos engineering drills
./scripts/chaos-drill.sh all-drills --namespace intelgraph-staging

# Validate observability stack
curl $GRAFANA_URL/api/health
curl $PROMETHEUS_URL/api/v1/status/targets

# Check worker metrics
kubectl logs -n intelgraph-staging -l component=worker --tail=100
```

### **Day 7 (Debrief & Unfreeze)**

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Debrief: write 1-page "Green Train Lessons" (what sped us up, what hurt)
- [ ] Unfreeze features; announce "merge train cadence" (weekly)
- [ ] Finalize steady-state procedures

   - Enable `strictNullChecks` in more packages
   - Add `Result<T,E>` boundaries for error handling
   - Remove remaining `any` types with Zod guards

2. **React 19 Follow-through**:
   - Finalize strict-effects audit notes
   - Add codemods & ESLint rules to prevent regressions
   - Update component patterns for concurrent features

Daily Tasks:
1. Review Renovate PRs; batch minors, isolate majors with preview environments
2. Post TypeScript error histogram delta vs yesterday; open targeted fix PRs
3. Generate weekly "perf & cost" digest (p95, worker failures, CI minutes)
4. Enforce policy gates (SAST/SBOM compliance)

Output Format: PR comments with concrete diffs, daily green status reports, and weekly performance digests.

Context: All GREEN TRAIN infrastructure is operational:
