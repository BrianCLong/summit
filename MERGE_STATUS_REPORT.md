# IntelGraph PR Merge Status Report

## Current Status: üö® BLOCKED - Critical File Corruption Detected

### Completed Actions:
1. ‚úÖ **Set up release branch**: `release/2025-08-17-merge-sweep`
2. ‚úÖ **PR Inventory**: Analyzed 67 active PRs (not 74 as originally stated)
3. ‚úÖ **Closed Duplicates**: Removed 3 duplicate PRs (464, 474, 439)
4. ‚úÖ **Documentation Merges**: Successfully merged 3 low-risk documentation PRs:
   - PR 483: PsyOps risk assessment docs
   - PR 390: Roadmap expansion docs  
   - PR 475: Narrative generation docs

### üö® Critical Issues Discovered:

#### File Corruption in Core System Files:
- `server/src/resolvers/WargameResolver.ts`: Contains duplicate class definitions and malformed Cypher queries with TypeScript code injection
- `server/src/ai/engines/VideoFrameExtractor.ts`: Syntax error in destructuring assignment
- `server/src/graphql/resolvers/aiAnalysis.ts`: Character encoding issues causing TypeScript parse errors
- `server/src/routes/export.js`: Merge conflict markers present

#### Current Build Status:
- **Server Build**: ‚ùå FAILING (200+ TypeScript errors)
- **Client Build**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (Parse errors in graphSlice.js)
- **Lint Status**: 865 problems (manageable, mostly warnings)

### Next Actions Required:

#### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (CRITICAL)
1. **Fix Core File Corruption**:
   - Restore clean version of `WargameResolver.ts` (remove duplicate class, fix queries)
   - Fix syntax error in `VideoFrameExtractor.ts`
   - Resolve encoding issues in `aiAnalysis.ts`
   - Clean merge conflicts in `export.js`

#### Phase 2: Establish Clean Baseline
1. Verify TypeScript compilation passes
2. Ensure lint errors are at acceptable baseline
3. Run smoke tests to confirm functionality

#### Phase 3: Resume Systematic Merging
1. Start with lowest-risk PRs (backend services, bug fixes)
2. Avoid large refactoring PRs until baseline is stable
3. Merge in small batches with smoke tests between each

### Risk Assessment:
- **HIGH RISK**: Current corruption could indicate broader systemic issues
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Many PRs have failing tests/lint, suggesting integration challenges  
- **LOW RISK**: Documentation and simple feature PRs can proceed once baseline is fixed

### Recommendations:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Focus on fixing the 4 corrupted files before any further PR merges
2. **SHORT TERM**: Create automated check to prevent similar corruption
3. **LONG TERM**: Implement stricter PR validation before allowing merges

**Current Merge Count**: 3/64 PRs successfully merged (4.7%)
**Estimated Time to Complete**: 8-12 hours (pending corruption fixes)
