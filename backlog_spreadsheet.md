| Epic 1 — High-Risk Ops v0.1 (TEMP_DB_READ_ACCESS) | Sprint 1 – Golden path skeleton | Story 1.1 — Create High-Risk Ops domain model | Define DB models/entities for HighRiskOperationRequest, Approval, Execution, Receipt. | Persistence for request (type, target, duration, justification, status); approvals (approver, status, timestamp, comment); execution (status, timestamps); receipt (id, refs). Migrations applied and visible. Unit tests assert CRUD. |
| Epic 1 — High-Risk Ops v0.1 (TEMP_DB_READ_ACCESS) | Sprint 1 – Golden path skeleton | Story 1.2 — High-Risk Ops API (requests & approvals) | REST/gRPC endpoints: POST /high-risk-ops/requests; GET /high-risk-ops/requests/:id; POST /high-risk-ops/requests/:id/approve. | Request validation: type=TEMP_DB_READ_ACCESS, duration ≤2h, justification present.
