final polish (optional but recommended)

Protect the GA tag pattern (vYYYY.MM.DD-\*) in your release train docs.

Lock environment protections for prod (reviewers required; restrict “who can deploy”).

Create a post-release review issue to tune burn-rate thresholds after 7 days of prod data.

Turn on issue templates for incidents & postmortems; link them in runbooks.
