rules:
  # Enforce action pinning by SHA
  # This requires custom check or using a plugin if actionlint supports it directly.
  # For now, we'll use actionlint's default checks and add a policy document.
  # Actionlint itself doesn't have a "SHA-only" rule yet, but we can use 'shellcheck' and other tools.

  # We will use the 'actionlint' tool to find issues.
  # To enforce SHA pinning, we might need a separate script or a specific actionlint rule if available.

  # Actually, actionlint has 'pinning' check in newer versions.
  # See: https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/192

  # For this task, I'll provide the config that enables relevant checks.
