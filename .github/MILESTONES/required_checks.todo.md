# Required Checks Discovery (Temporary)

**Status:** Deferred pending GitHub UI confirmation.

## Goal
Capture the exact required status check names enforced by branch protection rules and map them to CI workflows.

## Discovery Steps
1. Open the repository settings → **Branches**.
2. Locate the branch protection rule for `main`.
3. Copy the exact required status check names shown.
4. Record the names below, including any workflow/job prefixes.

## Temporary Placeholder Names (to be replaced)
- ci-agentic-hive / policy
- ci-agentic-hive / evidence
- ci-agentic-hive / e2e-scenarios

## Rename Plan
Once the exact names are confirmed, update this file and align any workflow/job names to the required checks list.
