## Summary
[What/why]

## Canary Plan
- Metrics to watch: [p95 latency, error rate, saturation]
- Ramp: 5% → 20% → 50% → 100% (hold 20% for 30–60m)
- Rollback trigger(s): [SLO burn > X, error rate > Y, anomaly Z]
- Rollback steps: `helm rollback <release> <rev>` + feature flag off

## Migration Gate (if applicable)
- [ ] Schema/contract change
- Gate: apply behind flag; run forward/backward compat tests

## Observability
- [ ] New traces/metrics/logs added
- Dashboards/alerts link:

## Security/Compliance
- [ ] Secrets via sealed-secrets
- [ ] SBOM attached; SAST/SCA clean

## Verification
- [ ] Smoke checks
- [ ] Golden path e2e: ingest → resolve → runbook → report
