      # Note: In a production environment, this workflow would depend on test/build workflows
      # and use actions/download-artifact to retrieve:
      # - test-summary-junit.xml (from unit tests)
      # - slo-results.json (from slo-exporter or similar)
      # - vulns-*.txt (from security scans)
      #
      # For now, the calculator script will use defaults or file artifacts committed/present in the repo.
