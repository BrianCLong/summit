# Release Verification Workflow
#
# Enforces strict manifest verification for release tags.
# This workflow runs when tags matching 'v*' are pushed and ensures:
# - The checkout is exactly at the tagged commit (--strict)
# - The manifest commit matches the tag commit (--expect-sha)
#
# To make this workflow a required status check:
# 1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches
# 2. Add/edit branch protection rules for release branches or tag patterns
# 3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
# 4. Select "Release Verify / verify" as a required check
