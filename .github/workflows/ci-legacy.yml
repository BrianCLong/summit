name: CI Legacy (Non-Blocking)

# This workflow contains NON-BLOCKING checks:
# - Quarantined flaky tests
# - Legacy test suites (Jest/ts-jest with ESM issues)
# - Experimental features
# - Deprecated checks being migrated
#
# None of these jobs block PR merges. They provide informational feedback only.
