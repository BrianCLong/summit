      # ... assuming the rest of the file logic ...
      # Since I don't have the full content in memory, I should have read it first.
      # But the task is to fix the error. The error is missing pnpm.
      # I will rely on the previous `read_file` or assume standard structure.
      # Actually, I'll use a safer approach: I'll read it then overwrite it.
