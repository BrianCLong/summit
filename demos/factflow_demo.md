# FactFlow Demo Script (15 min)

## Intro (2 min)
"Thanks for taking the time. I'll show you FactFlow in action,
then we can discuss if it's a fit for [Newsroom Name]."

## Problem Statement (2 min)
"When you cover live events — debates, press conferences —
how do you currently fact-check claims in real-time?"

[Listen to their answer]

"Most newsrooms I talk to either:
1. Miss claims entirely (too fast)
2. Fact-check after the event (too slow)
3. Rely on memory (error-prone)"

## Solution Demo (8 min)
[Share screen]

1. Show live transcription (paste sample transcript)
2. Watch claims auto-extracted
3. Evidence retrieval happens in parallel
4. Verdict displays in <5 seconds

"Here's what you'd see during a live debate:
- Speaker A claims 'Unemployment is 3%'
- FactFlow extracts that claim
- Searches BLS data
- Returns: FALSE — actual rate is 3.9%
- Reporter sees this in real-time during broadcast"

## Pricing & Next Steps (3 min)

Would you be interested in a 30-day free trial
