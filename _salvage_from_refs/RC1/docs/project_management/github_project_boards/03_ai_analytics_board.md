## To Do

*   **Story:** As an analyst, I want the platform to automatically identify potential connections and relationships in my data.
    *   **Task:** Implement the "GraphRAG" feature as described in `VISION.md`.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The "GraphRAG" feature is implemented as described in `VISION.md`. The feature uses graph algorithms and NLP to identify and score potential connections.
        *   **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Use graph algorithms (e.g., community detection, centrality analysis) to identify key entities and relationships.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A library of graph algorithms is integrated into the platform. The algorithms can be run on any graph in the platform.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Use natural language processing (NLP) to extract entities and relationships from unstructured text.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** An NLP pipeline is created that can extract entities and relationships from unstructured text. The pipeline is integrated with the data ingestion process.
        *   **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
*   **Story:** As an analyst, I want to be able to ask questions in natural language and get answers from the platform.
    *   **Task:** Implement a natural language query interface that translates user questions into GraphQL queries.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A natural language query interface is implemented that allows users to ask questions in natural language. The interface translates user questions into GraphQL queries and returns the results.
        *   **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Use a large language model (LLM) to generate natural language summaries of query results.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** An LLM is integrated into the platform. The LLM is used to generate natural language summaries of query results.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
*   **Story:** As a data scientist, I want to be able to easily integrate my own machine learning models into the platform.
    *   **Task:** Create a "Connector SDK" as described in `velocity-plan-v6.md`.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A "Connector SDK" is created that allows data scientists to easily integrate their own machine learning models into the platform. The SDK is well-documented and easy to use.
        *   **Estimate:** 8 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Document the process for creating and deploying custom models.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The process for creating and deploying custom models is documented in the platform's administration guide.
        *   **Estimate:** 3 Story Points
*   **Story:** As an analyst, I want to be able to understand how the platform arrived at its conclusions.
    *   **Task:** Implement explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide insights into how the AI models are making their decisions.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** XAI techniques are implemented to provide insights into how the AI models are making their decisions. The insights are displayed in a user-friendly way.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
    *   **Task:** Visualize the evidence and provenance for each insight.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The evidence and provenance for each insight is visualized in the graph. Users can easily see where the data came from and how it was processed.
        *   **Estimate:** 5 Story Points
