# Multimodal Data Schema Guide

## Overview

The IntelGraph Multimodal Data Schema is a P0 Critical MVP1 feature that enables extraction, storage, and analysis of entities and relationships from multiple data modalities including text, images, audio, and video. This schema extends the existing IntelGraph data model to support cross-modal intelligence operations.

## Key Features

### 1. Media Source Management

- **Metadata Preservation**: Complete metadata tracking including EXIF data, timestamps, and provenance
- **Quality Assessment**: Automated quality scoring for media sources
- **Deduplication**: Content-based deduplication using cryptographic checksums

### 2. Cross-Modal Entity Extraction
- **Multiple Extractors**: Support for various extraction pipelines (spaCy, Transformers, Computer Vision, OCR, Speech-to-Text)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-level confidence assessment with verification workflows
- **Spatial Context**: Bounding boxes for image/video entities, geographic coordinates
- **Temporal Context**: Time-bound entities for audio/video with transcript support

### 3. Cross-Modal Matching
- **Similarity Detection**: Advanced algorithms for finding entities across different media types
- **Semantic Clustering**: Grouping related entities based on semantic similarity
- **Relationship Inference**: Cross-modal relationship discovery and validation

### 4. Quality and Verification
- **Human Verification**: Workflow for expert validation of extracted entities
- **Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive scoring including accuracy, consistency, and completeness
- **Duplicate Detection**: Advanced similarity matching to identify and merge duplicates

## Schema Components

### Cross-Modal Features

#### CrossModalMatch
Links entities found in different media types:
```graphql
type CrossModalMatch {

## Usage Examples

### 1. Upload and Process Media

```graphql
# Upload a video file
mutation UploadVideo {
  uploadMedia(input: {
    uri: "/uploads/surveillance_video.mp4"
    mediaType: VIDEO
    mimeType: "video/mp4"
    filename: "surveillance_video.mp4"
    metadata: {
      duration: 3600
      resolution: "1920x1080"
      camera_location: "Building A Entrance"
    }
  }) {
    id
    uri
    mediaType
  }
}

# Start extraction job
mutation ExtractEntities {
  startExtractionJob(input: {
    mediaSourceId: "media123"
    extractionMethods: [COMPUTER_VISION, SPEECH_TO_TEXT]
    investigationId: "inv456"
  }) {
    id
    status
    progress
  }
}
```

### 2. Query Cross-Modal Entities

```graphql
# Find entities across different media types
query CrossModalSearch {
  multimodalSearch(input: {
    query: "suspicious individual"
    mediaTypes: [IMAGE, VIDEO, AUDIO]
    minConfidence: 0.7
    includeCrossModal: true
    investigationId: "inv456"
  }) {
    entities {
      id
      label
      confidence
      extractionMethod
      extractedFrom {
        mediaType
        filename
      }
      crossModalMatches {
        similarity
