# Cost Governance Automation

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the strategy for automating cost governance within the IntelGraph platform, ensuring efficient resource utilization, cost transparency, and proactive budget management.

## 2. Real-time Cost Monitoring Dashboards

*   **Strategy**: Provide real-time visibility into cloud spending across all environments and services.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Tools**: Integrate with cloud provider cost management tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management) and third-party solutions (e.g., CloudHealth, FinOps).
    *   **Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards in Grafana or dedicated FinOps platforms to visualize spending by service, environment, team, and project.
    *   **Granularity**: Break down costs by Kubernetes namespaces, labels, and resource tags.

## 3. Budget Alerts

*   **Strategy**: Proactively notify relevant stakeholders when spending approaches predefined budget thresholds.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Cloud Provider Alerts**: Configure budget alerts directly within cloud provider cost management services.
    *   **Custom Alerts**: Set up custom alerts in monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager) based on cost metrics.
    *   **Channels**: Send notifications via Slack, email, or PagerDuty.

## 4. Spot/Preemptible Node Pool Policies

*   **Strategy**: Utilize cost-effective Spot Instances (AWS) or Preemptible VMs (GCP) for non-critical, fault-tolerant workloads to significantly reduce compute costs.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Node Pools**: Create separate node pools in Kubernetes clusters specifically for Spot/Preemptible instances.
    *   **Taints and Tolerations**: Use Kubernetes taints and tolerations to schedule appropriate workloads onto these nodes.
    *   **Safe Eviction**: Implement graceful shutdown mechanisms for pods running on Spot instances to handle preemptions.
    *   **Workload Identification**: Clearly identify non-critical workloads suitable for Spot instances (e.g., batch jobs, development environments, stateless services).

## 5. Rightsizing Recommendations

*   **Strategy**: Automatically identify opportunities to optimize resource allocation (CPU, memory) for workloads based on historical usage patterns.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Metrics Collection**: Collect detailed resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory) for all pods and deployments.
    *   **Analysis Tools**: Use tools like Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in recommendation mode, or third-party solutions (e.g., Goldilocks, Datadog) to analyze metrics and generate rightsizing recommendations.
    *   **Automation**: Explore automating the application of rightsizing recommendations where appropriate.

## 6. Cost Optimization Initiatives

*   **Reserved Instances/Savings Plans**: Purchase Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for stable, long-running workloads.
*   **Storage Optimization**: Implement lifecycle policies for object storage, tiering, and deletion of old data.
*   **Network Optimization**: Optimize data transfer costs by minimizing cross-region traffic and leveraging private networking.
*   **Managed Services**: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of managed services versus self-managed solutions.
