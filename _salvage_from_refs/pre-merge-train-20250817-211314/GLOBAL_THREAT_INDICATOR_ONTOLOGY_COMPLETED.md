# Issue Closed: global_threat_indicator_ontology

This issue has been resolved and is now closed.

## Summary

Established a shared ontology for global threat indicators to align terminology across intelligence efforts.

## Implementation Details

- Authored taxonomy definitions and relationships in the knowledge graph.
- Published documentation for contributors and partner teams.
- Implemented dynamic classification for ingested entities based on observed indicators such as MITRE ATT&CK TTP IDs and CVE references.
- Added a UI summary badge that surfaces total indicator counts to highlight classification results.

## Next Steps

- Host community review sessions to gather ontology feedback.
- Map newly discovered indicator types into the existing taxonomy.
- Version ontology releases and document changes for adopters.
