# Issue Closed: entity_edge_mapping

This issue has been resolved and is now closed.

## Summary

Created comprehensive mappings between entities and their relationships to support downstream graph analytics.

## Implementation Details

- Consolidated disparate data sources into a normalized graph model.
- Implemented validation routines to ensure edge integrity and provenance.

## Next Steps

- Develop a query library that leverages the normalized graph model.
- Set up scheduled jobs to sync new datasets into the mapping.
- Validate edge integrity after each sync to maintain provenance.
