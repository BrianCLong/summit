# Epic: Real-Time Threat Simulation & 'What-If' Analysis

Milestone: MVP1-Simulation

Introduces the Adversarial LLM Threat Simulation Sandbox, enabling controlled exploration of AI-enabled attack chains. The sandbox orchestrates phishing, exploit development, influence operations, supply-chain scenarios, credential stuffing, deepfake impersonation, and ransomware drills while enforcing safety governors and exhaustive logging. See [Adversarial LLM Threat Simulation Sandbox](../../ADVERSARIAL_LLM_THREAT_SIMULATION_SANDBOX.md) for the full capabilities and architecture.

## Sandbox Overview

- **Purpose:** Simulate how threat actors could use large language models for offensive operations and test defenses.
- **Scenarios:** Phishing, exploit-kit or obfuscation code, coordinated influence operations, credential stuffing, deepfake impersonation, and ransomware or data-exfiltration playbooks.
- **Features:** Internal red-team LLMs with safety governors, a sandbox environment to track misuse, deception layers with honey tokens, a scenario authoring DSL, and evaluation scorecards.
