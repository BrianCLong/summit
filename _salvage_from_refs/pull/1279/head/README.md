> Autonomous release train with risk-aware agents, cost optimization, and stronger governance

## 🎯 Vision

Scale from "fast CI & first-gen agents" to risk-aware, cost-optimized, self-healing automation that merges safe PRs and ships on a schedule with high confidence.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🤖 Agent Cooperation System
- **Critic Agent**: Comprehensive static analysis with ESLint, TypeScript, security checks
- **Fixer Agent**: Automated fixing strategies with rollback support  
- **Reflective Loop**: Self-improving cycles with convergence detection
- **Health Bot**: PR analysis with 8-factor health scoring

### 🧠 Intelligence & Memory
- **Semantic Memory**: Vector-based search with relationship mapping
- **Prompt Caching**: LRU cache with similarity matching (40-60% cost savings)
- **Capability Router**: Budget-aware model selection across providers
- **Experience Learning**: Success/failure pattern recognition

### 🚀 Performance & Scale
- **Dynamic Test Sharding**: Time-balanced allocation (3-5x faster CI)
- **Incremental Builds**: Turborepo with affected-only execution
- **Service Containers**: Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Redis orchestration

### 🛡️ Security & Governance  
- **SLSA L3 Compliance**: Supply chain security with Cosign signing
- **Risk Scoring**: 10-factor evidence-based analysis
- **Policy DSL**: Human-readable governance rules
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Grype integration with attestations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Command Setup
```bash
# Open in devcontainer (VS Code)
code . --command "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

# Or manual setup
npm install
npm run build
```

### Core Commands
```bash
