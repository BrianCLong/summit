"""
Advanced social listening scaffold.

Design goals:
- Multi-source ingestion (RSS, X/Twitter API v2, Reddit, Mastodon, news feeds)
- Normalization to a common schema with source weights and provenance
- Rate-limit aware, backoff, and content de-duplication via hashing
- Pluggable NER + event extraction (spaCy, stanza) + sentiment

This module provides interfaces and stubs; actual API credentials and
connectors should be added per deployment.
