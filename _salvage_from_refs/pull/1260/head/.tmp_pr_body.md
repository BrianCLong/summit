This integration branch consolidates all conflict-free merges into main.

Summary
- Branch: \
- Merged: 501
- Skipped due to conflicts: 399

Artifacts
- See \ in this branch for a full log of merged vs. skipped items.

Follow-ups
- I will resolve the highest-value conflicts next (feature/rename-summit, feature/release-2.5.0-dash, server deps like express/eslint).
- CI should validate this combined set; any regressions will be addressed before merging to main.
