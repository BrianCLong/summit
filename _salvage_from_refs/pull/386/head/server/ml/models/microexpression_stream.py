"""Streaming microexpression analysis scaffold.

This module provides a lightweight example of how real-time
microexpression detection could be integrated into IntelGraph's
AI pipeline. It operates on an iterable of video frames and yields
classified expressions with confidence scores.

The implementation is intentionally simple and does not depend on
heavy computer vision libraries. It can be extended to use models
such as OpenFace or proprietary detectors.
