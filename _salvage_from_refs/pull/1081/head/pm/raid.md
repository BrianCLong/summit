## Weekly RAID Summary

### New This Week
- **Risks**: 1 new risk identified (R007 - Infrastructure scaling)
- **Issues**: 2 new issues raised (I005, I006)  
- **Assumptions**: 0 assumptions added
- **Dependencies**: 1 new dependency identified (D007 - Monitoring tool access)

### Resolved This Week  
- **Risks**: 0 risks closed
- **Issues**: 0 issues resolved
- **Assumptions**: 2 assumptions validated (A001, A005)
- **Dependencies**: 0 dependencies completed

### Escalation Required
1. **D004 - Customer UAT**: Need immediate confirmation of customer availability for March demonstrations
2. **R001 - Neo4j Performance**: May need additional database engineering expertise if query optimization doesn't resolve performance concerns
3. **D002 - Security Audit**: Potential 3-5 day delay could impact go-live timeline

### Trend Analysis
- **Risk Profile**: Stable - No new high-impact risks, existing mitigation plans progressing
- **Issue Velocity**: Slightly behind - Creating issues faster than resolving, need to focus on closure
- **Dependency Health**: Some delays - 2 of 7 dependencies showing delays or risks

### Action Items for Next Week
1. Complete GraphQL schema unification (I001)
2. Resolve WebSocket connection issues (I003)  
3. Confirm customer demonstration availability (D004)
4. Begin Neo4j performance optimization work (R001)
5. Schedule backup security audit vendor if current vendor delays continue (D002)
