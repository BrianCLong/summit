Priorities

Per-tenant/user rate limits + circuit breaker

DLP: PII tagging & export redaction

Retention policies & archival hooks

Backup + DR drill with runbooks

PR scaffolds

security/rate-limit — feat(security): per-tenant/user limits + breaker

ops/retention — feat(ops): retention policies & archival

ops/backup-drill — chore(ops): DR drill & runbooks

Acceptance criteria

Exports respect redaction by role/sensitivity; PII not logged

TTLs enforced; audit trail for deletions/archival

DR restore: RPO ≤ 15m, RTO ≤ 30m; report committed

Observability

Metrics: rate_limit_exceeded_total, breaker_state, backup timings

Alerts: breaker open >5m (page), snapshot failure (page)

Next steps

Cut branches, draft PRs, schedule DR drill & publish runbooks
