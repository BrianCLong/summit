Acceptance criteria

Duplicate op ID → no-op; LWW resolves races

Presence visible; ghost sessions <0.5%

Conflict toast appears on collisions; audit trail

Collab E2E passes in CI

Observability

Metrics: realtime_conflicts_total, idempotent_hits_total, socket_rtt_ms

Alerts: conflict rate >2% (15m), RTT >150ms (5m)

Next steps

Cut branches, open draft PRs, integrate E2E into required checks
