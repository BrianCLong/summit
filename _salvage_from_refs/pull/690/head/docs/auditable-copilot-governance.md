# Auditable Copilot and Governance

## Natural-Language Querying
- Translate user questions into Cypher or SQL using an LLM.
- Display generated queries for human review before execution.
- Log every query and approval decision for auditing.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Index case corpus and retrieve relevant documents.
- Surface inline citations back to original sources.
- Maintain provenance metadata for each citation.

## Policy-Aware Guardrails
- Enforce ABAC/RBAC checks prior to query execution.
- On denial, return a policy-based explanation to the user.
- Support tenant-specific policies loaded at runtime.

## Security and Governance
- Multi-tenant isolation across data storage and services.
- OIDC/SSO integration with step-up authentication for sensitive actions.
- Comprehensive audit trail capturing who, what, when, and reason-for-access.
- Toolkit for K-anonymity and redaction of sensitive attributes.
- Centralized key management for credentials and encryption keys.

## Implementation Notes
- Use the policy engine to validate permissions and generate denial messages.
- Store audit events in an append-only log service.
- Provide SDK hooks for redaction and anonymization workflows.
