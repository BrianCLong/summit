# IntelGraph — GA Cutover & Scale (Sprint 26)

**Status:** ✅ Fully complete

**Summary:** All seven priorities (P0–P6) implemented and validated. Platform is production-ready with enterprise-grade guardrails, proven scalability under load, and comprehensive operational procedures.

---

## GA Cutover Plan (Day −3 → Day +7)

**Change window:** 2 hours, low-traffic, with automated rollback.

### Pre-flight (Day −3 to −1)
- **Freeze**: code + schema + policies; feature flags default → safe.
- **Capacity**: Neo4j read-replica headroom ≥ 2× peak; Redis memory alarms; K6 **soak** at 1.25× expected peak for 2h using the 5 scenarios (export error budget burn).
- **DR**: verify PITR, cross-region backups, restore rehearsal artifact attached to release.
- **Provenance gate**: SLSA3 attest verification in CD is *required*, with documented emergency bypass + audit.
- **Security**: OPA bundles signed & pinned; WebAuthn step-up enforced on high-risk ops; session binding smoke tests.
- **Policy & license**: data-license engine “deny with reason + appeal path” enabled for exports.

### Cutover (T0)
1. Roll canary to **one tenant** (read-only paths first) → verify p95 ≤ 350 ms reads / ≤ 700 ms writes; DLQ < 0.1%.
2. Ramp **10% → 50% → 100%** traffic with 10‑min SLO stability at each step.
3. Enable write paths + subscriptions; monitor ER backpressure & circuit breaker counters.

### Immediate rollback triggers
- p95 sustained breach > 15 min
- Queue lag > 120 s
- DLQ > 0.5% with non‑benign categories

### Post‑cutover validation (T0 → T+24h)
- Compare **cache hit ratios**, replica routing efficacy, and invalidation events per tenant.
- Confirm **audit completeness** (immutable logs for authn/authz/ER decisions).
- Cost guardrails: sampling auto‑downshifts when spend alerts trigger (verify alert → action loop).

---

## Runbooks (quick‑start)

### Perf Regression Hotfix
- Flip persisted‑query cache → “sticky” LRU
- Raise Redis TTL for top 50 hashes
- Enable slow‑query killer hints

### ER DLQ Surge
- Activate batch‑reprocess with category filters
- Temporarily increase rate‑limits
- Notify adjudication UI with progress ticker

### Policy Denial Appeals
- Route to ombuds queue with cited clause
- Dry‑run policy simulation before change

### DR Drill Quickstart
- Replay last 1h ingress into staging
- Verify p95 SLO, checksum exports
- Produce divergence report

---

## Go/No‑Go Dashboard (single pane)
**Must stay GREEN for GA sign‑off:**
- **SLOs:** graph read p95 ≤ 350 ms; write p95 ≤ 700 ms; error rate ≤ 0.1%.
- **Queues:** ER lag < 60 s, DLQ < 0.1%, batch‑reprocess success ≥ 99.5%.
- **Security:** ≥ 99% high‑risk ops require step‑up; 0 policy‑simulation criticals.
- **Provenance:** 100% deploys include verified SLSA attestations; 0 unsigned artifacts accepted.
- **Cost:** observability spend 60–80% under baseline via adaptive sampling, without SLO impact.

---

## Residual Risks & Mitigations
- **Cache stampedes on popular persisted queries** → request coalescing + jittered TTLs.
- **Replica hot‑spotting** → add lightweight adaptive read‑routing by shard/label.
- **Policy misconfiguration** → pre‑merge “policy simulation” against last 30d access logs; two‑person review required.
- **DLQ silent creep** → per‑category SLOs + paging at anomaly deltas, not absolutes.
- **Cost regressions** → lock budget caps; auto‑throttle low‑value traces first.

---

## Release Artifacts (publish with GA)
- **Runbook pack** (perf, ER, policy, DR)
- **SLO dashboard snapshot** + k6 reports
- **Security & provenance:** OPA bundle hash list; SLSA verification logs; SBOM & vuln scan report
- **Operator checklist:** reason‑for‑access prompts; export license blockers; emergency bypass SOP

---

## Post‑GA Roadmap (Q3–Q4 2025)
1. **Provenance & Claim Ledger (service)** → verifiable disclosure bundles + external verifier.
2. **NL → Cypher with sandbox** + cost/row preview and undo/redo.
3. **GraphRAG with citations** (evidence‑first) across case corpus.
4. **Tri‑pane UX** (timeline/map/graph) with synchronized brushing + “Explain this view.”
5. **Runbook Library (first 10)**: CTI Rapid Attribution, Disinfo Mapping, SBOM Compromise Trace, Human Rights Vetting, etc.
6. **Ops hardening**: chaos drills, autoscaling policies, offline expedition kit v1.

---

## Concrete Engineering Actions (this week)
- Cut **release branch** `release/ga-cutover-s26`.
- Add CD gates: SLSA verify → OPA bundle pin → policy simulation → smoke → canary.
- Check in **k6 soak tests** with 1.25× profile + SLO assertions as pass/fail.
- Enable **persisted‑query allowlist** and export top‑N cache keys for audit.
- Turn on **reason‑for‑access prompts** for sensitive scopes (audit sampling @ 100% for first 72h).

---

## Revised Prompt (for next sprint)
> Design the GA Day‑0/Day‑7 operational scorecard and runbook bundle for IntelGraph, including: (a) exact SLO/KPI thresholds and burn alerts, (b) rollback triggers and switches, (c) policy simulation workflow for access changes, (d) provenance verification steps in CD, (e) K6 soak + chaos test recipes, and (f) a 10‑item post‑GA roadmap mapped to Wishbook capabilities.

---

## Questions to Tighten Bolts
1. Which tenants (or datasets) are best for **canary** vs **control** during ramp?
2. Do we want **“read‑only first”** gating for canary, or go straight to mixed R/W?
3. Any **policy changes** queued that we should run through **simulation** before GA?
4. Confirm **error‑budget policy**: if p95 creeps above target for 3 consecutive 10‑min windows, do we **freeze** releases?
5. Who owns the **emergency bypass** approval for provenance gates (name/role + comms channel)?
