## 🔒 **Alignment Decisions**

| **Decision Point**    | **MVP‑1++ Choice**               | **Rationale**                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Merge Queue**       | Both `release/mvp1++` AND `main` | Critical for linear history and conflict prevention |
| **Canary Strategy**   | **10→50→100% over 24h**          | Safer for enterprise customers, allows monitoring   |
| **Coverage Gate**     | **85% enforced** - blocks merges | Quality over velocity; prevents regression          |
| **Rollback Strategy** | **Blue/Green primary**           | Faster rollback than canary; zero-downtime          |
| **Compliance**        | **SOC2 + 90-day retention**      | Enterprise readiness requirement                    |
