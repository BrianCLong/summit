# Team Setup and Cadence

- **Board columns:** Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA/Acceptance → Done.
- **Daily standup (10 min):** Highlight movement against SLO/acceptance metrics, call out blockers, and commit to a single critical-path item for the day.
- **Ceremonies:**
  - Sprint Planning (90 min) — scope and capacity alignment.
  - Mid-sprint Review (30 min) — metric health check and risk triage.
  - Sprint Review/Demo (45 min) — follow the demo script to showcase the vertical slice.
  - Retrospective (30 min) — "start/stop/continue" with action owners.
