## Epic 1 — Legal Intake & Triage System (stop being the bottleneck)

1. Implement a single legal intake portal (forms + routing + SLAs).
2. Define request categories: contracts, privacy, product review, disputes, employment, policy.
3. Add mandatory fields: customer, risk tier, deadline, revenue impact, links to docs.
4. Create triage rules: auto-approve low risk, escalate high risk, reject incomplete.
5. Establish response SLAs by category and segment (enterprise vs SMB).
6. Build a “decision authority” map (what Legal decides vs delegates).
7. Create an exceptions registry for off-policy asks (expiry required).
8. Track intake volume and time-to-close; publish monthly.
9. Create playbooks for top 20 request types (standard responses).
10. Automate status updates to requesters (reduce Slack pings).
11. Delete backdoor legal requests via DM—intake or nothing.
