## Epic 7 — Employment Counsel Ops (scale without lawsuits)

1. Standardize employment templates: offer letters, equity grants, invention assignment, confidentiality.
2. Create manager playbooks: performance, discipline, terminations, documentation.
3. Implement case management for employee relations issues (confidential, auditable).
4. Track global employment compliance (EoR, local counsel, benefits, term rules).
5. Implement training: harassment, retaliation, wage/hour basics, documentation discipline.
6. Build layoff/restructure playbook with selection criteria documentation.
7. Enforce offboarding security + legal attestations (return materials, no data retention).
8. Maintain whistleblower intake channel and investigation protocol.
9. Track claims and near-misses; ship systemic fixes.
10. Run annual HR/legal tabletop: complaint + investigation + comms.
11. Delete informal manager handling of high-risk issues.
