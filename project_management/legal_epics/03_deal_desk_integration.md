## Epic 3 — Deal Desk Integration (close faster, promise less)

1. Create a deal desk workflow integrated with CRM (single thread of truth).
2. Define deal risk tiers and required reviews (security, privacy, finance, product).
3. Build pre-approved “give/get” matrix for discounts and term concessions.
4. Implement a standard security addendum and trust packet for procurement.
5. Create a “fast lane” for deals on standard terms with SLA guarantees.
6. Track cycle time drivers (legal, security, customer procurement) and fix root causes.
7. Train Sales on claims discipline and what to escalate.
8. Create a deal Q&A bank and evidence links to avoid rework.
9. Implement deviation tracking and a quarterly “deviation burn-down.”
10. Run weekly deal desk review with decisions logged.
11. Delete bespoke commitments that aren’t technically enforceable.
