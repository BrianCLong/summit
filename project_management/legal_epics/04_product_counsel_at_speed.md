## Epic 4 — Product Counsel at Speed (ship with guardrails, not fear)

1. Define Tier 0/1 product review triggers (data, AI, exports, regulated features).
2. Create checklists for privacy, security, claims, and compliance per feature type.
3. Embed counsel reviews into PRDs and launch checklists (not end-of-sprint panic).
4. Implement “legal design patterns” for common product decisions (consent, retention, audits).
5. Build a policy engine approach to enforce legal constraints in code.
6. Create a “claims library” and gate marketing/UX text through it.
7. Maintain a product risk register with ship dates for mitigations.
8. Run quarterly product legal audits for drift (what shipped vs what policy says).
9. Provide training for PMs and engineers on top legal traps.
10. Create rapid escalation path for high-risk launches (48-hour decisions).
11. Delete late-stage “legal surprises” by shifting left.
