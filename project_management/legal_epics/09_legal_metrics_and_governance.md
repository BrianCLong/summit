## Epic 9 — Legal Metrics & Governance (prove Legal is an execution multiplier)

1. Define Legal KPIs: cycle time, standard-terms %, deviation rate, DSAR SLA, disputes cost.
2. Build dashboards for intake, contracts, matters, and policy exceptions.
3. Set quarterly targets: faster deals, fewer deviations, lower exposure, fewer escalations.
4. Maintain a top-10 legal risk register with mitigations shipped.
5. Run monthly Legal ops review: backlog, bottlenecks, automation opportunities.
6. Publish a monthly Legal update to execs: wins, risks, asks.
7. Track and reduce “legal debt” (stale templates, old policies, contract sprawl).
8. Create a self-serve library for the business (approved language, playbooks, FAQs).
9. Automate repetitive work (NDAs, low-risk DPAs, standard addenda).
10. Reward teams for staying on standard terms and reducing risk.
11. Institutionalize the rule: **Legal scales by systems, not heroics.**
