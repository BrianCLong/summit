## Epic 8 — Policy, Compliance, and Training Engine (lightweight but real)

1. Convert key policies into short, enforced playbooks (security, privacy, comms, AI).
2. Implement policy versioning and change logs (docs-as-code).
3. Require annual training plus role-based refreshers (Sales, Support, Eng).
4. Add just-in-time prompts in workflows (before exports, approvals, marketing claims).
5. Track training completion and comprehension; escalate non-compliance.
6. Implement continuous compliance monitoring for core controls (evidence factory).
7. Maintain an exceptions registry with expirations and mitigating controls.
8. Run quarterly audits of policy adherence and publish findings internally.
9. Tie compliance posture to launch gates for Tier 0 features.
10. Build board-ready compliance reporting and risk register.
11. Delete long policy PDFs no one reads.
