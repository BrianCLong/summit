## Epic 2 — Contract Automation & Template Convergence (standard terms at scale)

1. Move to a CLM system of record with versioned templates and clause library.
2. Standardize MSA/order form/DPA templates (consumer/SMB/enterprise split).
3. Create fallback positions (green/yellow/red) and negotiation playbooks.
4. Implement approval gates for red clauses (LoL, indemnities, audit rights, MFN, exclusives).
5. Add metadata to every contract (term, renewal, caps, deviations, customer tier).
6. Build automated redlining and clause suggestions for common asks.
7. Create self-serve NDAs and low-risk paper for speed.
8. Enforce “no side letters” without GC approval and expiry.
9. Standardize signature authority and e-sign routing.
10. Build renewal/notice automation to prevent silent renewals.
11. Delete legacy templates and “copy last deal” behavior.
