# CompanyOS Initiative Build Plans

This directory captures the full execution playbooks for the eight parallel CompanyOS tickets. Each dossier expands the Jira-ready definitions into end-to-end delivery guidance covering architecture, work breakdown, validation, and operational readiness requirements.

Each individual markdown file documents:

- **Architecture overview** illustrating service interactions, data flows, and policy touch points.
- **Detailed implementation plan** broken into phases with explicit task owners and sequencing.
- **Validation matrix** mapping unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to acceptance criteria.
- **Observability, security, and documentation deliverables** required before rollout.
- **Operational readiness checklist** with go/no-go gates, rollback plans, and training artifacts.

Use these build plans as the authoritative reference when executing the sprint or producing downstream artifacts such as SOPs, playbooks, and runbooks.
