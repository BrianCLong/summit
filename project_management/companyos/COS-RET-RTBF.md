# COS-RET-RTBF — Retention & Right-to-be-Forgotten

## Goal
Enforce data retention tiers and implement a Right-to-be-Forgotten (RTBF) workflow with auditability, ensuring deleted/anonymized data is excluded from restores and access paths respect purpose limitations.

## Key Outcomes
- Tiered retention tagging across entities with scheduled deletion/anonymization jobs.
- RTBF request workflow covering intake, authorization, execution, and signed audit records.
- Purpose enforcement integrated with policy pack to prevent unauthorized resurrection of deleted PII.
- Point-in-time restore verification ensuring tombstoned data remains excluded.

## Architecture Overview
| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Data Catalog | Stores entity metadata including retention tier and purpose tags.
| Retention Scheduler | Orchestrates deletion/anonymization jobs per tier.
| RTBF Service | Handles intake, approval, execution, and audit trail generation.
| Policy Engine | Ensures requests include `{tenant, purpose}` metadata and respect retention policies.
| PITR Validation Job | Confirms restores do not reintroduce deleted PII.
| Audit Ledger | Records RTBF actions with signatures and approvals.

### Workflow Overview
1. Entities tagged with retention tier and purpose upon creation.
2. Scheduler runs daily/weekly jobs to delete/anonymize data past retention deadlines.
3. RTBF request initiated; authorization checks ensure legitimacy; execution anonymizes/deletes records across data stores.
4. Audit ledger captures actions, approvals, and cryptographic signatures.
5. PITR validation job restores snapshot to sandbox to confirm deleted data absent.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 0 — Policy Alignment (Week 1)
- Review retention.json from policy pack; map to data entities and storage systems.
- Align with Legal/Security on RTBF SLAs and audit requirements.

### Phase 1 — Data Tagging & Catalog (Weeks 1-2)
- Update schemas to include `retention_tier` and `purpose` fields; backfill existing data.
- Build catalog views/dashboards for retention coverage and upcoming expirations.

### Phase 2 — Scheduler & Execution (Weeks 2-4)
- Implement retention scheduler (Airflow/Temporal) with tier-specific cadence.
- Develop anonymization/deletion routines per datastore (PostgreSQL, object storage, search indices).
- Integrate purpose enforcement to ensure jobs run under appropriate service identities.

### Phase 3 — RTBF Workflow (Weeks 3-5)
- Build RTBF service with intake API, approval workflow, and execution engine.
- Generate signed audit records (Sigstore) and store in append-only ledger.
- Provide customer communication templates and status tracking.

### Phase 4 — Validation & Restore Checks (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement PITR validation job that restores backups to sandbox and verifies deleted PII absent.
- Run dry-run RTBF on sample subjects; capture metrics and audit evidence.
- Publish runbooks and training materials for support teams.

## Work Breakdown Structure
| Task | Owner | Duration | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Retention policy mapping | Data Eng + Legal | 3d | None |
| Schema updates & backfill | Data Eng | 5d | Policy mapping |
| Scheduler implementation | Data Eng | 5d | Schema updates |
| Datastore routines | Data Eng | 6d | Scheduler |
| RTBF service build | Data Eng + Security | 7d | Routines |
| Audit ledger integration | Data Eng | 3d | RTBF service |
| PITR validation job | Data Eng + SRE | 4d | Audit ledger |
| Runbooks & training | Data Eng | 3d | Validation |

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit**: Retention calculators, anonymization functions, purpose checks.
- **Integration**: Scheduler-to-datastore integration tests ensuring transactions succeed/fail safely.
- **E2E**: RTBF request from intake → execution → audit signature verification.
- **Restore Validation**: Automated PITR job ensuring deleted data absent; fail pipeline if detected.

## Observability & Operations
- Metrics: `retention_jobs_run_total`, `rtbf_requests_total`, `rtbf_completion_seconds`, `pitr_validation_failures_total`.
- Dashboards: Upcoming retention actions, RTBF status by tenant, audit ledger health.
- Alerts: RTBF backlog > SLA, PITR validation failure, retention job errors.

## Security & Compliance
- Enforce least privilege for RTBF execution accounts; require MFA for approvals.
- Store audit ledger in tamper-evident storage with cryptographic signatures.
- Ensure redaction/anonymization routines handle derived datasets (caches, analytics).

## Documentation & Enablement
- Publish RTBF runbook for support/legal teams with contact tree.
- Create customer-facing FAQ summarizing retention tiers and RTBF process.
- Train SRE on PITR validation steps and rollback safeguards.

## Operational Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Retention scheduler runs dry-run reporting without destructive actions.
- [ ] RTBF demo completed with signed audit record reviewed by Legal.
- [ ] PITR validation job executed successfully on staging backup.
- [ ] Runbooks and customer comms reviewed by Legal/Security.

## Dependencies
- Policy Pack `retention.json` available via COS policy fetcher.
- Underlying datastores support selective deletion/anonymization APIs.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Over-deletion**: Dry-run mode with sampling audits before activation.
- **Data resurrection**: Enforce purpose checks and PITR validation before promoting backups.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Retention jobs remove/anonymize data per tier schedule without violating SLAs.
- RTBF requests complete with signed audit records and stakeholder approvals.
- PITR restores do not resurrect deleted PII; validation job reports success.
- Purpose enforcement prevents access to deleted data across services.
