"Populate K8s Secrets (dev)","Create Secret maestro-secrets in maestro-system with: POSTGRES_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, SESSION_SECRET, AUTH0_*, AZURE_*, GOOGLE_*, BASE_URL, OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT. Create PD key in monitoring.",Task,P0,"area:platform,env:dev,security,secrets",owner_dev,"kubectl -n maestro-system get secret maestro-secrets; kubectl -n monitoring get secret pagerduty-routing-key; app reads secrets on restart"
"Populate K8s Secrets (build)","Same as dev but for build namespace; ensure BASE_URL points to build URL.",Task,P0,"area:platform,env:build,security,secrets",owner_build,"Secrets present; pods mount and read them; health passes"
"Create/Update ConfigMap","Apply deploy/maestro/configmap.yaml with LOG_LEVEL, FEATURE_FLAGS, PUBLIC_URL.",Task,P0,"area:platform,config,env:dev",owner_devops,"ConfigMap applied; pods show new env on restart; feature flags visible in logs"
"Verify Argo Rollouts Installed","Install CRDs/controller and kubectl-argo-rollouts plugin; confirm version.",Task,P0,"cd,argo,area:platform",owner_devops,"kubectl get crd rollouts.argoproj.io OK; kubectl-argo-rollouts version OK"
"Verify Monitoring Stack","Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana running; ServiceMonitor CRD available.",Task,P0,"observability,prometheus,grafana",owner_sre,"Pods Ready; CRD monitoring.coreos.com/servicemonitors present; Grafana reachable"
"Verify OTEL Collector","OTLP endpoint reachable from cluster; set OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT env.",Task,P0,"observability,otel",owner_sre,"TCP connect succeeds; traces visible in Jaeger/Grafana Tempo if used"
"Deploy Canary (dev)","Apply deploy/argo/rollout-maestro.yaml, set image to sha-${GITHUB_SHA}; watch canary.",Task,P0,"cd,argo,canary,env:dev",owner_devops,"Canary progresses 10→25→50→100 with analysis passing"
"Health/Readiness Checks","Confirm /healthz and /readyz return 200; /api/version responds.",Task,P0,"sre,healthchecks,env:dev",owner_backend,"Health endpoints green; version returns expected JSON"
"CI/CD Secrets & Vars","Set PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY, COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=true, registry vars, OIDC creds.",Task,P0,"ci,security,cosign,sbom",owner_devops,"Secrets present in GitHub; pipeline runs to completion"
"Pipeline Order Verified","Build → tests → SBOM → cosign sign → push → deploy(dev).",Task,P0,"ci,release,security",owner_devops,"Workflow run shows correct stage order; artifacts attached"
"Branch Protection","Require checks: unit, e2e, sbom, sign, vuln scan.",Task,P0,"compliance,security,ci",owner_devops,"Branch protection rule active; PRs blocked until checks pass"
"Argo Analysis Gating","Prometheus queries for p95 and 5xx rate used for canary gating.",Task,P0,"observability,argo,canary",owner_sre,"Rollout blocked on failing analysis; passes on healthy"
"Dashboards Imported","Grafana dashboards (service overview, rollout, error budget) imported.",Task,P0,"observability,grafana",owner_sre,"Dashboards show live data; error budget panel filled"
"PagerDuty Routing Test","Trigger test alert via Alertmanager API; validate incident in PD.",Task,P0,"incident,alerting,pagerduty",owner_oncall,"PD incident opened; silence/ack flow verified"
"Synthetic + E2E Green","Smoke script hits /healthz,/readyz and a happy-path workflow; CI job runs same.",Task,P0,"testing,smoke,e2e",owner_qe,"Local and CI smoke pass; no 5xx spikes"
"Runbooks R1–R5 Checked In","Rollback/Abort, DB migration roll-fwd/back, OIDC rotation, On-call triage, Canary tuning.",Task,P0,"runbooks,docs,ops",owner_docs,"Runbooks in docs/runbooks, linked from README; reviewed"
"DR & Retention","Backup schedule set; scripts/dr/restore_check.sh passes; retention SQL scheduled.",Task,P0,"dr,backup,retention",owner_sre,"First artifact present; restore_check OK; retention job logs"
