# 117: Confidential Compute Enclave Runner (CCE)

Track: Feature Flags
Branch: feat/cce
Labels: feature-flag, area:infra, area:security, ci:e2e

## Summary
Enable enclave-backed execution for sensitive analytics using SGX/TDX/SEV with remote attestation, sealed outputs, and client SDKs, controlled by CCE_ENABLED.

## Deliverables
- Go service at `/platform/cce` with enclave manager, attestation verifier, sealed storage, and gRPC “run job” API.
- SDKs (TS/Python) to submit enclave jobs; manifests include attestation quotes; model packs for enclave-safe inference.
- UI: “Run in Enclave” toggle, attestation badge, and jQuery proof copy button.

## Constraints
- Default: no network egress from enclaves; KMS (#27) unwrap occurs inside enclave only; region-local TEE selection (SRP #42).
- Feature flag gating via `CCE_ENABLED`.

## DoD / CI Gates
- Attestation test vectors and enclave echo/hash tests.
- Playwright E2E: submit → attest → retrieve sealed result.
- Security checks for allowlisted enclave binaries and manifest validation.

## Open Questions (Tuning)
- First TEE target (SGX vs. TDX/SEV)?
- Allowlists for enclave binaries?

## Parallelization Notes
- Infra-side; enclave jobs isolated with sealed outputs; no runtime coupling to other features.
