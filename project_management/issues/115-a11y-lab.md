# 115: Accessibility & Inclusive UX Lab (A11Y-Lab)

Track: Feature Flags
Branch: feat/a11y-lab
Labels: feature-flag, area:ux, area:accessibility, ci:e2e

## Summary
Establish AAA accessibility lab with automated gates and human review loops, providing tooling, Storybook integration, and runtime overlays under A11Y_LAB_ENABLED.

## Deliverables
- App at `/apps/a11y-lab` with axe-core gates, keyboard trap detector, contrast budgeter, and screen-reader scripts; Storybook a11y panel.
- Playwright + axe integration; focus order maps; text scale and RTL stress tests (ties into #45).
- Runtime "A11y heatmap" overlay toggle for surfacing violations.

## Constraints
- No analytics on content; only UI element IDs; differential privacy guards for UX telemetry (per #96).
- Feature flag gating via `A11Y_LAB_ENABLED`.

## DoD / CI Gates
- Zero critical accessibility violations on app shell enforced in CI.
- Automated gates for axe-core and keyboard traps; manual checklist templates committed.
- Playwright coverage for overlay toggle and stress tests.

## Open Questions (Tuning)
- Minimum contrast ratios beyond WCAG targets?
- Target screen-reader set (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)?

## Parallelization Notes
- UI + CI gates only; no backend coupling.
