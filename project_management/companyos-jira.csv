COS-ID-SCIM-ABAC — OIDC/SCIM + ABAC Enforcement,"Goal: Enforce tenant-scoped ABAC while synchronizing identities through OIDC and SCIM v2.

Scope:
- Deliver OIDC login for console and API clients with tenant context injection.
- Build a SCIM v2 role-to-COS role mapper that projects IdP groups into CompanyOS roles and tenants.
- Apply OPA policy gates on every read/write, attach {tenant, purpose} metadata to requests, and stand up a documented break-glass user rotation.

Implementation Plan:
1. Draft the tenant/purpose ABAC matrix with Security and encode the rules in OPA rego modules supported by unit fixtures.
2. Integrate OIDC libraries, configure token refresh + JWKS caching, and add middleware that derives tenant and purpose claims for downstream services.
3. Stand up the SCIM webhook ingestion worker, map external groups to COS roles, and backfill existing assignments without downtime.
4. Inject purpose metadata within service adapters, enforce OPA decisions at the edge and service layer, and emit structured audit events.
5. Provision a break-glass admin account, automate credential rotation, and document escalation and validation steps.

Telemetry & Ops:
- Emit login success/failure metrics, OPA decision counts, and SCIM sync lag; alert on sustained failures.
- Create dashboards covering denied decisions, drift detection, and break-glass activity.

Documentation & Enablement:
- Update console/API authentication guides, publish the break-glass runbook, and brief on-call on the escalation path.

Tests:
- Unit: ABAC allow/deny vectors across tenant and purpose dimensions.
- Contract: SCIM webhook event → role visible and enforced via OPA.
- E2E: login flow → verify access paths with and without declared purpose.
