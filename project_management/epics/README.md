# IntelGraph GA Core – Epics (Stub)

Note: The exact epic names and branch slugs must match “Section 7” of the PRD. I could not find Section 7 in this repo. Please paste it and I’ll align these stubs and auto-create branches accordingly.

Tracks (owners):

- A: Core Graph
- B: Copilot / RAG
- C: Analytics
- D: Frontend
- E: Policy / Audit
- F: Ops / Cost

Temporary branch naming (to be replaced with Section 7): `type/scope/short-desc` (e.g., `feat/A1-nl-to-cypher`)
