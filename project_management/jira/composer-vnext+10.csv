Epic,FinOps Chargeback & Showback,"Implement detailed, per-tenant cost allocation for all Maestro-managed resources (compute, storage, egress) with self-serve dashboards.","Tenants can view their own detailed spend reports with <24h latency; finance can attribute ≥95% of platform costs.",High,"finops;chargeback;bi",13,,Composer vNext+10
Story,Cost Allocation Tagging & Ingestion,"Implement a consistent tagging strategy; ingest cost data into the Build Lake, joining with Maestro telemetry.","All spawned resources have tenant/project tags; cost data appears in Build Lake within 12h of billing cycle.",High,"finops;telemetry;lake",5,,"FinOps Chargeback & Showback"
Story,Chargeback Dashboard v1,"Build a Grafana dashboard showing spend by tenant, service, and resource type (compute/storage/egress).","Dashboard loads in <5s (warm); tenants can filter by their namespace and a time range (last 7/30/90 days).",High,"finops;grafana;ui",5,,"FinOps Chargeback & Showback"
Epic,Predictive Budgeting & Rightsizing,"Create ML-driven forecasting for tenant budgets and an agent to recommend resource downsizing to cut waste.","Predictive alerts catch ≥60% of overruns a week out; rightsizing PRs are accepted ≥50% of the time.",High,"finops;ml;optimization",13,,Composer vNext+10
Story,Spend Forecast Model v1,"Train a time-series model (e.g., Prophet) on the last 90 days of spend data to predict the next 30 days per tenant.","Model backtesting shows mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) <15%; inference service p99 latency <500ms.",High,"ml;finops;forecasting",8,,"Predictive Budgeting & Rightsizing"
Story,Rightsizing Agent (Shadow Mode),"Agent analyzes p99 usage for CI runners and dev services; logs downsizing/upsizing recommendations without taking action.","Agent identifies ≥10% of fleet as over-provisioned; recommendations are logged with estimated savings.",Medium,"optimization;agent;finops",5,,"Predictive Budgeting & Rightsizing"
Epic,Autonomous Governance Bots,"Develop bots that enforce policy-as-code for security (Policy Drift Bot) and dependency management (Supply Chain Guardian).","≥70% of common policy drifts are auto-remediated; critical CVEs get auto-patch PRs within 24h.",Highest,"governance;security;automation",21,,Composer vNext+10
Story,Policy Drift Bot (OPA-based),"Bot periodically scans cloud resources against an OPA policy bundle and either auto-remediates or files a P1 ticket.","Bot detects and reverts a public S3 bucket within 15 minutes; action is logged to SIEM with audit trail.",High,"security;opa;automation",8,,"Autonomous Governance Bots"
Story,Supply Chain Guardian Bot,"Bot monitors the org-wide provenance graph; on new CVE/license issue, finds all affected repos and opens fix PRs.","Bot opens PRs to patch a new critical CVE in a transitive dependency across ≥5 repos within 24h of vulnerability publication.",Highest,"security;supply-chain;provenance",8,,"Autonomous Governance Bots"
Story,Guardian/Drift Bot PR/Ticket Integration,"Integrate bots with Jira and GitHub to file detailed tickets and create well-documented PRs assigned to OWNERS.","Generated PRs include link to CVE, risk score, and passing pre-commit checks; tickets have severity and owner.",Medium,"automation;dx;jira",5,,"Autonomous Governance Bots"
Epic,Developer Experience & Onboarding,"Streamline new project creation with blessed templates (Golden Paths) and a self-service UI for new teams to get started.","New project creation time from request to first green build is < 1 hour; manual setup steps are reduced by ≥90%.",High,"dx;onboarding;automation",8,,Composer vNext+10
Story,Golden Path Template Repo,"Create a meta-repo containing templates for common service types (e.g., go-service, python-ml-service) with blessed config.","`maestro init --template go-service` scaffolds a new repo that passes all CI and security gates on first push.",High,"dx;scaffolding",3,,"Developer Experience & Onboarding"
Story,Self-Service Tenant Onboarding UI,"A React form for new teams to request a namespace, with a simple backend workflow for manager approval and provisioning.","End-to-end flow (request -> approval -> provisioned) takes <15 minutes of wall-clock time; user gets a confirmation email.",Medium,"onboarding;ui;workflow",5,,"Developer Experience & Onboarding"
