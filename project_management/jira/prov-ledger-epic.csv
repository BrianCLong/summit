IG,Epic,Provenance & Claim Ledger (Service),"Stateless API + append-only store to register evidence, parse claims, compute contradiction graphs, and emit a verifiable export manifest (hash tree + transform chain). Repo: services/prov-ledger/ (nothing outside). Milestones: M1 Contracts & fixtures; M2 Core write/read paths; M3 Contradiction graph; M4 Export manifest + CLI verifier; M5 Perf hardening & SLOs.",Provenance & Claim Ledger (Service),,ledger;provenance;claims;contracts,Ledger,,34,"API & event fixtures stable; contract tests pass. Golden E2E: ingest->resolve->report including manifest verification. p95 latency targets met on seeded dataset. No edits beyond services/prov-ledger/*.",High,
