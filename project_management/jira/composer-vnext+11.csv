Epic,IDP & Service Catalog,"Evolve Maestro into a true IDP with a software catalog for discovery and self-service actions for operational tasks.","≥50 services are registered; devs can trigger actions like 'deploy' or 'run tests' directly from the catalog UI.",Highest,"idp;devex;catalog",21,,Composer vNext+11
Story,Catalog Ingester & UI,"Build a system that finds and parses catalog-info.yaml files from repos and displays them in a searchable UI.","UI can search by owner, tag, or service name; data is refreshed within 5 minutes of a git push.",High,"idp;catalog;ui",8,,"IDP & Service Catalog"
Story,Self-Service Action Framework,"Create a framework for defining actions that can be triggered from the catalog, backed by Maestro workflows.","Define and implement 3 actions (e.g., 'run-perf-test', 'deploy-to-staging', 'view-security-scan') that can be run by devs.",High,"idp;automation;workflow",8,,"IDP & Service Catalog"
Story,Tech Radar & Scorecards,"Automatically generate a Tech Radar and repo quality scorecards within the IDP based on build telemetry and provenance data.","Tech Radar correctly classifies technologies based on org standards; scorecards show metrics like test coverage and CI speed.",Medium,"idp;governance;metrics",5,,"IDP & Service Catalog"
Epic,AI Co-pilot (Generative),"Introduce an AI Co-pilot to assist developers by auto-generating unit tests and suggesting fixes for common bugs.","Co-pilot increases test coverage on new code by ≥30% and correctly suggests fixes for ≥60% of targeted bug patterns.",Highest,"ai;devex;generative-ai",21,,Composer vNext+11
Story,AI Co-pilot: Test Generation,"For a given PR, the co-pilot analyzes changed files and suggests missing unit tests, posting them as a PR comment.","Generated tests for Go/Python increase line coverage and are accepted by developers ≥70% of the time.",High,"ai;testing;ci",8,,"AI Co-pilot (Generative)"
Story,AI Co-pilot: Bug Fix Suggestions,"For common, pattern-based bugs (e.g., Java NPEs), the co-pilot analyzes failure logs and code to suggest a patch.","For 2 targeted Java NPE patterns, the co-pilot provides a valid patch suggestion in the build logs or a PR comment.",High,"ai;debugging;automation",8,,"AI Co-pilot (Generative)"
Story,Co-pilot Model Fine-Tuning & Integration,"Fine-tune a code-generation LLM on internal codebases; build the infrastructure to serve suggestions via a secure API.","Model inference p95 latency is <3s; API is secured and has rate limits; feedback loop is in place to capture suggestion quality.",Medium,"ai;mlops;llm",5,,"AI Co-pilot (Generative)"
Epic,Advanced Graph & Platform Intelligence,"Leverage the cross-repo provenance graph to provide deep, actionable insights for architects and developers.","New queries for finding experts and visualizing blast radius are available in the UI and return results in <2s.",High,"provenance;graph;analytics",8,,Composer vNext+11
Story,Advanced Provenance Queries,"Implement and expose API/UI queries for 'find expert for file X', 'find code duplication', and 'show blast radius for library Y'.","Queries are accurate and results include links to repos, owners, and relevant code lines.",High,"graph;analytics;api",5,,"Advanced Graph & Platform Intelligence"
Task,Pilot Rollout & Documentation,"Onboard 3 pilot teams to the new IDP and AI features, gather feedback, and write user-facing documentation.","Documentation is published; a feedback summary report is created with action items for vNext+12.",Medium,"devex;release",3,,"IDP & Service Catalog"
