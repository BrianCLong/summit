Epic,Enterprise Guardrails (RBAC, SLOs, Audit),"Implement critical enterprise features: granular, policy-based access control, declarative SLOs, and a signed audit trail.","RBAC policies are 100% code; SLOs can be managed for any service; audit trail is searchable in SIEM and tamper-evident.",Highest,"enterprise;security;rbac;slo",21,,Composer vNext+12
Story,RBAC Policy Engine,"Implement an ABAC/RBAC engine (e.g., using OPA) to govern all Maestro API calls and self-service actions.","Access policies are defined in Rego; a PR to change a policy requires senior approval; default-deny is enforced.",High,"rbac;security;opa",8,,"Enterprise Guardrails (RBAC, SLOs, Audit)"
Story,Declarative SLO Framework,"Allow teams to define SLOs (latency, availability) for their services in a YAML file; Maestro tracks burn-down and alerts.","SLOs are visible in the IDP; alerts are sent to Slack/PagerDuty when error budget burn rate exceeds thresholds.",High,"slo;monitoring;metrics",8,,"Enterprise Guardrails (RBAC, SLOs, Audit)"
Story,Signed Audit Trail to SIEM,"Cryptographically sign all audit logs for sensitive actions before exporting them to the company's SIEM.","Log signature can be independently verified; SIEM dashboard is created to review all privileged actions.",Medium,"audit;security;siem",5,,"Enterprise Guardrails (RBAC, SLOs, Audit)"
Epic,Plugin App Store & Ecosystem,"Create a central, secure marketplace within Maestro for discovering, installing, and managing trusted extensions.","Users can browse and manage plugins; all plugins are signed and verified; basic usage metering is in place.",High,"plugins;ecosystem;app-store",13,,Composer vNext+12
Story,App Store UI,"Build a UI within the IDP that lists available plugins with descriptions, owners, and version history.","UI allows users to enable/disable plugins for their tenant (with permissions); UI shows installation status.",High,"plugins;ui;idp",5,,"Plugin App Store & Ecosystem"
Story,Plugin Manifest & Verification,"Define a 'plugin-manifest.json' standard; enforce that all loaded plugins are signed and match a valid manifest.","Maestro refuses to load any unsigned plugin or one with a missing/invalid manifest; error is logged for security.",High,"plugins;security;signing",5,,"Plugin App Store & Ecosystem"
Story,Plugin Usage Metering,"For plugins with a 'cost' attribute, meter their usage (e.g., API calls, compute time) and log it to the Build Lake.","Cost data is joined with tenant info, making it available for FinOps chargeback reports.",Medium,"plugins;finops;metering",3,,"Plugin App Store & Ecosystem"
Story,PR Change Risk Assessment,"Develop a model that scores every PR for risk based on code churn, file sensitivity, blast radius, and author history.","Risk score (0-100) is displayed on the PR; scores for post-deploy incidents are, on average, 2x higher than for safe changes.",Medium,"ai;risk;ci",5,
