## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to our team directly:

- **Email**: security@summit.dev
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in this repository
- **For urgent P0 security issues**: Include "[P0-SECURITY]" in the subject line

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** assessment
4. **Suggested fix** (if known)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**:
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 1 week
  - Medium: 2 weeks
  - Low: Next release cycle

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** to the repository
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Follow least privilege** principles
4. **Keep dependencies updated**
5. **Run security scans** locally before submitting PRs

### For Deployments

1. **Enable Release Captain** for all production deployments
2. **Use environment-specific secrets** management
3. **Monitor security alerts** in GitHub
4. **Regular security audits** with `npm audit`
5. **Implement proper access controls**

## Secret Rotation Procedures

If you accidentally commit a secret or suspect a secret has been compromised:

### Immediate Actions (< 15 minutes)

1. **Revoke the compromised secret** immediately
2. **Generate a new secret** with the same permissions
3. **Update the secret** in all deployment environments
4. **Test the application** to ensure it's still functional

### Follow-up Actions (< 1 hour)

1. **Create an incident issue** using the template:
   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "ðŸš¨ Secret Rotation: [SECRET_TYPE]" \
     --body "Secret compromised and rotated. Details in private channel." \
     --label "security,incident,secret-rotation"
   ```

2. **Notify the security team** via secure channel
3. **Review access logs** for any unauthorized usage
4. **Update documentation** with new secret references

### Git History Cleanup

```bash
# Remove secret from git history (use with caution)
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/file/with/secret' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Alternative: Use BFG Repo Cleaner
java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files secret-file.txt
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

## Security Tools and Automation

helm lint charts/*/

# Test OPA policies
opa test .github/policies/
```
