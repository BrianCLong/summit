# 📑 Provisional Patent Pack + Integration Cut‑Plan
*Council of Spies & Strategists — Markus Wolf, Chair*

> Scope: Provisional abstracts + representative claims for core inventions across **Volumes I–IV**, followed by a repo‑ready **Integration Cut‑Plan** (services, APIs, storage schemas, proof formats, CI gates). No repetition from prior volumes; ethical constraints enforced.

---
## Part A — Provisional Patent Pack (Abstracts + Representative Claims)
> Drafted for provisional filing. Each entry includes a *concise abstract*, *one independent claim*, and *selected dependent claims*. Final lawyering to refine claims breadth and jurisdictional language.

### 1) Counterfactual Proof Cartridges (CPC)
**Abstract.** A packaging format for forecasts and courses‑of‑action that binds outputs to a compact **counterfactual proof sketch** indicating minimal assumption sets whose alteration flips the outcome. The cartridge carries provenance, solver breadcrumbs, and verifiable sensitivity ranges.
**Independent Claim.** A method for generating a counterfactual package comprising: (i) deriving a causal graph over input features; (ii) computing a minimal hitting set of assumption literals whose inversion changes a decision; (iii) encoding the set, solver certificates, and provenance digests into a signed cartridge; and (iv) validating the cartridge by replay under constrained perturbations.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) wherein validation employs SMT proofs with bounded regret guarantees; (b) wherein the cartridge caches reusable proof fragments keyed by content‑defined chunking; (c) wherein exports include audience‑scoped redactions without breaking verification.

### 2) Policy‑Sealed Computation (PSC)
**Abstract.** A compute pipeline that enforces data‑use policies **cryptographically** by compiling policy to bytecode, executing within attested TEEs, and sealing inputs/outputs via functional encryption so that any execution violating policy is unrepresentable.
**Independent Claim.** A system comprising: a policy compiler producing executable constraints; a TEE runtime attesting code identity; and a functional encryption layer sealing IO such that only executions satisfying the compiled policy yield decryptable outputs; with an external zero‑knowledge attestation of compliance.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) combined FE+TEE+ZK handshake with hardware‑backed entropy; (b) revocation that cryptographically expires derived artifacts; (c) ombuds constraints injected as unforgeable guard predicates.

### 3) Proof‑of‑Non‑Collection (PNC)
**Abstract.** Techniques to **prove the absence** of access: negative‑evidence commitments over data catalogs, with Merkle exclusions and range proofs to show a query or agent avoided disallowed tenants/fields/selectors within stated bounds.
**Independent Claim.** A method issuing a non‑collection proof by: (i) committing to a namespace index; (ii) logging access transcripts; (iii) generating set‑exclusion proofs that transcripts do not intersect prohibited selectors; and (iv) publishing a verifier‑checkable certificate with statistical leakage bounds.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) differential‑privacy budgeting of transcript disclosure; (b) rolling window proofs summarized as STARK‑style digests; (c) watchdog alerts on proof gaps.

### 4) Semantic Delta Networks (SDN)
**Abstract.** A knowledge‑sync protocol that transmits **meaningful deltas** rather than documents: causal fingerprints, motif changes, and stance flips canonicalized for low‑bandwidth, conflict‑free merges across federations and edge.
**Independent Claim.** A network protocol encoding graph‑state differences as canonical causal fingerprints, streaming only semantic deltas and reconstructing target states via CRDT‑compatible merges with proof‑attached lineage.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) delta prioritization by decision impact; (b) downstream revocation on covenant expiry; (c) dual path loss‑y previews and loss‑less replay.

### 5) Introspective Weight Surgery (IWS)
**Abstract.** Live hot‑patching of model submodules using mechanistic probes that localize failure modes, perform **subspace edits** with bounded‑impact certificates, and emit a “Surgery Receipt” for audit and rollback.
**Independent Claim.** A method for bounded model editing comprising probe‑guided localization, constrained subspace optimization, impact certification against safety suites, and signed receipts linking edits to observed defect reduction.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) safety proofs expressed as PAC‑Bayes bounds; (b) edit scopes guarded by policy bytecode; (c) multi‑model propagation via transfer‑surgery graphs.

### 6) Generative Watermarks — Dual Entropy (GW‑DE)
**Abstract.** Watermarking that fuses content‑defined randomness with model‑state entropy to resist laundering and cross‑model transfer, with detectors robust to compression and paraphrase.
**Independent Claim.** A watermark encoder drawing bits from (i) content hash streams and (ii) internal model state entropy, embedding a composite signal detectable post‑transform, with hypothesis testing calibrated to bounded false‑positive rates.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) resilience certificates across codec families; (b) laundering path classifiers trained on synthetic attacks; (c) watermark key rotation without content drift.

### 7) Zero‑Knowledge Early‑Warning Exchange (ZKEWX)
**Abstract.** Multi‑party anomaly sharing as **claims not data**, reconciling via ZK set/range/correlation proofs and backstopped by an insurance pool to settle false‑positive externalities.
**Independent Claim.** A federated protocol in which participants publish anomaly commitments and exchange zero‑knowledge correlation proofs over sliding windows, triggering alerts only upon multi‑party corroboration thresholds.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) tunable sensitivity by role; (b) proof aggregation via recursive SNARKs; (c) economic settlement smart‑contracts for misfires.

### 8) Liaison Covenants & Revocation Oracles (LCRO)
**Abstract.** Time‑boxed **trust covenants** with programmable revocation that trace and expire downstream derivatives; verifiers replay expiry proofs against dependency graphs.
**Independent Claim.** A covenant registry issuing signed permits with expiry policies, a dependency tracer linking derived artifacts, and a revocation oracle that propagates expiries, producing verifier‑checkable revocation proofs.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) partial revocation with audience‑scoped redaction; (b) escrowed collaboration spaces with auto‑wipe; (c) audit logs resistant to tampering via append‑only proofs.

### 9) Dialectic Co‑Agents & Decision Debate Record (DCQ/DDR)
**Abstract.** Paired adversarial agents that iterate arguments/counter‑arguments until **coverage and novelty** converge, emitting an immutable **Decision Debate Record** with stance, evidence, and dissent metrics.
**Independent Claim.** A system spawning opposing reasoners whose outputs are scored for coverage and novelty; termination occurs on threshold satisfaction; artifacts and metrics are sealed into a signed DDR for replay.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) PAC‑style stopping rules; (b) dissent injection from human participants; (c) policy‑bound tool access.

### 10) Ombuds Autonomy Controller + Proof‑of‑Purpose (OAC/PoP)
**Abstract.** Hard‑constraints from ombuds compiled to enforceable bytecode; all data/claims carry **purpose tags** with **use‑decay**. Agents cannot breach constraints; expired purpose auto‑locks derivatives and triggers revocation.
**Independent Claim.** A governance pipeline compiling constraints and purpose clocks into enforceable runtime guards; exports succeed iff live constraints and purposes are satisfied, evidenced by machine‑verifiable attestations.
**Dependent Claims.** (a) exception proofs with quorum signatures; (b) purpose‑aware scheduling; (c) civil‑harm meters as preconditions.
