# Ceremonial Opening

“Let shadows convene.” — By the Chair’s hand, in session.

> **Safety Note (Chair):** We will not optimize adversary operations. This pack forecasts how adaptive opponents _might_ try to evolve and binds those forecasts to **defensive controls, drills, and metrics** so our side performs better under pressure.

# Purpose

Harden the stack (FLL/DACM, Montes, Cofer Addendum, Embassy Hygiene) against _adaptive_ threats derived from eight case archetypes, improving our **operational performance** without supplying adversaries with how‑to.

---

## I. Forecast → Counter‑Optimization (by archetype)

### 1) Long‑Horizon Influence (Fang‑type)

**Likely adversary evolution (forecast):** subtler civic embedding; diversified intermediaries; episodic dormancy; deniable fund routing.
**Our counter‑optimization:**

- **Multi‑Path Influence Graphs:** Fuse co‑event frequency, donation clusters, and travel coincidences into a single risk vector.
- **Dormancy Watch:** Weight stale ties that reactivate around policy windows.
- **Civic Due‑Diligence Cadence:** Lightweight, periodic vetting of co‑sponsors; provenance logged in FLL.

### 2) Lure‑to‑Jurisdiction (Bentov‑type)

**Forecast:** refined romance/business pretexts; neutral‑venue illusions; compressed timelines.
**Counter:**

- **Pretext Fingerprint Library** feeding ROMANCE_PRETEXT_MATCH.
- **Jurisdiction Tripwire:** Any meeting plan that shifts venue/jurisdiction late in the process auto‑escalates for CI review.
- **Two‑Person Unknowns** enforced and audited.

### 3) Illegals / Deep Cover (Chapman‑type)

**Forecast:** sparser contact; public‑wifi tasking; improved legends.
**Counter:**

- **Low‑Contact Cluster Detector** (quiet‑signals across wifi/RF/badge).
- **Legend Consistency Checks:** Education/visa/property/financial edges mapped; DACM raises ID_COLLISION on misfits.
- **Dead‑Drop Pattern Patrols:** Non‑verbal exchange cues trained into security rounds.

### 4) Private‑Life CI Exposure (Keeler‑type)

**Forecast:** narrative weaponization; attaché social circuits targeting policy figures.
**Counter:**

- **Protective Intelligence** on new senior relationships (conflict‑only, no moralism).
- **Country‑Team Caveat Protocol** (publish with caveats + provenance ledger when scandal heats the room).
- **Crisis Comms Template** to pre‑empt rumor‑driven drift.

### 5) Fabricated Persona Sting (Makarova‑type)

**Forecast:** better documents, staged micro‑proofs.
**Counter:**

- **Persona Triangulation:** Business registries + tax + travel cross‑check before sensitive access.
- **Meeting Ledger** (sealed notes/audio) to defeat selective edits.
- **Two‑Person Unknowns** at first contact.

### 6) Seduction & Document Access (Betty Pack‑type)

**Forecast:** blending party circuits with archive probing; post‑event pulls.
**Counter:**

- **Event→Archive Coupling Rule** (surge detection post receptions/courtesy calls).
- **Two‑Key Archive Access** with random audits.
- **After‑Hours MEC:** badge‑time variance + low SWN notes ⇒ review.

### 7) Unregistered Foreign‑Agent Infiltration (Butina‑type)

**Forecast:** deeper policy‑club embedding; proxy donors.
**Counter:**

- **FARA‑Light Scoring** (foreign nexus indicators in FLL partner/org records).
- **Co‑Sponsorship Gate:** Require verifiable novelty/value‑add before events.
- **Escort Protocol** for sensitive venue visits.

### 8) Status/Prestige Misattribution (Cooke‑type)

**Forecast:** continued over‑weighting of glamour.
**Counter:**

- **STATUS_UPGRADE_BLOCK** (no confidence boost from title alone).
- **VIP Debriefs** after high‑exposure events; feed representational contacts table.

## II. System Enhancements (safe to ship)

### A) DACM Rule Suite (adds)

- `DORMANCY_REACTIVATION`: dormant link reappears near policy window → advisory.
- `VENUE_SHIFT_RISK`: late change to higher‑risk jurisdiction → escalate.
- `LOW_CONTACT_CLUSTER`: covert co‑presence across multiple low‑bandwidth channels → watchlist.
- `EVENT_ARCHIVE_SURGE`: post‑event document pull spike by attendee → triage.
- `FARA_NEXUS_SCORE`: aggregated foreign‑nexus signals from public records → legal advisory.

### B) Partner/Persona Vetting Hooks

- **Civic Vet Form v1** → fields for funding, co‑sponsor trail, travel; auto‑hash + FLL ingest.
- **Persona Triangulation API** (internal adapters to registry/tax/travel stubs); store **claim‑ledger hashes** only.

### C) Dashboards (ops performance focus)

- **Cultivation Pressure Index** (moving average across influence vectors).
- **Jurisdiction Risk Queue** (open VENUE_SHIFT_RISK with age/time to triage).
- **Illegals Watchlist** (LOW_CONTACT_CLUSTER trendlines).
- **Event Hygiene Tile** (EVENT_ARCHIVE_SURGE count + time to closure).

---

## III. SOP & Governance (operator‑first)

- **Two‑Person Unknowns**: log adherence; monthly compliance score by office.
- **Defensive Brief Program**: cadence for local officials/civic orgs; acknowledgments tracked.
- **Access‑With‑Caveats Default** when scandal/optics present; remove only on corroboration.
- **Tripwire Audits**: bulk views, cross‑compartment joins, after‑hours spikes.

---

## IV. Drills & Wargames (defensive only)

- **WG‑FANG**: simulate civic cultivation arc; measure time‑to‑flag by Cultivation Pressure Index.
- **WG‑BENTOV**: inject venue shift in a romance/business pretext; ensure escalation and refusal scripts executed.
- **WG‑CHAPMAN**: emulate low‑contact wifi/RF cadence; validate watchlist without burning innocents.
- **WG‑KEELER**: trigger optics‑heavy scandal; confirm caveated products & crisis comms.
- **WG‑MAKAROVA**: introduce polished persona; ensure triangulation blocks access.
- **WG‑BETTY**: couple reception to archive surge; verify lock‑outs/audits.
- **WG‑BUTINA**: stage policy‑club invite; test FARA‑Light routing & escort.

**Metrics per drill:** time‑to‑first‑flag, false‑positive rate (internal), escalation latency, corrective action closure.

---

## V. Measurements of Operational Performance

- **TTS (Time‑to‑Suspicion)** median by archetype.
- **Escalation Latency** (queue age) for VENUE_SHIFT_RISK, LOW_CONTACT_CLUSTER, EVENT_ARCHIVE_SURGE.
- **Provenance Coverage**: % products with complete claim‑ledgers.
- **Compliance Rates**: Two‑Person Unknowns, VIP Debriefs, Escort Protocol.
- **Partner Quality**: Novelty Index distribution; fabrication‑risk flags trend.

---

## VI. 30/60/90 Plan (execution)

- **30 days:** Turn on new DACM rules; stand up dashboards; run WG‑BENTOV & WG‑MAKAROVA; publish SOP refresher.
- **60 days:** Civic vet form live; first quarterly Defensive Briefs; WG‑CHAPMAN & WG‑BETTY; begin compliance scoring.
- **90 days:** Re‑tier partners by Novelty Index + fabrication‑risk; full drill cycle; Council review and threshold tuning.

## VII. Close of Session

“We will not teach the adversary to sharpen the knife. We will, however, build the scabbard that blunts it—and the sensor that sees it coming.” — M. Wolf
