- **Alerting:** Prometheus AlertManager with PagerDuty integration
- **Tracing:** Distributed tracing with correlation ID propagation
- **Metrics:** Business, application, and infrastructure metrics collection
- **Logging:** Structured logging with request correlation

### Disaster Recovery Capabilities

- **Automated Backups:** PostgreSQL WAL-E, Neo4j dumps, Redis persistence
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** WAL replay with 30-second granularity
- **Backup Verification:** Automated integrity checks with green/red metrics
- **Recovery Automation:** Scripted restoration with RTO/RPO validation
