# üéØ Maestro Conductor ‚Äî GA Sign‚ÄëOff Packet

**Release ID:** `v2025.10.07`\
**Release Date:** 2025‚Äë10‚Äë07 (America/Denver)\
**Repository:** `BrianCLong/summit`\
**Branch:** `release-artifact-verification-system`\
**Prepared by:** IntelGraph Maestro Conductor (MC)

---

## 1) Executive Summary (One Screen)

**Goal:** Ship Maestro Conductor GA with verifiable, reproducible release artifacts (manifest, attestation, evidence) wired into CI/CD and GitHub Releases.

**Scope (Delivered):**

- Release manifest & attestation generators; integrity verifier; GA validation script; Makefile shortcuts.
- GitHub workflow on tag push ‚Üí builds, verifies, uploads assets to the Release.
- Evidence bundle (SLO + compliance) attached; public GA announcement prepared.

**Non‚ÄëGoals (post‚ÄëGA):** Multi‚Äëregion DR drills; data residency migrations; phase‚Äënext connectors; privacy automation at scale.

**Constraints:** Org SLOs & cost guardrails enforced; provenance on by default; reproducible builds; audit‚Äëready.

**Assumptions:** Tag `v2025.10.07` is the GA cut; evidence reflects current SLO/error‚Äëbudget; dependencies locked for deterministic hashes.

**Risks & Mitigations:**

- Supply‚Äëchain drift ‚Üí frozen locks + hash pinning; verify gate.
- Post‚Äëupload tamper ‚Üí manifest verification + checksums; ready for cosign/keyless.
- Cost overrun during fan‚Äëout ‚Üí budget alerts at 80% threshold.

**Definition of Done:** Artifacts verified & uploaded; announcement staged; validation passed; rollback plan documented.

## 3) Artifacts (Reproducible & Verifiable)

| Type        | Path                                          | Purpose                                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manifest    | `dist/release-manifest-v2025.10.07.yaml`      | Canonical listing of artifacts with SHA256, source commits, build env metadata |
| Attestation | `dist/release-attestation-v2025.10.07.jsonld` | JSON‚ÄëLD verifiable credential describing provenance                            |
| Evidence    | `dist/evidence-v0.3.2-mc-nightly.json`        | SLO & compliance snapshot + verification results                               |

**Generation & Validation Commands**

```bash
npm run release:manifest   # Generate manifest
npm run release:attest     # Generate attestation
npm run release:verify     # Validate manifest hashes vs. artifacts
./scripts/validate-ga.sh   # End‚Äëto‚Äëend GA validation
```

---

## 4) CI/CD Wiring

- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml` ‚Üí trigger on tag push.
- **Outputs:** Manifest, attestation, evidence uploaded to the GitHub Release.
- **Convenience:** `Makefile` one‚Äëliners; npm scripts: `release:manifest`, `release:attest`, `release:verify`.

---

## 5) Org Defaults & SLO Guardrails (Attested)

- **GraphQL Gateway:** Reads p95 ‚â§ 350 ms / Writes p95 ‚â§ 700 ms; 99.9% monthly availability.
- **Neo4j Ops:** 1‚Äëhop p95 ‚â§ 300 ms; 2‚Äì3 hop p95 ‚â§ 1200 ms.
- **Ingest:** ‚â• 1,000 events/s per pod; p95 pre‚Äëstorage processing ‚â§ 100 ms.
- **Cost:** Dev ‚â§ \$1k/mo; Staging ‚â§ \$3k/mo; Prod ‚â§ \$18k/mo (LLM ‚â§ \$5k/mo; alert at 80%).
- **MC Behavior:** SLO gates in CI; error‚Äëbudget + cost burn alerts auto‚Äëopen issues.

---

## 6) Security ¬∑ Privacy ¬∑ Provenance

- **Integrity:** SHA256 for all critical artifacts; verification step is a release gate.
- **Provenance:** Commit SHAs embedded; JSON‚ÄëLD VC attestation; cosign/keyless **ready**.
- **Privacy/Policy Seeds:** OIDC + JWT; ABAC/OPA; field‚Äëlevel encryption for sensitive attributes; retention defaults (standard‚Äë365d, PII short‚Äë30d unless legal‚Äëhold).
- **Auditability:** Immutable provenance ledger; export manifest format compatible with evidence bundle.

---

## 7) Rollback / Backout Plan

1. Freeze promotions; halt new tag deployments.
2. Repoint ‚ÄúLatest‚Äù to prior stable tag; revoke GA tag alias if used.
3. Publish `*-revoked.yaml` with reason/CVE/ticket; mark Release as retracted in notes.
4. Disable promote step via `RELEASE_PROMOTE=false` in CI.
5. Cut hotfix branch `hotfix/<issue>` ‚Üí tag `vYYYY.MM.DD+hotfix.N`; run full verification chain.
6. Issue comms + post‚Äëmortem; attach updated evidence to the corrective Release.

| AC‚Äë3 | CI workflow attaches artifacts to Release on tag push     | Workflow logs show successful uploads; hashes match                   |
| AC‚Äë4 | Evidence bundle contains SLO/compliance snapshots         | Parse `dist/evidence-*.json`; assert required sections present & PASS |
| AC‚Äë5 | Docs exist (announcement + runbooks)                      | Files resolvable in repo under `docs/releases/`                       |

## 13) Final Hardening (Locked)

### 13.1 Immutable & Visible Release

- Marked `v2025.10.07` as **Latest** with public summary.
- GitHub Release created with full documentation and attached artifacts.

### 13.2 Nightly Verification Workflow

- File: `./.github/workflows/nightly-verify.yml`
- Schedule: **04:17 UTC** daily (**23:17 America/Chicago** while on DST).
- Scope: Verifies **latest GA tag** with strict mode + SHA assertions; supports **workflow_dispatch** for manual runs.

### 13.3 Tag Protection Ruleset

- File: `./ops/tag-protection-ruleset.json`
- Effect: Prevents **force-push** and **deletion** to release tags; enforces immutability.
- Example pattern: `^v.*` (tune to `^v\d{4}\.\d{2}\.\d{2}.*$` for date-stamped tags).

### 13.4 GA Health Dashboard (Grafana)

- File: `./ops/grafana/ga-health-dashboard.json`
- Panels: Release status, nightly verification results, artifact count, deployed components, CI queue depth, latency SLOs.
- Use: Attach alerts for verification failures, missing evidence files, or drift.

### 13.5 Comprehensive Operations Runbook

- File: `./RUNBOOK.md`
- Includes: Rollback quick-card, post-GA watch procedures, incident response, maintenance procedures, support contacts.

---

## 14) Post‚ÄëGA Watch (First 7 Days)

1. **Track Metrics:** Verification pass rate, latency, CI queue depth in Grafana.
2. **Alerting:** Enable alerts on verification failures, missing evidence files, and drift detection.
3. **Restore Drill:** Rehydrate from release artifacts into a clean host; record **time-to-green** and document deviations.

---

## 15) Final Security Recommendations

1. **Tag Protection:** Enforce repository rules for tags matching `v*` (no force-delete, no moving).
2. **Actions Retention:** Set Actions artifact retention ‚â• audit window length.
3. **Fine-Grained Token:** Scope orchestration token to a single repo with least-privilege permissions.
