      question: |
        Analyze this network graph and identify any notable patterns or hidden
        connections. Are there any findings that suggest coordinated activity or
        relationships that warrant further investigation?

      Evaluate this graph analysis on the following dimensions:

      **Expected Key Finding:**
      Three former StartupX colleagues (Alice, Bob, Carol) joined three different
      companies in early 2023, and the same investor (Eve) subsequently invested
      in all three companies. This pattern suggests potential coordination.

      **Scoring Dimensions:**

      1. **Pattern Recognition** (0-1): Did they identify the core pattern
         (ex-colleagues → new companies → same investor)?

      2. **Timeline Analysis** (0-1): Did they note the suspicious timing
         (sequential company joins followed by sequential investments)?

      3. **Inference Quality** (0-1): Did they draw reasonable conclusions about
         what this pattern might indicate?

      4. **Evidence Synthesis** (0-1): Did they connect multiple data points
         (relationships, timeline, investments) to build their case?

      5. **Analytical Rigor** (0-1): Did they consider alternative explanations
         and avoid jumping to conclusions?

      Score generously if they identified the key pattern, even if not all details.
      Score harshly if they missed the obvious connection pattern entirely.

rubric:
  guidance: |
    The key insight is recognizing that three former colleagues from StartupX
    all joined different companies within ~2 months, and then the same investor
    invested in all three companies within ~3 months. This pattern is statistically
    unlikely to be coincidental and warrants investigation.

    Strong answers should:
    1. Identify the ex-colleague cluster (Alice, Bob, Carol from StartupX)
    2. Note the timing of their new positions (Jan-Mar 2023)
    3. Identify that one investor (Eve) funded all three companies
    4. Note the timing of investments (Jun-Aug 2023)
    5. Infer this suggests possible coordination or insider information

        ## Notable Pattern: Coordinated Network Activity

        ### Key Finding
        Three former colleagues from StartupX (Alice Chen, Bob Smith, Carol Wang)
        joined three separate companies (TechCorp, DataSys, CloudNet) in quick
        succession (Jan-Mar 2023), and the same investor (Eve Martinez/InvestCo)
        subsequently invested in all three companies (Jun-Aug 2023).

        ### Timeline Analysis
        - **2020-2022**: Alice, Bob, and Carol work together at StartupX
        - **Jan-Mar 2023**: All three join different companies within 2 months
          - Alice → TechCorp (Jan 15)
          - Bob → DataSys (Feb 20)
          - Carol → CloudNet (Mar 10)
        - **Jun-Aug 2023**: Eve invests in all three companies within 3 months
          - TechCorp: $5M (Jun 1)
          - DataSys: $3M (Jul 15)
          - CloudNet: $4M (Aug 20)

        ### Inference
        This pattern suggests several possibilities:
        1. **Coordinated spin-out**: Former colleagues may have coordinated to
           start or join related ventures with pre-arranged funding
        2. **Investor relationship**: Eve may have had prior relationship with
           the StartupX team and followed them to new ventures
        3. **Strategic network**: Could indicate a planned portfolio approach
           to a specific market segment

        ### Recommendation
        Further investigation warranted to:
        - Examine relationship between the three companies (competitors? partners?)
        - Investigate Eve's prior relationship with StartupX team
        - Review if the companies are in related market segments
        - Check if there are any technology transfers or IP considerations
        - Determine if this represents a legitimate investment thesis or
          potential insider coordination

        ### Risk Assessment
        **Medium-High**: Pattern is statistically unusual and timing is suspicious,
        but could have legitimate explanation (e.g., investor follows talented team).
