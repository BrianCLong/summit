# Sprint Plan — Dec 15–23, 2025 (America/Denver)

> **Context:** Eighth sprint (holiday mode). Short 7‑day window before year‑end code freeze (**Dec 24–Jan 1**). Emphasis on reliability, security patching, debt reduction, and low‑risk UX/assistive enhancements.

---

## 1) Sprint Goal (SMART)
Stabilize the platform ahead of freeze by meeting **all reliability SLOs**, burning down **≥ 25 critical/high defects**, completing **security patch wave Q4‑B**, and shipping **low‑risk UX/assistive improvements** (Responder Copilot **v0.2 alpha** + Graph UI **v1.2**) without increasing incident volume—**by Dec 23, 2025**.

**Key outcomes**
- Error rate and latency within SLOs for top 5 services for 14‑day trailing window.
- ≥ 25 crit/high defects resolved with root‑cause notes.
- Patch wave Q4‑B deployed (runtime + libraries) across staging → prod with audit.
- Responder Copilot v0.2 (read‑only suggestions + trace) behind flag; Graph UI v1.2 (path diff + chokepoint markers) off by default.

---

## 2) Success Metrics & Verification
- **SLO health:** Top 5 services meet availability/latency SLOs (rolling 14d).  
  *Verify:* SLO dashboards; burn‑rate alerts ≤ threshold.
- **Defect burndown:** ≥ 25 crit/high closed; reopen rate < 5%.  
  *Verify:* Tracker query; QA signoff.
- **Security posture:** Patch compliance ≥ 95% eligible fleet; 0 high CVEs remaining.  
  *Verify:* SBOM/vuln scans; change tickets.
- **Safe feature rollout:** 0 production regressions from Copilot v0.2 / Graph v1.2; flags default OFF.  
  *Verify:* Telemetry; canary cohort feedback.

---

## 3) Scope
**Must‑have (commit):**
- Reliability & Performance hardening for Services A/B/C/D/E (timeouts, retries, backpressure, DB index fixes).
- Defect burndown (≥ 25 issues): triage → fix → RCA snippets posted.
- Security patch wave Q4‑B: language runtimes, container base images, critical libs; rebuild + redeploy.
- Responder Copilot v0.2 (alpha): promptable runbooks for top 3 incident types (suggest‑only, no auto‑exec) + trace view.
- Graph UI v1.2: path diffing (T‑0 vs T‑1), chokepoint detection heuristics, freshness banner; feature‑flagged.
- Docs & Runbooks refresh: incident SOPs, on‑call guides, service ownership pages.
- Year‑end backup & restore drill: take verified snapshots; restore test in staging.

**Stretch (best‑effort):**
- Observability cleanup: reduce noisy alerts by 30%; add missing golden signals.
- SOAR v1.5.1: reviewer dashboard small UX wins (filters, bulk approve UX polish).
- Debt: flaky test suite stabilization for 3 top offenders.

**Out‑of‑scope:**
- Destructive automation changes; broad schema migrations; customer‑visible RBAC policy changes.

---

## 4) Team & Capacity (holiday‑adjusted)
- **Working days:** 7 (Mon Dec 15 → Tue Dec 23).  
- **Focus factor:** 0.75 (PTO/interrupts).  
- **Nominal ~50 pts → Commit \~**30 pts** (keep 3–4 pts buffer).**
