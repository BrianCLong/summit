# Sprint Goal

Deliver a **clean, repeatable, policy‑enforced build + test + deploy flow** so that **every PR merges, builds, and tests cleanly** by default, and the **Maestro Conductor** (autonomous build orchestration platform) can scale from here with observable, reversible releases.

---

## Success Criteria (Definition of Success)

- **0 red on main**: main branch has **no failing required checks** for 7 consecutive days.
- **100% PR compliance**: All merged PRs pass: lint, unit, contract, e2e smoke, SCA/SAST, SBOM, infra plan, migration gate, license policy, and DCO/CLA (if applicable).
- **Preview envs**: Ephemeral preview environments spin up for every PR and auto-tear-down on close/merge.
- **Canary by default**: Stage → prod uses canary with **auto-rollback** guarded by golden signals.
- **Observability**: OTEL traces, Prometheus metrics, and structured logs emitted across CI jobs and deployments; SLO dashboards green at cut time.
- **Reproducible builds**: Locked toolchains, pinned versions, cache strategy documented; build variance < 1% across two clean runs.
- **Immutable audits**: Every deploy and privileged action produces a reason-for-change and immutable audit entry.

---

## Guardrails (Policy, required going forward)

- **Branch protections**: main is protected; squash merge only; linear history; required checks cannot be bypassed.
- **PR Template + Conventional Commits** enforced; CODEOWNERS required reviews; no self-approval on critical paths.
- **IaC golden path**: Terraform + Helm with policy-as-code (OPA). Secrets only via sealed-secrets; never plaintext.
- **Migration gates**: Any schema change must include gated migration plan, dry-run in stage, and rollback script.
- **Feature flags**: New risky behavior is behind a flag with default-safe values; Admin Console tracks flags.
- **SBOM & SCA**: Build publishes SBOM; dependency updates fail on policy-violating licenses or known critical CVEs.

---

## Sprint Structure (2 Weeks)

**Timebox**: 10 working days

### Theme 1 — Pipeline Hygiene & Reliability

1. **Unify CI entrypoints**
   - Create `ci/pipeline` reusable workflows (build, test, scan, package, publish, deploy).
   - Acceptance: All repos call shared workflows; duplication removed.

2. **Fail-fast quality gates**
   - Gates: lint → unit → contract → e2e smoke → SCA/SAST → SBOM → infra plan → migration gate.
   - Acceptance: Red path stops downstream jobs; green path produces signed artifacts.

3. **Flake triage & quarantine lane**
   - Identify top 10 flaky tests by failure rate; quarantine with `@flaky` tag; open fix tickets; measure MTTR.
   - Acceptance: <1% test flake rate on main; dashboard shows trend.

4. **Hermetic, reproducible builds**
   - Pin toolchains; lockfile verification; remote cache strategy; containerized builders.
   - Acceptance: Two clean rebuilds of same commit produce identical artifact digests.

5. **Caching & artifact strategy**
   - Define cache keys; retain artifacts for 30 days; push release artifacts to registry with provenance.
   - Acceptance: Build time reduced ≥ 30% average; cache hit rate visible.

### Theme 2 — Progressive Delivery & Rollback

6. **Canary with auto-rollback**
   - Helm upgrade with progressive steps; health checks on golden signals; auto-rollback on breach.
   - Acceptance: Stage simulates rollback successfully; runbook updated.

7. **Migration gate**
   - Pre-deploy check verifies migration PR, dry-run results, and rollback plan; blocks deploy if absent.
   - Acceptance: Schema changes only merge when gate passes and dry-run artifacts attached to PR.

8. **Feature-flag discipline**
   - Standardize flag creation, ownership, default, and kill-switch; add lint rule to block unguarded risky code.
   - Acceptance: All new risky features behind flags; Admin Console shows state.

### Theme 3 — Observability & Compliance by Default

9. **OTEL everywhere**
   - Instrument CI jobs and services; propagate trace IDs from CI → app → deployer; structured JSON logs.
   - Acceptance: Trace graph shows end-to-end span from PR to prod.

10. **SLO dashboards & alerts**

- P95 latency, error rate, saturation; SLO burn alerts; cost dashboards per service.
- Acceptance: Dashboards exist for dev/stage/prod; alerts integrated with on-call.

11. **Immutable audits + reason-for-access**

- Enforce reason prompts on privileged flows; append signed audit records to tamper-evident store.
- Acceptance: Sample audit trail demonstrates who/what/why/when for a prod deploy.

12. **Security posture**

- SBOM publishing; license policy; secret scanning in CI; OPA policies on Terraform/Helm plans.
- Acceptance: No critical findings at release cut; policy checks are blocking.

### Theme 4 — Developer Experience (DevEx)

13. **Preview environments per PR**

- Automated namespace/env; seeded test data; URL surfaced in PR checks; auto-destroy on merge/close.
- Acceptance: Median preview ready time < 10 min.

14. **Fast feedback**

- Parallelize jobs; split test shards; early artifact upload; PR comment bots with summaries and links.
- Acceptance: Median time-to-green < 12 min for typical service.

15. **Templates & runbooks**

- Update PR/issue templates; add runbooks for canary, rollback, migration, incident classes.
- Acceptance: Engineers use templates; runbooks referenced in pipelines.

## Backlog (Stories & Acceptance Criteria)

### EPIC A — CI/CD Platform Unification

- **A1: Reusable pipeline modules**
  - Create shared workflows: `build.yml`, `test.yml`, `scan.yml`, `package.yml`, `publish.yml`, `deploy.yml`.
  - _Done when_: All services reference shared workflows; versioned; changelog documented.

- **A2: Required checks registry**
  - Codify required checks via repo rule sets; document mapping from checks → gates.
  - _Done when_: main branch shows all checks required; bypass impossible without admin break-glass.

- **A3: Artifact signing & provenance**
  - Sign images/packages; attach SBOM; store attestations; verify at deploy time.
  - _Done when_: Deploy blocks if signature or SBOM missing.

### EPIC B — Progressive Delivery

- **B1: Canary strategy**
  - Implement stepwise rollout (e.g., 5%→25%→50%→100%); health windows; rollback triggers.
  - _Done when_: Stage dry-run proves rollback; prod uses canary by default.

- **B2: Migration gates**
  - Pre-merge bot checks for migration plan, dry-run output, and rollback script.
  - _Done when_: Schema PRs without complete artifacts cannot merge.

### EPIC C — Observability & Compliance

- **C1: OTEL trace propagation**
  - CI job emits root span; injects tracecontext env; app and deployer continue trace.
  - _Done when_: Single trace visualizes PR→build→test→deploy→request path.

- **C2: SLO dashboards**
  - Per service: availability, p95 latency, error rate, saturation; SLO burn alerts.
  - _Done when_: Release captain checks green dashboards at cut.

- **C3: Immutable audits**
  - Write-once audit store; reason-for-access prompts; link audit ID to deploy artifact.
  - _Done when_: Audits visible in Admin Console and exportable for compliance.

### EPIC D — DevEx & Speed

- **D1: Preview env automation**
  - Namespace per PR; seeded data; smoke URL in PR.
  - _Done when_: ≥90% of PRs get previews; median ready <10m.

- **D2: Flake reduction program**
  - Flake bot; retries limited; quarantine list; owners notified; CI reports flake index.
  - _Done when_: Flake index < 0.05; no red merges due to flakes.

- **D3: Tooling ergonomics**
  - CLI `maestro` commands for local → CI parity; templates for new services.
  - _Done when_: New service bootstrap < 5 minutes with full pipeline.

## Responsibilities & Ownership

- **DevOps/Platform**: IaC, clusters, runtime, secrets, autoscaling, SLO dashboards.
- **CI/CD**: Pipelines, caches, artifacts, preview env lifecycle, policy gates, SBOM.
- **Deployment**: Canary plan, migration execution under gates, golden signal monitors.
- **Repo Arborist**: Branch protections, CODEOWNERS, labels, feature flag + migrations catalog.
- **Release Captain**: Release train, notes, rollback plan, post-release KPIs & incident loop closure.

---

## Metrics (DORA + quality)

- Lead time for change, Deployment frequency, MTTR, Change failure rate.
- Time-to-green, Cache hit rate, Flake index, Canary success rate, Rollback MTTR.

---

## Risk Register & Mitigations

- **Secret sprawl** → sealed-secrets, secret scanning, CI redaction.
- **Flaky tests** → quarantine lane, ownership, SLAs, instrumentation.
- **Policy friction** → provide exceptions flow with time-bound waivers + audit records.
- **Preview env cost** → TTL/auto-destroy; scale-to-zero; budget alerts.

---

## Integrating Maestro Conductor

- **API Contract**: Maestro triggers shared workflows via a stable API; receives provenance IDs; posts back trace IDs.
- **Telemetry**: Maestro emits OTEL spans for plan/apply/deploy; correlates with PR and release IDs.
- **Policy Hooks**: Maestro enforces gates (OPA) and blocks promotion without green dashboards.
- **Rollbacks**: Maestro can rollback to last known-good artifact automatically on breach; logs immutable audit with reason.
- **Extensibility**: New services register with a one-command bootstrap that wires build, tests, flags, and previews.

---

## Acceptance Evidence to Capture

- Screenshot/exports of green dashboards, passing checks, signed artifact attestations, audit log entries, canary success + rollback simulation report.

---

## Post-Sprint Hardening (Stretch)

- Chaos drills (monthly) and DR tabletop; cross-region replicas validated.
- Policy codification for license whitelists and data retention/purge with dual-control deletes.
- Renovate/bot for dependency updates with risk-aware rollout.
