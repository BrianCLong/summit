# Maestro Task Graph Templates

This directory contains the canonical task graph templates for common CompanyOS workflows in machine-consumable YAML format.

## Templates

*   [**New Feature from Idea → Production**](flow_feature_lifecycle.yaml)
*   [**New Tenant Onboarding**](flow_tenant_onboarding.yaml)
*   [**Incident Response (Defensive)**](flow_incident_response.yaml)
*   [**Invention & Foresight Cycle**](flow_innovation_cycle.yaml)

These templates are designed to be ingested by the Maestro Conductor for automated orchestration.
