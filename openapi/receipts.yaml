  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Contract for ingesting and retrieving provenance receipts generated by the Conductor evidence service.

    Idempotency & replay semantics:
    - `POST /api/conductor/evidence/receipt` is **not idempotent**. Each invocation creates a new signed receipt and evidence_artifacts row even when the `runId` is unchanged. Clients should deduplicate run-level submissions when replays occur.
    - `GET /api/conductor/evidence/receipt/{runId}` returns the most recently created receipt for the run (ordered by `created_at DESC`).

    Error mapping:

    | Status | Condition | Payload example |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 400 | Missing/invalid request fields (e.g., `runId` absent) | `{ "success": false, "error": "runId is required" }` |
    | 401 | Missing or invalid bearer token handled by upstream auth | `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }` |
    | 403 | Caller lacks `evidence:create` or `evidence:read` permission | `{ "error": "Insufficient permissions", "required": "evidence:create" }` |
    | 404 | Run or receipt not found for the provided `runId` | `{ "success": false, "error": "Run not found" }` |
    | 409 | Conflict when attempting to write (reserved; not emitted by current implementation) | `{ "error": "Conflict" }` |
    | 429 | Request throttled by gateway or WAF | `{ "error": "Too Many Requests" }` |
    | 500 | Unexpected server failure | `{ "success": false, "error": "Failed to generate provenance receipt" }` |
