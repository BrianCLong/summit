# API GraphQL Designer â€” Cheatsheet

**What it does:** Generate GraphQL SDL, persisted queries, pagination/backpressure, and N+1 guardrails aligned to IntelGraph SLOs.

**How to use (chat):**
1) Ask for the outcome (e.g., "Generate SDL + persisted queries for Entity v1").
2) Provide repo path and constraints.
3) This skill emits artifacts and verification steps.

**How to use (API/Agent SDK):**
- Call the `scripts/runner.ts` with input JSON; outputs artifacts to the working tree.

**SLO/COST GUARDRAILS:** Enforced per org defaults.
