description: Convert an imperative request into success criteria + tests-first loop.
---
When to use:
- Bug fixes, validation work, refactors, feature additions.

Do:
- Write failing test(s) first when possible
- Add explicit verification commands
- Loop until all criteria pass
- Summarize evidence (what failed, what changed, what now passes)
