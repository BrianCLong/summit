# a2a-bridge

This module serves as the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) bridge, facilitating secure and governed communication between agents.

It ensures that all A2A interactions are routed through MC's policy and provenance envelope, enforcing:
- OPA (Open Policy Agent) simulation
- Residency and purpose checks
- Audit logging

This bridge enables seamless agent interoperability while maintaining strict adherence to MC's guardrails.
