- Add build verification to CI pipeline

#### Key Rotation Playbook
- Implement quarterly rotation script
- Include dry-run and production modes
- Document rollback procedures

#### Customer Readiness
- Export Operator Readiness one-pager PDF
- Include ports, creds model, backup path
- Define RPO/RTO and SLO commitments

#### Security Attestation
- Add cosign attestations to releases
- Verify signatures in compose-boot CI
- Document key management procedures

### Success Metrics
- Reproducible builds achieve 100% digest match
- Quarterly key rotation exercises successful
- Operator Readiness documents downloaded >50 times
- Security attestations verified on 100% of deployments
